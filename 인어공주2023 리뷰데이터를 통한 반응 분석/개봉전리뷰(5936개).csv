I will never not read this actress’s name as Halle Berry.
Her voice seemed beautiful honestly. Just feel like little mermaid will not translate well in live action
"Am I the only one who keeps reading Halle Berry instead of Halle Bailey? I tripped the fuck out when I saw the trailer and it wasn't Halle Berry and thought ' who the fuck is that!?"" Damn I'm old"
My only problem with this movie is that it's happening at all.
"People should be more mad that the Disney version doesn’t end with Arielle turning into sea foam. Now THAT is not honoring the original.

Also, very excited for this remake cause I was a huge fan of the animated film!"
"I don’t care what color Ariel’s skin is, but if her hair isn’t red I’m not going…"
What? Racists on the internet? Surely not!
My favorite thing about Disney releasing new movies is all of the adults arguing about them as if they aren’t meant for kids.
Can disney just stop making these freaking dumb remakes?
They should have made this movie historically accurate…by casting a red haired manatee.
"When did fan reactions to things, racist or otherwise, become news? We're all perfectly capable of reading the comments and tweets ourselves. This is just amplifying the worst takes for clicks and it's nearly as bad as the takes themselves.

Maybe let's all just start downvoting these trash articles that keep popping up on the front page for some reason."
Would be great if Disney just decided to make new movies and not a steady stream of remakes that all suck anyways.
Literally the only complaint is that her hair is not brighter red. When I picture Ariel the first thing that comes to mind is firetruck red hair. Otherwise her voice sounds great and she looks fantastic.
"The story originated in Denmark. As a Dane, I feel it is my duty to always, ALWAYS, protect the TRUE image of the little mermaid....lol. she was GREEN. And Ugly.   


Regardless, the girl has presence and chops. As a Dane, I approve."
"All that teaser told me was that there was gonna be a LOT of oversinging done in the songs. Much like the end credit ""How Far I'll Go"" version in Moana. I get adding their own flare but damn it's too much. Much also like some singers do with the national anthem at sporting events."
"If this is what the entirety of the social media marketing is going to be, then I’m just not interested in these projects. Look at Amazons LOTR right now: It’s like the whole marketing team pre-planned their entire blitz around the expected race hatred. Just ignore it…"
I’m so excited to watch it. Being white has zero to do with the story so it shouldn’t matter
Nobody is talking about the fact that her OTHER HALF is being played by a dolphin!  That's not even a fish!
"I feel like this is all part of their plan at this point, since most of these remakes have been mediocre at best. Swap a couple white characters with black actors, wait for the inevitable hate it will generate, and use that to try and draw more people to the theaters."
"It looks really good and I hope I like it better than the other live action remakes. Beauty and the Beast with Emma Watson was....bad. I wanted to like it but nope. I didn't even go see the Aladdin remake because I'd heard bad things. 

The actress looks beautiful. She even kind of resembles the cartoon Ariel with her large doe eyes. Her voice is AMAZING. I'm cautiously hopeful, but Disney, you've burned me twice with your live action movies. You better not autotune anyone. And your musical sequences need to not suck. I'm still having nightmares over ""Be Our Guest""."
"Hollywood hates casting white red heads as the lead role. Name me 5 movies (without looking it up), where the lead role has been a pastey red head. I'll wait lol. It's great to be inclusive, but let's include some gingers too."
"I really wasn’t sold on her, until I heard her sing. Ariel’s voice is central to the story and Halle Bailey has the voice of an angel."
"She shouldn’t get hate for a part she got casted to play. 

However there does seem to be a shift in how certain female characters are casted with women of color: Annie, Selina Kyle, Starfire, Tinker Bell, Ariel, Annabeth Chase, Domino, April Jones, Anita Darling. 

I feel that main argument here is if the color of skin truly does not matter, so long the character is portrayed how they need to be…can the same argument be made when Bruce Wayne is played by an Asian actor, or James Bond by a Black Latino  or Goku be Middle Eastern?

If the whole idea that these characters are not real and their real life adaptation can be up to interpretation—then why is there such a fuss? Shouldn’t anyone/everyone feel free to depict them? Or am I still missing something…?"
"I'll be honest. The movie looks dumb and I don't care for it. I think it will tank like the live action Lion King and Mulan. I do like the actress and she can sing. I might watch it for laughs.

















I'm sorry, but from the trailer I just know the cgi is going to be horrible. It didn't even look like she was in the water. It looked like some sort of reflection from a green screen or something. 
Also I know they didn't throw that ugly red wig on her head. 



















I think that some movies don't need a live action remake and this is one of them. Not to mention, I would rather see more movies about black princesses than make a white one black. 






















I do think that Ariel should have been left as a white woman. From how I understand, she was a Danish children's tale. I wouldn't want to see a white Tiana from Princess and the Frog. 






















I feel like there are so many African American or even just African stories that Disney could pull from. Hell, make a movie about a black mermaid. 





















I don't think that she should recieve racist comments for it. As a Black woman, I don't condone the fact that she is recieving hate comments. 















Those are my thoughts. Honestly, I see this as Disney trying to appease black people. Instead of making another black princess movie that's not a horror like Princess and the Frog is."
Her eyes are very far apart. Definitely part fish.
It just looks boring. Not to mention they haven't had one live action that was truly impressive.
"Don’t care, remakes already beaten to death. Not for me"
"People are truly pathetic. It's a cartoon character, adults shouldn't even give a fuck about this."
Eye emoji space space eye emoji
"I hate to go against the crowd here but man Disney should not have done this. Any skin tone can be Ariel, but she got to have that red hair. Smh."
All I can say is hang in there Halle Bailey
"As a black guy, I find it funny when people are suddenly okay with ""white"" characters being recast by black people but the other way around is suddenly a problem. So weird."
"“Disney plays the same card it always plays when it is criticized”

I don’t doubt there are racists saying racist shit about this movie. But from what 99% of the population sees, race has nothing to do with it. It’s another live action movie in a long line of live action movies made for the sole purpose of protecting their IPs from the inevitable copywrite ending as well as to bolster their Disney subscriber numbers. It’s clearly a company just putting out something mediocre then getting defensive when they’re called out."
Don’t care about her race. She looks 8 and literally every Disney remake has sucked.
"As a black person this so exhausting. The trailer was beautiful, her voice is amazing I hate that the central focus for some is the colour of her skin. It’s disgusting and I’m tired, just tired."
"The media do this every time. A couple of morons taint everyone. These people need to be ignored. 

Oh and the movie looks trash."
"Instead of sending hate comments to her for simply ACCEPTING this big paid role, send your comments to the people in charge. I’m a man and I would accept this role to play a mermaid bcz I’m getting PAID among other benefits and connections that come with being famous. Blame the people who hired me"
She looks super constipated on the right.
"I mean if Sebastian was/is a Jamaican AF crab, why wouldn’t we have Black mermaids in the same Disney universe that this story clearly is based on?

The braids also make more sense for underwater life, anyway! C’mon, this isn’t *such* a stretch."
"Lmao, what are you talking about. This is exactly what Disney wanted."
The trailer just looks bad.  The last scene she just looks like sitting on a a theater stage on a rock with mermaid suit and using lighting effects to give it the caustic look.
The lion king round 2
"I read Halle Berry when I first looked at the headline, and got really confused"
Skin color doesn't matter to me.. but her hair color does!! How can Ariel not have her famous red hair? Sad. The characters in these remakes should resemble their cartoon counterparts.
Her voice is Amazing. I have to think that is why they hired her.
Saw a poster for a Obama movie and Ryan Gosling is playing him.
"What sucks about the live action is that practically every animated film is superior.


Aladdin was my favorite movie growing up and it was butchered so horribly in the remake.

At least for the little mermaid they chose someone who can sing and we don’t have to go through Emma Watson scenario (not awful) but def not broadway singing capabilities"
I just don’t like that this exists.
"She looks fucking weird in the trailer. I guess she’s not human, but mermaids are supposed to be humanoid. Fucked up if people are being racist though. Just looks like shit, honestly."
Pirates of the Caribbean On Stranger Tides (2011) already had black mermaids.
Here we go again.
"I don't care about her race, what is up with her eyes??"
It’s a mermaid.  And they think being black is the unrealistic part?
The movie just looks horrible. I could care less if it’s “black washed” and or has a trans lead role. Just make movies good
"I bet she's gonna do great as Ariel. I get that it's just a teaser, but I feel like Disney picked a bad scene to tease with. It's just dark and very static. Her singing is terrific but they couldn't have used her up on the rock with the wave splashing around her like at the end of the song in the animated version?

If people should be complaining about anything, it's Disney's re-hashing of movies they've already made in beautiful 2D animation with generic looking CGI."
"First, i don’t care that much. My literal only issue is she doesn’t have bright red hair. Everything from skin color to hair type doesn’t matter. The only thing I care about is the iconic red hair. Nothing else was iconic to me other than her res hair. Just cgi what ever os there to be bright red please."
Would it he wrong to cast an originally black character as indian or asian? Or and Indian character as native American etc.? Or is it only wrong when it’s a white person.  It’s just confusing at this point
I thought she looks ugly.   But beauty is in the eye of the beholder….so eh.  The voice is good if it was her voice.
"I mean regardless of race, she looks terrible in the teaser"
"In the original movie, Ariel's dad is Posedian, who is not from Danish mythology but instead Greco-Roman. Everyone should start complaining she is red headed and doesn't have dark hair and olive skin in the cartoon."
I love how people are more focused on the CGI or if a remake should happen than their fellow whites obsession with black people and lifelong commitment to racism.  Why do black entertainers have to suffer abuse every time they book a job?….Halle is drop dead gorgeous and has the voice of an Angel.  Where is the problem?
I am Jack’s complete lack of surprise.
I’m going to go watch Swordfish again for….. reasons.
Disney knew what they were doing. It created buzz and they love it.
I hope the people mad about the casting continue to suffer in their own bitterness and racism :)
Movie is gonna be trash anyways
"It’s vital that weird-looking little black girls with great singing voices finally know that they, too, can be a little mermaid. Representation is so important."
People all hung up on her skin tone and I’m just mad that her hair is barely red
No way this is true.  I mean we even voted a black president into office.  That was the official end of any and all racism.  This must be fake news.
Racists are more open now because trumps existence allows it.
"I know her being Black matters, but race aside, she literally seems like the perfect Ariel. I don't think they were trying to make Ariel Black, I think Halle was just the perfect cast! I'm so excited for this! Seated and ready!!!!"
Her voice sounds incredible.
"Everyone knows mermaids aren’t real right? It doesn’t matter who the fuck plays Ariel, it’s a fucking fairytale. Halle baileys voice is incredible. The original little mermaid was danish so she didn’t speak English either. Why the hell does it matter?"
Can we just reject all these racist incels and stuff? Wtf with this bullshit. Every time.
Idk how these people are missing this but the goddamn crab was Jamaican. She lived in warm tropical waters. Logic dictates she'd be darker skinned. Aaand that's where we lost them: logic.
"I saw such a dumb fuck comment that said “if Hollywood decided to cast a white actor as black panther every one would go nuts (as a way to argue against having a POC portray the little mermaid)” well yeah no shit because black panther is a character ingrained within black culture which resonates within a heavily African population, country, and environment and the sole purpose of black panthers existence was for black representation during the late 20th century

In contrast to the little mermaid that does not have a cultural racial significance or lives within a sea that is defined by the populations race and culture as a certain race, it does not matter what race Ariel is

I bet the same person that made this comment didn’t complain when evangelicals made Jesus white…"
"I’ve literally never read the headline of this subs posts and thought they held merit.

I keep trying to get Reddit to stop feeding me shit from this tabloid of a sub.

It’s 2022. Why can’t we just fucking block subs?!"
"So with millions of people online. It’s pretty much going to guaranteed that people are scumbag assholes right…? Soooo, people will literally never not be racist, sexist, transphobic, whateveric you wanna say. So at this point it’s just an excuse to be unimaginative and lazy."
She has a great voice but the hair is bothering me.
"Stop with all the racial bullshit... Jesus
Divide and conquer is old trick in book!!!"
"A fictional underwater sea cryptid, loosely based on a very old danish book, translated into a kids movie musical, then brought to life in a cg live action movie…like who fucking cares…if she can sing and act then that’s all that matters.

CONTENT OF CHARACTER, NOT THE COLOR OF THEIR SKIN.

How is that concept so difficult to understand for some people?"
Racists gonna racist
"My only question with any production that ""features omg such diversity wow"" is... will it be any good? Because the people who think it's so unbelievably important to show ""diversity"" are the exact people most likely to turn ""The Little Mermaid"" into ""Dat Shorty Mermizzle""."
I never seem to see all the outrage… I just see all the folks reacting to the outrage.
I think we all knew this shit was gonna happen. Fucking racist shitbags need to STFU forever
White ppl don't be racist online challenge (impossible)
"Every one of these live action remakes has been complete shit. I don't expect that will change for any reason. That said, she certainly doesn't deserve any of the alleged hate she may or may not be getting.

Disney, can we please get some more original IPs? Put those overpaid writers to work on something new and fresh. The old ones are fine the way they are."
"I'm a 42 year old white male and I loved the original as a kid, but I give zero shits about what race a fucking mermaid is. It's time that Hollywood start putting more marginalized groups in lead roles instead of putting them in supporting roles or typecasting them. Stay mad racists."
It’s crazy to me people are so okay being openly racist pieces of shit they’ll harass a child because of her skin color
"JFC. Imagine the fragility it must take to live in a world with TWENTY movies based on the same story (in all of which the protagonist was white) and absolutely lose your shit when a single one comes out in which the mermaid has a different skin tone. 

Let’s also break that down even more: people are heatedly tweeting hate speech because the mythical creature that is half-woman and half-fish and lives in the ocean and has her voice stolen by a sea witch in exchange for legs. 

But the fish-woman has a different skin tone. That simply will *not* stand. 

I can’t believe that is a sentence I have to write."
Wtf is wrong with people? She is a beautiful girl with a great voice. Shut the fuck up with the racist bullshit.
Next thing you are gonna tell me Santa or Jesus isn't white.
"Hateful people acting like they even cared about The Little Mermaid in the first place, they only pretend to care now because the actress is black. Overall, the film is directed towards kids, if you don’t like it, then stop commenting on it. Seriously, stop wasting your energy on a film you’ll never see. She sounds great and I’m sure the movie will be good."
"It seems that people have a problem with a person of color playing a role that was once white, but when studios do make original content centering diverse people, people say they are pandering. It seems like a lose/lose situation either way."
"LOL at everyone in the comment section. “I’m not racist, but i don’t understand why they can’t just make every character stay white. Especially when the race has zero relevance to the story.”"
Racists need to be fired into the sun. I feel scared to criticize the teaser because I don’t want to be lumped in with those scum
My kid wanted to put on a dinosaur costume while running around outside to have a good time. That evil shit doesn’t have scales and putting on fake ones is disgusting and disrespectful to all reptiles. I beat him mercilessly just to show my neighbors how much integrity I have!
"It’s hard to tell from the split second sneak peak, but I just wish they brought the colors from her tail more into her skin tone.
I would be saying this regardless of the ethnicity of the actress. 

She’s a mermaid. It would have been cool to see less human and more mystical creature.

On another note- holy smokes, that voice!"
This culture war will never stop at this point. From lotr to this.
"I hope the poor girl can ignore the comments and take care of her mental health dealing with this. And half these racists are trying to justify it saying “well she didn’t look like that in the book or animated movie!”.  If you don’t like it, simply don’t watch it. (Which I expect most of the people crying about it weren’t going to see it anyway)"
People are so cruel. She’s just trying to make a living. Leave her alone.
I cannot believe how much people care about insignificant crap like this
"BAILEY. Bailey.  

Just clicked finally. Anyway, people, it's a mermaid. Fictional creature. Can come in any flavor the writers want."
"Why do people care so damn much? I mean it’s a mermaid. They’re fictional anyway. They could be purple and I wouldn’t give a damn.

Some people need to grow the hell up."
Racist people are the true idiots of this sometimes very confusing world.
wtf. people need to get a life.
"The racists tend to have hissy fits when people of color fill what was traditionally, a role filled by a Caucasian individual. They want is to go back to the days when minorities weren’t represented in the movies or on TV- you know, when America was “great”."
"Disney needs to stop ruining classic Disney cartoons by making live action adapted versions . Also, Ariel is not black. Another bad idea. Black adaptions of every single movie, TV series, or story is not necessary. Some things need to remain as is."
"She’s darling! 

Looking forward to see it."
"Ok, but is it any good? or is this gonna be yet another ""its crap but we are gonna deflect with focusing on the 7 shitheads being racists""?"
This isn’t news. Everyone knew THAT side of Twitter was going to complain about this. Don’t give it attention and move on.
"People arguing over the perceived race of a mermaid......So you accept the mermaid portion, but being non-white is a bridge too far?  

Haven't they got better things to do"
"Holy hypertelorism

For real I dislike all the live action remakes but she doesn’t deserve racial animus"
"My guess is her voice won that role for her.  Damn, can that woman sing.  Good for her."
Looks and sounds beautiful. I mean what a beautiful voice
"She does have a great voice honestly, and she and her sister show alot of skin. So thats nice. Im a simple man, an honest man."
Ariel is black - who the fuck cares? What did the color of Ariel’s skin have to do with the story? Fuck all. So why does it matter?
"Ok at first I was thinking, why can't they make original black characters?

But then I heard her sing and was like 'this works'

Characters are fictional anyways and everyone has their interpretations. All this hate from certain folks on the internet is very revealing."
You know this is the first time I actually like a white character who was changed  black idk what it is but she looks like she’s supposed to be the little mermaid they did an amazing job
"She doesn’t look like Ariel to me, but she pretty af"
"The backlash at this point is predictable. Ignorant people who have 0 investment in the IP spewing their stupidness (without even seeing the movie) because change scares them.

She sounds amazing, hope the movie is as good."
"I'll defend her against the racist trolls, but damn she cant' sing in that preview. It sounded awful. Where she tries to over sing the song."
"Where was this energy when Lilly James (BROWN EYES) was cast as Cinderella, a blue eyed character!!! Blue eye erasure is real folks!! The woke left has gone too far!! This is what y’all dumb mfs sound like"
Are people still surprised that there are assholes on that Internet? I wonder when people will realize how stupid it is to pay attention to this stuff
No publicity is bad publicity.
No one would say it to her face bottom line. Internet warriors
Every single bit of new media has racist trolls nowadays
My current favorite racist theory is she can’t be black their is no sun light at the bottom of the ocean. How could her skin be dark. Like damn. That’s just some lazy ass shit there.
Thought she would suck but after watching that trailer I was hooked on her voice her angelic face and impressive CGI work.  I look forward to this movie
Here come the tide of racists who are going to claim it’s the writing they actually don’t like.
Something about it doesn’t look right. This might be a little too ambitious for Disney but we’ll see.
When I saw the thumbnail for the teaser I  already knew that some folks would be up in arms.
"You know what I thought was interesting about the Disney movie, her father seemed to only have daughters right? Was he sad he had no sons which would have been a bigger deal back in ancient times? Also granted, it’s been years since I’ve seen the movie but what happened to Ariel’s mother? Did the evil sea witch kill her? Also we are to assume Prince Eric is European right? Was he of British heritage? Also Ariel’s dad reminded me of Zeus and Ursula reminds me of a monster in Greek mythology. Is that coincidence or did the Danish author take ideas from Greek mythology?"
What is anybody complaining about? It sounds like her voice is on point for the role. Is that not the most important feature for Ariel?
"The issue is no one is ever going to be completely happy with one thing or another in a Disney remake.

It follows the original too closely, it doesn't follow it closely enough, they cut this part out, they added this part in, the actor who plays character X is too different from how the previous actor portrayed character X, character Y is too (physically or otherwise) different from how they were portrayed in the original.

As it is, a 60 second teaser trailer isn't nearly enough to get a full opinion on a full length movie. I have my reservations, but until I see more than just a few seconds of a girl underwater in a dark cave, I'm going to hold back on having an actual opinion."
I just don't like the live action remake trend in general. I really don't care at all about who they cast. I would much rather Disney focus on making original animated movies that aren't Pixar.
Imagine being mad about THIS. So much going on in the world and you want to be mad about this. Literal first world problems.
"How many times are we going to trot these stories out as if they actually mean anything? There have always been idiots. There will always be idiots. This is not newsworthy.  Stop trying to push your BS with these ""news items."""
Oh the stupidity in these comments over a Disney movie. Humans really are the worst.
"At what point can we just ignore this crap. There’s always going to be a few guys on the internet saying dumb things. I feel like we have this headline every time anything comes out. It’s terrible, but it’s giving to large a voice to the few idiots spewing it."
What makes me laugh is Ariel is a fictional character…. As far as I know Mermaids don’t belong to a specific race so… not sure what the issue is. I can’t even imagine having to deal with the crap she gets.
I WISH LIZZO WAS URSULA!!!!!
Fuckin Mr Potato Head is trans?  That’s it I’m fuckin outta here
Why racial slurs ? What she do ??
"“I imagine one of the reasons people cling to their hates so stubbornly is because they sense, once hate is gone, they will be forced to deal with pain.”"
She has a great voice
"She sounds like Ariel. I could understand if she didn't sound like the character but it sounds like a good fit. There are other videos of her signing, which I listened to when she was announced and I think she is a good choice.  From my understanding they had a white actress lined up (Hit Girl) and she backed out, Halle Bailey was their second choice."
"Why can't people just like/not like what they saw and NOT be racist?

I didn't like what I saw in the trailer but I'll still probably give it a proper chance when it comes to D+"
"I don't mind that they're casting a non-white person for this role, I do just find it odd that the first iteration of the Little Mermaid in live action is out to do that. It's not on-the-nose casting whatsoever, and a stretch to compare the two ""Ariel"" characterizations. I'm sure I'll not watch it anyway, because I'm a 30 year old male who does not fit the demographic. Color me uninvolved."
"I am convinced that when a trailer goes over badly, studios send their PR teams to post racist messages in the comments in the hopes of getting people to defend their terrible trailer."
"She's a beautiful singer, I think they picked the perfect person to play Ariel."
This country is really disgusting. I’m so sick of these anti woke freaks everywhere.
Aladdin was pretty dang good.
We all knew it was coming especially in the current political climate.
"I literally haven't seen one post criticizint the casting. I hope Disney don't fall into the trap Rings Of Power did. I never seen anyone talk about race apart from your usual right wing YouTubers until the Amazon's marketing team started engaging. Then it started blowing out of proportion until almost every coverage about ROP is about the race. HBO did not engage and now no one cares about the race bent characters on House Of The Dragon while Rings of Power PR is nothing about the show itself but all about being on defense about their choices.

That kind of PR turns off everyone, even those who didn't care in the first place. No wonder HOTD had a more successful rollout because the coverage on it is all about how good it actually is instead of ROP's coverage all about how inclusive it is and how the previous LOTR stars support the changes Amazon made. 

Social Media algorithms are set based on engagements so when they start pushing content on everybody's feed they'd go with what's being engaged the most. Never searched for ROP but all the post leaking on my feed is always about the race of actors playing it while HOTD posts leaking on my feed are all memes made out of the latest episode."
"I care nothing about the movie, I care nothing about who portays a Greek mermaid. I care a lot about how unflattering the angle is in the in film sneak peek."
I can’t wait for this movie to come out and piss off these white folks even more 😂
"Not my Ariel, sorry, but her voice is lovely and I’m sure she’ll do the songs justice. I just wonder how this will effect Disney parks parades and meet and greets."
Hey if you do not like something you can simply not watch it! I haven’t personally watched it but I watched the trailer and she absolutely killed it!
"I’m so excited. So many ppl complaining about how dark the visuals look, but I think it looks like a beautiful oil painting, so mysterious and enchanting. I hope it’s going to be good!!"
"I miss the good old days when we used to tell racists to shut the fuck up and ignore whatever they said. 


 Now it’s all “OMG, did you hear what the racists said? It’s awful!”"
..........just confirming what we’ve been saying since time immemorial.
"My main thing is why choose someone like her who has such a sexualised image unless the intention is to expose kids to such things? You know they’ll want to Google an actress they like and they’ll see her red carpet photos, music career etc"
"I personally do not care for the new Little Mermaid movie, probably be awful, I just move on with my life instead of giving the movie anymore attention."
"Hold up, I thought this live action remake came out years ago."
John Smith Angry Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
"I just have no idea how they’re going to make this movie look good. If it’s anything like the live action Lion King, it’s going to try way too hard to look realistic in a creepy way - which is going to be particularly unattractive to the eye in an underwater setting. The original cartoon looked great because of all the vibrant colors and exaggerated humanoid sea creatures. Nemo was able to pull it off because of the art style not trying to be realistic… this doesn’t seem to be the case with TLM. We got a glimpse of Flounder in the trailer and I have a feeling he got so little screen time because he probably looks like a creepy talking fish. I’m thinking bluish-yellowish Big Mouth Billy Bass creepy. Hell, just imagine how bad Sebastian is going to look in live action. This movie was probably a bad idea from an art perspective but who cares if it’s profitable I guess."
I hope the color palette is better than that little snippet.
Kind of off topic but I could have sworn this movie was being advertised or something years ago. Did it just take a long time to release. I remember the racial topics coming up then too.
Modern media must really hate redheads.
Honestly who gives a shit about another Disney remake
I think people are just sick of classics being remade more than anything else
Race aside that hair is not it
"Yeah, I get it's a teaser, but none of the entirely CG shots looked good"
None of the Disney live action movies have been good.  The best you can hope for are good renditions of the songs.
It looked murky and a little sad. Hopefully it brightens up in post production.
"Yeah. Sucks that racists will be racists and so criticism like yours (which is valid and honestly applicable to all Disney live-action remakes) will not be taken on its face but get subsumed in the rightful push back against racists. 

Racists just ruin shit for everyone."
all of the live actions are mid
You should read the originally story probably the most messed up and racist story in I believe brothers Grimm maybe Hans Christian
Same like damn if it was Berry I would’ve watched it
I have an issue with the casting. Specifically Melissa McCarthy as Ursula. She has entirely the wrong humour and presentation style for a character based on Divine.
Why is that problem?  How does this movies existence affect your life in any way?
People would lose their minds if you made a version that was faithful to the original text. Same with anything from the Grimms Brothers.
Hey as long as the sea foam is white we're good /s
Yes! I used to love the anime version that stayed true to the original story.
It's red-ish.
When I heard my mind went scientific and was like how does a creature that lives on the ocean floor have any dark pigmentation at all she should be white as a ghost as darker pigmentation is not necessary with very little sun then again she also would not have any good eyes. The whole concept of mermaids is weird
"She has red locs. Looks fine imo, but this is also an underwater shot so it would probably be brighter in better lighting"
Hold up. A physical attribute of a character matters?
Not just on the Internet. These pieces of shit are everywhere.
"I'm not racist, how could the worlds best race be racist?"
"Yeah, literally if you didn’t see this coming you’re an idiot. Not even a news story."
Its mainly reddit lmfao
I do not believe you sir. Evidence?
"I don't think these remakes *are* meant for kids.  Kids like the newer animated movies.  They are less interested in these live action remakes than the adults who grew up with the originals.  Disney is relying a lot on nostalgia, when they remake these older animated movies."
"The Lion King (2019) made 1.6 billion in the box office to become the 8th highest box office of all time. As long as it keeps working, they’ll make these crappy remakes because it’s stupid for them not to. 

The remakes are made for whole families. Butts in seats. It’s a safe, wide appeal with good enough stories and highly funded visuals."
My friend and I argued about a kids movie once and we both paused and said wait… tf are we doing? I’m not the demographic this is aimed at and here I am upset about the shitty graphics (or whatever) lol. Adults forget that we’re adults sometimes.
"The way people bitched about the trailers, you would think they were going to be strapped to a chair and forced to watch on repeat."
“New” movies. It’s literally targeted at adults who saw the OG’s as kids.
"The worst complaint is when people say ""these kids aren't mature or acting like adults"""
"Yup, right wingers complaining they hated Ms Marvel because “it wasn’t dark and gritty enough”

It’s a slice of life kids show!"
Its an inability to allow kids to play with the toys.
they're sociopaths.
They're also arguing about snow white
Welcome to Reddit where that happens all the time
"Not sure where this sentiment comes from. A lot of these movies like Pinocchio, The Jungle Book, The Little Mermaid, etc are all clearly nostalgia bait. Sure, kids are part of the audience with a family friendly movie they want hit but nostalgia bait movies like this are clearly targeted at adults first for member berries."
Problem is my kid didnt even know that was Ariel because the character got changed so much... so if its meant for kids they are already missing the mark.
Parents don’t watch movies with their kids?
Like with the emoji movie
That’s been my life even pre Disney being a Star Wars fan.
They'll stop when they are not profitable...
"It's all a cash grab. Even though people find the remakes dumb or pointless, it also seems people are still going to see them anyway. As they're pumping boat loads of money for Disney.

Aladdin's budget was about $183M. It was critically panned mostly. And people were writing the movie off as bad just off the trailers. It still went on to make about $1B in the box office...same thing with The Lion King. A $250m budget. Not favored highly by critics or the audience. Went on to make $1.66B.

If Disney can make billions off of these lazy live action remakes then they don't have a reason to stop."
"It's free money for them, and the audiences who see them do enjoy them too."
dumb? It’s pretty genius tbh.
No they already announced all the remakes they were working on years ago. None of this is new.
Can racists stop believing in this dumb white replacement bullshit?
I like the live action remakes. Beauty and the Beast was good
"Meh. I’ll probably watch it. I think some of them are really good. I mean, lots of companies beat a dead horse… like how many Minion movies do we really need?"
People have to stop paying money to see them first.  For us your attention on the them.
What would you prefer instead?
They literally do both.
"Jungle Book was good, the rest are ass."
"Or both, like the Gargoyle’s franchise. 

That would slap as a live action. And hey, the police officer Elisa, who is a main character, is interracial (black and native American)."
"I mean, they do that too. To a much higher degree"
"I mean, if they make lots of money on adaptations, why stop what works for them? People didn’t *have* to see Aladdin, but they did and that made at least $1 billion worldwide. The jungle book live remake just under $1 billion. The CGI Lion king remake more than $1.5 billion. If people are watching these movies to make around a BILLION dollars worldwide, why would Disney stop? Even if the remakes suck, tens of millions of people are watching these movies anyway, so clearly there’s a market for them."
I know! Disney hadn’t put out a single new movie in like a whole year! Oh wait…
"Ariel is the daughter of Posedian, she should be GRECO-ROMAN!! 

/s"
A mermaid is not a race-based thing. The sea stretches the entire globe. Idt the song is “under the river in Europe”
The LOTRs thing is good so far.
"Facts. The live action remakes so far have been just ehh. I didn't mind Beauty and the Beast. Aladdin just had no shot of doing justice to the original.

But worst of all was the Lion King. Ever since the Lion King remake, I have had a passionate distaste for any live action remakes Disney decides to pump out."
I actually like the Beauty and the Beast remake. Same with Aladdin. Lion King was bad though.
Aladdin was good. Lion King was trash
"Yeah, the live BatB was not good. The ‘be our guest’ scene was weird. Like, you’re a 16th century peasant, I feel like seeing that whole display would get more of a reaction. It must be really hard to act with only a green screen, though."
"Having seen the Broadway version of ""The Little Mermaid"" (I miiiight be a fan girl), I look forward to the live action. Especially if it keeps the Broadway backstory of how Tritan screwed his sister Ursula out of half the kingdom.

That said, maybe Disney should put that effort into something original instead. Since I can't think of any African fairy tales off the top of my head, I assume any movie based on one would be unique."
Princess and the Frog is based on a German fairytale and it adapted just fine.  Brandy played Cinderella in the ‘90s and it was fine.  Just because racists are complaining doesn’t mean there is anything wrong with this casting.
"Feels kinda cringe lately how around almost every corner there is somebody complaining about something that doesn't really matter to the audience focus.

Maybe I spend too much time around Nintendo communities but it often is just 30 year olds pissed off games aren't hitting the same dopamine levels of nostalgia they had when they were younger going off for hours about how childhood with the Gamecube is better than your childhood with the Switch.

It's like God damn let people enjoy things.

Not complaining at you OP of comment just adults that shouldn't even give a fuck about things. Oh god **am I like that too**."
Maybe gingers; the redhead diversity curse continues.
Agreed. And anyone trying to hide behind “it’s always been this way” mentality is pathetic and racist but trying to pretend.
"This is what I’ve said since she was cast. She’s not playing a role that was originally white, because Ariel wasn’t white, she wasn’t anything at all, she was a cartoon character that *is made up*"
It's actually crazy how long this movie took to finally get footage shown. I remember people getting mad about this year's ago when they said it would be a black actress. It was literally 3 or 4 years ago it's just weird
This thread is full of them
"I knew the second I saw the trailer where this was gonna go, predictable, exhausting behavior."
"Yep. I can hear it now. Mermaids can only be white, Another fictional character that does not exist irl"
Honestly locs make more sense underwater than combed hair.
"I think they were deliberate in this to suit her skin toned , and went with locs as well because black hair texture does better getting wet if styled this way otherwise it can be hard to do extensive water scenes :)"
That’s fair.  Ariel’s one defining physical characteristic is red hair.
It’s probably because the iconic red hair don’t accommodate the actress.   But this is more brown than red.
It's exhausting to be
That didn't stop Cinderella from being black
"If race plays a role in the story I understand being upset about changing the race of a character. However, the color of her skin plays zero part in the story. But you do know what plays the part of the character. The ability to fucking sing. And she can fucking sing."
"Ariel’s skin color was white, not her race. Nowhere in the original story (or even the cartoon tbh) was her ‘race’ ever clarified"
"Is her skin color critical to the plot?

I dont give two fucks how old the character is, its a fucking Mermaid. We are not rewriting history here."
If she playing Marilyn Monroe I would get it. But mermaids  aren’t real. Its so weird when people hate on fictional characters.
Stories and characters are allowed to change. Ariel being white is not central to the story whatsoever.
Just ignoring the crab with the Caribbean accent. But people throw up and arms about a fictional mermaid being black.
I get ur take on this and agree. But that still doesnt stop the racists from doin it even if the character was meant to be a POC.
"Get the absolute fuck outta here with this shit take. Almost every influential real person in history has been whitewashed once before but y'all are gonna bitch about a cartoon? That's next level pathetic.

Edit for all you fucknuts downvoting me: Ben Affleck,  a white man, played Tony Mendez in Argo, Christian Bale and Joel Edgerton played ancient Egyptians in Exodus: Gods and Monsters,  Jennifer Connelly playing an El Salvadorian in A Beautiful Mind, Jim Sturgess and Kate Bosworth in 21 as asian americans, Mena Suvari in Stuck was actually an African American woman......I could literally go on with this whitewashing list for decades. These are not characters, these are actual human beings that were turned white for movies."
"In what way does Ariel’s race affect the storyline of The Little Mermaid?  

You don’t like inclusion for inclusion’s sake?  Hav- have you heard her sing?  Do you even give a shit about the story, or are you just taking up the tiki torch talking points?"
Have you heard her sing?!? It’s not inclusion for inclusion’s sake. Her skin color makes absolutely no difference to the story.
"This. Her voice is absolutely phenomenal. I think she’ll be a great Ariel and have hope this will fall along Cinderella, Jungle Book, Christopher Robin, and Cruella as one of the good remakes."
It’s the same kind of people who are getting mad about POC in LOTR
"Literally the only problem I have is that Disney gets to pat themselves on the back for being inclusive even though it’s almost certainly disingenuous, while also doing a bunch of other fucked up things and becoming closer to being the monopoly they want to be."
Turns out racists are assholes and make a big deal where there should none.
"These news articles are always just a few idiots or trolls on twitter posting something and then a few twitter users reacting to the original twidiots. 

There's never been a controversy about it, they dig deep to find them to sell the controversy."
I think that if they just made her hair red there would be no problem. Honestly it’s what I think of when I think of the little mermaid not the color of her skin.
"Openly racist people, on the internet!"
Santa's pretty damn white but Jesus probably wasn't apparently.
Black Jesus is absolute fire.  Played by the guy who did Lamar from GTA V.  Love that show.
What skin color do you think Santa has?
White really love getting mad over the race of fictional characters
"That's what I'm thinking too. Doesn't matter her skin color, but make her a realistic looking mermaid with a tail that doesn't stand so much out like she's just a girl in a costume. Granted we only see a few seconds of her tail, but I hope she looks as real as Daryl Hannah did in Splash."
They’re trying to apply evolutionary theory to imaginary cryptids… wow.
"I think her father is supposed to be an expy of Poseidon.  They never addressed the only daughters thing, but it was probably relevant that she was the seventh daughter.  Once you reach that level of spare, it’s not as big a deal for the princess to run off to another species.  Not like she was ever realistically in line for the throne."
Not the same
Does she have a sexualized image? I’ve literally never seen her anywhere or heard about her outside of her being mentioned in this role.
"The colors were muddy, too.

I don’t care if it gets oversaturated, but make the colors vivid!"
Give it time. Their just really starting on the CGI. Most teasers look like trash in that department and then they clean up most of it before release.
am i the only one upset by her extremely flimsy fins? Looked like silk cloth under water. Like that isn't how aquatic creatures gain momentum... they should be somewhat rigid.
"Yes this, I watch all the live actions with an open mind I HATE all of them. The only ones I enjoy are maleficent and I think that’s because it’s not an actual remake but they actually bothered to be creative and I think it’s Genius. I’d love to see an Ursula movie with background of “when I lived in the palace” for example."
I prefer the live action Jungle Book over the original.
I thought live action Aladdin was fine. I actually enjoyed live action Beauty and the Beast.
I don’t get this. I honestly think most have been really enjoyable. People are just hung up on nostalgia. It’s not like the original animated movies were masterpieces of storytelling. They just defined most peoples youth.
Hey they did a pretty good job on beauty and the beast
And they always come up short. Most of the new renditions have been weak
"Aladdin and Beauty and the Beast were good, jungle book was ok, Malificent was amazing if we count that. The rest were terrible"
Your absolutely correct I like t the fact she was brought on. Sadly the original Hans Christian Andersen little mermaid story is probably the most racist story I’ve read out of all the brother’s Grimm and Hans stories Disney made into movies.
It's not a secret that alot of Disney movies are adaptations of much darker stories
"I thought the Aladdin live action was pretty good. Same with the recent beauty and the beast. I think the ones that don't translate well to live action involve talking/singing animals, like lion king, or in this case little mermaid."
"I enjoyed Aladin and beauty and the beast. 

Didn't bother with lion king."
Halle Berry #isMyAriel
"> based on Divine

Should’ve cast Travolta"
I remember the rumor that Lizzo was gonna get the part. That would have been cool to see
It should have been the drag queen Ginger Minj who had the right vibe and sings very well.
I wish they had brightened the saturation on her hair and really gone for it! It just looked blah.
No it’s definitely red. Way closer to Ariel’s red than a typical ginger’s hair would be
Um yea. Unless your blind.
"Hey, shit is natural and comes from our bodies. They would give even shit a bad name. 

Let’s call them what they are: Evil"
Pygmy Pride Worldwide!
"Its literally every piece of media claiming this these days.

Now, I can believe it in some instances. But seriously where is the overlap between people who like and care about The Little Mermaid and vehemently racist assholes. And if we say there isn't much of an overlap and its just trolls being racist to instigate, then paying them any attention at all is stupid...Unless of course its good for marketing.

And you will also generate shills who, despite the quality of the movie, will feel the need to defend it regardless because if they were to be too critical then it would seem like ""the racists won."" You couldn't come up with better marketing if you tried."
It’s for the parents who have kids now that were kids when the original came out. They both can enjoy it.
"I think Disney relies on nostalgia to get bigger audiences when making these remakes, but I think they’re still made for kids that the rest of the family will still enjoy. Or even if it’s “aimed” at the adults, it’s also made in a way for the kids to enjoy it. The music, the humor, the generally basic story. Kids watch live action shows on Nickelodeon and Disney, so it’s not like live action is a problem. And they probably don’t care about “oh it’s a remake” since there’s a good chance a lot of today’s children haven’t watched or care about a movie that’s more than 3 decades old that they didn’t get to watch in a movie theatre."
Yep. My kids didn’t even make it though 30 minutes of that live action Pinocchio
Thats literally false. Tell me you don’t have kids or are in charge of kids without telling me.
That's right- you're supposed to do that about the Hobbit Movies like grown folks.
"It’s targeted towards anyone who likes Disney, the majority of which are kids or people with kids. 

Besides, I was making a blanket statement. It doesn’t seem to matter what Disney puts out, adults always have something to say."
It’s targeted at anybody with money. Disney couldn’t care less who sees this so long as they pay.
"Not really, for both really."
“Blame”? What exactly went wrong?
"But… why should people get mad if you got cast? Clearly the people who hired you had a reason. If anything they’ll take a hit at the box office, but if that’s the type of movie the people who hired you want to make… weird, but okay… not sure it’s good to promote any hate comments or blame either way…."
"> send your comments to the people in charge

Or maybe, don't send your dumb fucking comments to *anyone* involved?"
"A part of me feels like Disney has done a disservice to Halle Bailey, casting her in this role.  Her voice is *amazing* and I feel like she deserved a breakout first role free of the baggage a remake of a childhood classic was *obviously* going to have.  But, man, as much as I *loved* the original, I hope this role works out for her and people come around."
"4 y.o. goes 

“Ariel looks different”

I said “Honey this is another Ariel. Sometimes characters look different in cartoons than in real life”

She goes “She changed her hair!”"
Of course it’s a cash grab. Disney is in the business of making money and that’s not even a criticism. They don’t do this stuff for fun.
"The global movie market is way way bigger than it was 30 years ago, and I'm pretty sure that's why these remakes make so much."
"Taking advantage of people for profit: its not dumb it's genius.

Capitalism in a nutshell."
No that's the point its been taught to them from thier parents and grandparents that even the worst off white person is better then the richest black person. Because of color of thier skin. Racism  is taught at home no where else.
The animated movies of today are the live actions of the future! It’s a cycle of having never to come up with a money maker every few years when you already got some in the back pocket.
"LMAO, like what is this guy saying. I don’t get the people who don’t like the live action movies, just dont fucking watch them. The original ones are still there. If you don’t like the new James Bond Movies, watch the original ones. People are mad because they have … OPTIONS?!?"
"Maybe if they should focus on one, this clearly has not gone in their favor"
A live action Gargoyles would be pretty sick...
"Did you ever see the Cinderella remake?

Had an amazing cast, and while the general plot was the same, a lot was changed and fleshed out

Such a good movie

Edit: and I’m definitely not talking about the Camilla Cabello one"
"I can't get over the fact that the Lion King remake is being called ""live action"" by anyone."
I'm not the only one!
"I couldn’t make it through the first 10 mins of Aladdin, but my toddler (at the time) loved Lion King, so I’ve seen that one… a lot. Animals don’t emote, they all looked bored, hahaha."
"It would be so much better. I would love to see an original black fairytale. I would even appreciate a Native American original. Pocahontas is a complete lie. 














I just don't want to see a black adaption of Ariel. Honestly, it doesn't look that good. I feel like the cgi is horrible and the wig looks ridiculous."
"I have never heard that before. I will look that up. 














I never liked the Brandy adaption.  I never liked Cinderella. 

















I don't care what racists are complaining about. I am making my own complaint as a Black woman. I want to see original black fairytales as a black woman. I don't want to see a Danish movie made black so Disney can appease the masses.















I also don't think the trailer looks good. I have nothing against the actress as I said in my original text if you read it."
And the amount of effort others put into discussing it at length to come up with “theories” as the why they are like that is also annoying.
There are so many things to enjoy out there. Life is too short to spend on things you don't enjoy.
yeah it does seem like you spend to much time on the internet.. go outside and youll find people in general complain much less.
It's just closeted racism. It's a cartoon character and they're sending this woman death threats. That is beyond ridiculous.
"I’m against the racism towards actress.  My thought is “if you don’t like it, it’s not for you. Move along”. And why do these people act like these actors wrote and script and cast themselves.

However, she was a white cartoon character based on a white danish fairy tale.  Let’s not act if it wouldn’t be a big deal if the script was flipped."
"That Cinderella with Brandy and Whitney Houston in it from idk, the 90’s? That was one of my favorite movies ever as a kid. I thought she was absolutely gorgeous."
Halle has a godly voice. Her singing is amazing but these closeted racists only see her color. There is no Ariel ever that has vocal range like Halle has.
And that's the right answer.
She is the daughter of Trident. Which is based on Poseidon. A Greek God. The character reflects the people who wrote them.
"Yeah; there’s the camp of “Ariel looked like X and they changed it for inclusion sake” and the camp of “black person is the lead in this movie how dare they”. The racist jerks in camp 2 should be disliked by everyone, even if they appear to be on the same side regarding how they feel about the casting choice. 

Racists and other discriminatory camps can join lots of sides; we need to be able to separate them from their side to go “those people are terrible even if they’re agreeing” and “those people who are terrible agree on this subject so all people agreeing on that subject are terrible”. Racist slurs have no place pretty much anywhere at this point in time."
"Everyone knows it's a historical fact that all mermaids are 100% white cis het women!  This movie is erasing important white history. 

/s"
Right! Like you know hobbits are fictional right? It’s mind blowing. Then they always come back with something like “ how would it be if a white guy played Martin Luther king jr.?” Like motherfucker he was a real person! Why is this even a conversation!
The non white Santa is a Fox News dig :) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhSH1b0\_KLk
Slink Johnson is such a great fit on Black Jesus. Esp when he's on screen with Charlie Murphy and John Witherspoon doing the most.
What color is your dads skin?/s It was an old Fox News dig they lost their mind when someone said Santa could be black. Transparent is my guess for his skin color.
Sorry I should have dropped the /S
She's actually very tame for her genre. Or for a woman celeb in general she's fairly tame in terms of sexualization of her image. Not to say it isn't there.
Eh I don't mind muddy colors
"Personally I think that as animation moves to hyper-realism, it loses the magic that comes from an animated or artistic world. The real world can be beautiful, but it’s not magical. I felt none of that in the trailer. 

It looks like animation that would have been cutting edge and used in a big budget project in the early 2010’s. Today it feels so lifeless in what’s supposed to be a wonderful film."
"I'm sure you're right (I genuinely don't know), but I also don't understand why you'd release footage in that shape for your marketing campaign?"
"Now that Pinnochio is out, I don’t have hope."
"Is this going straight to Disney+? If so, I don't have high hopes for the CG improving."
"Honestly with how bad the CGI has been in all of Disney/marvel films lately, I have little hope it’ll look good in the end."
"By that standard, why does a mermaid have hair? It's just a liability underwater. Mermaids should be smooth and fatty like a dolphin."
"I'm not upset about the anatomy of them, no, because that really doesn't matter, especially in a movie like this, just the quality of rendering looked bad"
They look kinda flimsy in the original too.
"Aladdin was good up until the breakdancing and Jasmine's empowerment song. It didn't fit the rest of the soundtrack and they took out the part where Jasmine almost defeated Jafar for a crappy song. Ironically, best part of the movie was the one everyone was worried about, Will Smith's Genie. Too bad he slapped it all away."
"Beauty and the Beast was really well done, Aladdin was pretty good, Mulan ick"
My kids loved the live action Aladdin. I thought the parade sequence was unfortunately scales back but overall Will Smith did an admirable job reprising the classic role.
Some of them were in fact masterpieces of storytelling. Especially in the music dept.
"Yeah, they’re all solid at worst. 

And some of them like Cruella are great movies."
"I thought the new Pinocchio was fine
 (ducks)"
I know but I didn’t expect this story promoting segregation and not being good enough bc of where you come from.
I also enjoyed Aladdin and Beauty and the Beast. My LO likes “the real Lion King” which I enjoy until Beyoncé comes in and Beyoncés all over the music. (Probably an unpopular opinion)
"Poor unfortunate thetans, in pain, in need…"
"If they’re making Ariel black they should have committed to the bit and made Ursula black too. Would have made sense and maybe served to quell all the folks fussing about the race swap cause it wouldn’t just be one, it’d be everybody. For me, personally, she doesn’t feel like Ariel. I don’t have an issue with the casting, per se, but in my head it’s too much of a change up. Ultimately it doesn’t matter cause I probably won’t see it. I watched Aladdin and was so disappointed I swore off all the live remakes."
That would have been perfect and amazing. Can Melissa McCarthy even sing?
They probably tried that and learned that it made her skin look too orange in contrast.
My blind what
"Friend, I can't even get my child to sit through the original.  He is all about Raya and the Last Dragon though.  LOL.  But this is obviously just my experience.  He's still young and definitely prefers animated movies now, but maybe he'll be into these remakes when he's a bit older."
You might be right. Maybe the target audience is in the tween age range (the age watching live action shows on Disney and Nickolodean). I have a younger child (6 years old) and he couldn't care less about the live action remakes.  He's definitely only into animated movies and shows right now.
"Funny you mention that, I tried watching that last night and feel asleep after a half hour. I'm 36. My kids, 6 and 8, liked it though"
Same. We just tried watching this one tonight and he was not interested.
"I mean, I’m sure they are meant for kids, but I don’t disagree with the person you’re responding to entirely. I think that they’re targeting kids AND nostalgic adults — not just kids. And I think the adults care more about them than kids do. 

I literally work with kids and none of them have a live action Disney movie as one of their favorites. They’re into animated movies like Frozen or into animes or into family franchises like Star Wars. The live action Disney movies are too … I’m not sure ‘dour’ is the right word, but they don’t seem to appeal to kids much. Again, I have yet to meet a child who obsesses over one of the live action Disney movies the way they’d obsess over Frozen or Dragonball Z or even some of the original Disney princesses. They’re not necessarily bad movies and kids can watch and enjoy them, but they don’t seem to have much of a long term, strong appeal to kids."
"And Star Wars, Star Trek, Marvel, DC, Rick & Morty, the Matrix, Battlestar Gallactica, Stranger Things, Jurassic Park, The Boys, South Park, and the office. But never Disney. That’s baby shit."
More like Ring of Power these days
Did she get picked to play Ariel?
"If she’s playing Ariel, then that’s bad casting. If she’s playing mulan then that’s bad casting. If she’s playing jasmine then that’s bad casting. If she’s playing fucking prince charming then that’s also bad casting. These are just physical facts. Don’t get triggered"
"Considering the primary audience for these movies is children, I think it's okay for them to exist. 

Until Disney+, Disney was pretty cagey about giving access to their classic films in home media offerings, and they aren't typically in the business of re-releasing them in theaters. So with that being said, there's not much harm in giving parents and kids the opportunity to see a modern interpretation in the theaters."
"So I generally share the same sentiments against capitalism, but how exactly is remaking cartoons into live action movies taking advantage of people???"
Money says otherwise
The Jungle Book was pretty good
The remakes are needed to maintain like trademark usage or something iirc. Its why you see #3 and 4s in some dead series. It's to check the box that its still in use.
How?
I remember Jordan Peele taking about wanting to do it.
Another comment on this post says that the CGI is still rough and will be improved in the coming months. One can hope.
"The original is from the Brothers Grimm.  Adaptations of African fairytales are great, Kirikou and the Sorceress is a beautiful animated film from France.  I have black nieces who are obsessed with Disney Princesses like most girls their age, anytime a Disney Princess movie is made with someone who looks like them I see that as a positive because there are so few of them."
"Yeah, I'm with this guy. Count me in on the suicide pact my dude."
At this point is it closeted? Maybe because they’re on the internet they can pretend it’s not their real life?
That's the thing. Theyre fairytales. There's something transcendent about them. They’ve been told and retold depending on the culture or country. Cinderella started off as an Egyptian myth. Beauty and the Beast has its roots in the myth of Eros and Psyche. Many cultures have borrowed stories from each other and modified them and put their own stamp on them. So if Beauty and the Beast is a valid retelling of a myth why can't modern retellings also be valid?
I don't think they are closeted racist. They are just out and loud about it these days.
Where did she go?
"You’re good bro, not directed at you just meant to comment on the thread. Just been seeing this type of thing a lot lately"
"i feel like maybe because kids don't care that much about those things and Disney is literally marketed to children no matter what other generations follow
but i could be wrong"
It didn’t look *that* bad and the focal point is her voice/character introduction. They’re on an advertising schedule that is working ahead of when cgi will be completed. Nbd
Agree with Will Smith. He was good as Genie. Jasmine was indeed weird. I felt like they tried too hard to make her seem like a strong female role model and forgot to actually *show* her being a strong female role model.
"A ton of stuff bad and different with Mulan compared to those other two, but it was the first mainsteam Wuxia film since Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon in 2000. So as a fan of Asian action cinema I was glad the genre got some exposure."
"I can make you a prince,  or I can MAKE you a prince

""Yall seen my castle?!"""
What?
I'll be honest that made me laugh.
There was a Little Mermaid live show a few years ago that played on ABC and in that Ursula was played by Queen Latifah and I thought she did a great job. They should have asked her to reprise the role here
Everything will be autotuned to death in this.
"I was thinking about how much Rihanna rocked her red hair during whatever phase that was, Rudeboy? But they have different skin tones and it might not have worked."
You're assuming that most kids are into the same things as yours. Don't be silly.
"Out of curiosity, would he care to watch the animated version of little mermaid? Or any of the animated 2-D Disney movies from before he was born? 

As a kid the only ones I liked from before I was born was Beauty and the Beast and Aladdin, which was like a year before. Any movies older I didn’t really care although I did watch Peter Pan at least a few times, but the older the art forms the less I was engaged with the movies. But I was interested in live remakes - like the Pinocchio movie with the kid from Home Improvement. And the Brandi/Whitney Houston Cinderella. And even the 200-whenever adaption of Peter Pan (which, I don’t think is good, but I was interested in it anyway)."
Idk i havent met a kid thats said they’d prefer watching the original animated movie over the live action remake. I was counseling a summer camp and all the kids groaned as I forced them to watch the animated Aladdin as opposed to the live action one
"No, I'm allowed to still be upset about whatever tf that 'pale orc' bullshit was"
"How is playing Ariel bad casting and a physical fact? The character isn’t real and isn’t ethnically tied to anything. She’s a mythical creature that lives in the ocean. Mulan is a based on a Chinese legend, so a non-Chinese actress would be weird. Aladdin is an Arabian location, so it’d be strange for a black actress to play her. If she was cast as “Prince Charming” and referred to as a male, rather than a specified gender swap where they reworked it to be a “Princess Charming” figure, yeah, that’d be weird.

But the little mermaid is… a mermaid. If anything maybe her skin could be green since she’s a mythical creature. Disney characters often defaulted to white unless they told a story specifically set somewhere of a different culture or was a character of a specific race. Ariel as a character can physically be whatever race/ethnicity for the story. Being non-white doesn’t change her story as a mermaid who becomes human."
"> Don’t get triggered

You have written like 5 paragraphs about a movie for children, but *I'm* triggered?

Regardless, please get it out of your system *here* rather than harassing the filmmakers."
How is this bad casting exactly?
"What the fuck? No they weren't, they sold VHS' of all of their animated movies at the time."
"It’s taking advantage of the nostalgia built around these characters. Films like Aladdin, Lion King, Beauty and the Beast, etc. all have fan bases.

They’re repackaging last weeks meal and trying to pass it off as gmo-organic-cage free nonsense when we all know they’re going to butcher it just like the last live actions.

If that doesn’t make sense then what I’m saying, in conclusion, is that they’re taking advantage of childhood favorites by “updating” then when no one wanted or asked for them in the first place- just to make $$ on memories.

Edit: words"
Loot boxes and micro transactions in games make a ton of money. They aren’t good tho
Yeah. Make so it looks like she actually in the water and burn that wig.
"I looked at it. I still fill that there are notable differences. The plots are similar but the stories completely different from what I understand.















Disney literally took the little mermaid and made her black. I just want to see more original stories from Disney when it comes to black people. 

















Sure a kid you love just seeing someone who looks at you. I love to see it. But as you get older, you start to notice little stuff.  For instance, just recently making more diverse Disney princess movies that are original. 


















And what about indengenious representation. Pocahontas ain't cutting it. Peter Pan is horribly prejeduice against Native Americans. 


















I'm sorry, I can't support this adaption. For this reason and the others listed."
"Alot of these assholes won't voice their true opinions in public, that's why I view it as closeted. Any asshole can hide behind a fake page and say what they really feel nowadays."
To me they're closeted because a lot of them are hiding behind keyboards and complaining about something as small as a kids cartoon. Say what you really mean under your real name and then we can see how bold you really are.
That's fair
"I mean, it was like an 80 second clip with 10 seconds of her voice at the end. The focal point was the design of the underwater area"
"Fair point, it was hard to beat the original and likely an unfair comparison.  Terrible decision to not do music and love interest or mushu"
Man Nevermind. I can’t read and only edited to change this whole comment. Don’t mind me. I didn’t know there was ever a live show. I only remember a 90s cartoon
"I'm definitely thinking about younger kids (based on my personal experience) and forgetting tweens and such.  So, I could be wrong.  But I do still think it's true that Disney is relying on nostalgia, to *some* degree with these remakes."
"I grew up on *all* the Disney movies, including the animated ones made before I was born.  Even as a small child in the late 80s and 90s, I *loved* Cinderella, Alice in Wonderland and Peter Pan, for example.  But my son *definitely* has a bias against the older movies!  There are some that he loves, like Lilo and Stitch, but generally the 2-D animation looks older to him and he's not that interested. He's not a big fan of the original Little Mermaid or any of the ""Disney Renaissance"" era movies, but he loves all the newer movies: Big Hero 6, Encanto, Raya, Frozen, etc."
That CGI was indeed unforgivable
"Listen, don’t even get me started on the GOPRO SHOT THEY USED in the barrel scene. After they filmed the whole movie with 2 RED cameras for 3D using a special mirror system to get the distance right. A GOPRO????? 

Sorry I got started"
You’re being ignorant and naive on purpose so I won’t entertain it. I explained way too clearly and simply for you to be confused. You can reread again if that helps you think faster
"Yes, but they often put them ""in the vault"" for long periods of time."
"""Taking advantage of nostalgia""????  What does that even mean? LMAO. No one is forcing you to spend money to go see the movies. 

Plus, you are aware that most Disney movies are not original content right?  They are based on older stories, so your argument doesn't make any sense.  Their classic animations were already “updated” stories."
Literally never talked about good or bad. The statement was that it is not working out for them when it clearly is
"When you think about it, hair is just a liability underwater. A mermaid should be smooth like a dolphin."
but you're totally right in the sense that why release something If it's half-assed
"It was just a one-off event, not a series. I just meant that I agreed with you."
If you're not making an assumption then how do you figure?
"I think when used to newer animated styles, the old ones look… quite old haha. Maybe he’ll like the old 2-d ones someday, maybe even the live action. To me, The live-action movies and remakes, at least allows today’s kids to have another option of exposure to the stories and kinds of characters many of us appreciated when we were younger. And in general, I feel like some changes in characters, whether simple casting or changes in dialogue and behavior, prevents watching something that could be a shot-for-shot remake. If it’s a fresh new take, I don’t need or care to see a live carbon copy of an old movie. ~$10 or whatever per person just to watch the same thing with nothing new besides no animations seems like a waste of money"
"The pale ork thing just really set me off because they basically used him as an excuse to draw out the series.

But at the same time they extended one children's book into 3 movies, added a bunch of extra bullshit, and still missed a ton of scenes from the book somehow"
You… didn’t explain shit
You didn’t explain. So I am going to assume the worst as if it wasn’t that you would have explained.
I never said you did
"True or give her some sea kelp or some such as hair. That would work much better. You know like the mermaid art on pinterest.









Listen they could do a black take on the little mermaid but make change the plot a little. Make it different and original. Or do a more realistic take that wouldn't scare the children. Although if kids can watch Princess and the Frog and not be traumatized then they should be fine."
I second this
I third this

"800M-1B imo. GA does NOT care about VFX, they will eat this up like almost all the other live action Disney remakes."
"Remember when Aladdin’s trailer came out and everyone hated how Smith’s genie looked? Yeah, Disney’s marketing for these movies looks bad to us but they end up appealing heavily to the GA."
"I want to like it, I really do. I think a lot of it actually looked really good, albeit cheesy. But I know it's just a trailer, and these trailers end up making the movie seem a lot better than it ends up being (I think of Mulan and Pinocchio which had great trailers as well). Where credit is due, the acting looks good. 

Maybe I'll go see it. The Little Mermaid and it's home video sequel and prequel were some of my favorites growing up."
At least they made her hair brighter. I love the animated little mermaid but this movie just ain't for me. Not a terrible trailer for kids and young families though.
"Is it me or does Ariel’s acting seem a little too stilted and choppy? Ursula looks pretty good though.

Overall, this should end at the higher end of Disney remake grosses, maybe a little below Aladdin."
"This looks really bad, it will make at least $800 million."
"One of the problems with having overworked VFX teams is that they have to hide the small flaws in their CGI, and one way to do that is to make everything dark. The vibrant colors of the cartoon are gone. The palette is all dreary. This does not look like a movie that would appeal to children. It looks bad."
This movie will need to perform without the entire Asia market. Good luck.
"Summer 2023 is MASSIVELY crowded. But this is probably being underpredicted. I don’t see it making $1B, but it should do well, and might give Spider-Verse some tough competition for #1 on that first weekend in June"
Halle and her singing is beautiful but other than that this is just not doing it for me
"I think this will be the biggest wild card for 2023 box office.

For me, I’m expecting 700 million to 1 billion."
"I think the movie is gonna do well, is just not for me. I haven't even seen the original and I have no intention of it anytime now. Assuming GA likes it then it's a billion dollar film. GA loves these Disney live actions. Still salty that they had to fuck up Mulan so bad, the only film I was asking for a 1 to 1 remake and they had to fuck that one up."
"Gonna remind everyone that this subreddit is usually wrong about trailers.

See Aladdin and Venom."
"I’m not seeing $1B for this because I think Disney has alienated some of their audience. However, I think it will be a lot bigger than I initially thought (I had it on par with the first Maleficent), in the $775-850M worldwide range, but it will be more domestic heavy than int’l, similar to both Black Panther movies."
"I think the movie will be good, but the visual effects are a little… cheesy? Still think this has a shot at a billion, especially if the music sounds great"
This movie better wishes upon a star to pull off an Aladdin upset because this is still not it.
"600 ww I think, half of it from US."
At least it looks a lot more colourful than the first trailer did.
It was super annoying when the Oscars stopped everything to hype this trailer up
"Despite reddits vitriol, it's making a billion. Kids and families are there for the name, so as long as what they recognize from the original is here, which is the music, they will show up"
Don't get me wrong Halle Bailey has a lovely voice and can sing...but that's not Ariel and I don't think this film is going to do well at the box office.
My 6 year niece having grown up on the cartoon watched the trailer and asked …. “Mommy where’s Ariel?”
I don’t expect many kids under 7-8 to see this based on this trailer.
If this has a budget over 200M then that will be truly embarrassing like JL level embarrassing because the cgi looks way too cheap to be 200M or over
"Yeah, this isn't hitting a billion."
Should do around 600 - 750 M
I hope it flops but I doubt it will
Really excited for this movie. I don't even know why besides the fact that I love musicals. But man can't wait to see it in theaters
"600m ww because of the brand, but i doubt it'll be good."
This isn’t coming close to a billion.
This could hit $1B. The general audience is not in any way similar to redditors.
"Arielle is serving so hard vocally. Worth the ticket for that, imo"
"Can y’all chill out about the VFX? Like damn you go try and do VFX and see how hard it is. Not every movie is gonna look like mf Avatar damnit…

Anyways, imma say:

$116.1M OW

$423.7M DOM

$643M OS

$1.067B WW"
One billion confirmed.
"The movies look more colorful than expected, but if this film is a crowdpleasing hit then Transformers and Spider-Verse should be worried they could get mixed up in the family market especially Spider-Verse as both movies have black protagonist and in somewhat targeting black families."
Halle is the only thing that interests me. I think her design is great and that tail is amazingly done. The underwater effects don’t look too bad. Can’t wait!
"Alright, consider me a frickin' believer now.  This has been happening a lot this year.  First, Flash, then Indy, and now this.  Gonna be a great year for blockbusters, and I think this one might just earn a billion worldwide.  To hell with the racists and the Disney boycotters.  This is gonna dominate."
This movie is gonna do 1b and I sense there’s gonna be a lot of deleted comments
"I'm giving my official prediction. This movie will not gross over 800 Million.
I honestly struggle to see it even reaching 750 Million.

This just looks like any other generic Disney live action remake with non of the colors or liveliness of the animated movie.
The visuals are okay at best.
And from the trailer atleast, Halle Bailey did not impress.(They could have gotten an actress with a tad bit more acting experience).

And before people start making accusations, I have no problem with the casting just Disney half assing these live action remakes. 

And I know people like to bring up the other Disney live action remakes that made money. But if an Alladin movie with Will Smith in 2019(Pre-Covid/Peak Disney) struggled to make a Billion dollars. 
I don't think this movie has chance in hell of making it. 

I see this movie making anywhere between 650 Million to 750 Million. 
Not a flop like some are predicting but definitely not the super success that most are predicting."
1B is definitely on the table fs fs
"This could be this years Lightyear.

These live remakes have been going straight  to Disney+ since the pandemic started, similar to the Pixar films and this is the first one post pandemic not going straight to Disney+, just like Lightyear was. 

I have a feeling audiences will just wait the 30-45 days for it to hit Disney+."
Will it profit?I suspect a flop but who knows
"Looks great. I hope it makes 1 B+, then another billion for all the piss-babies mad about black Ariel.

The only thing I don't like is the hyper realistic animal sidekicks. Creep me out."
"It looks like shit because Disney is handing over these movie to talentless directors. But that's pretty much irrelevant for the performance of these remakes at boxoffice 

There's no between with This movie, it is going to either be a huge hit or flop pretty badly at boxoffice 

The original little mermaid wasn't that successful, it was the worst performance out of Disney Renaissance movies at boxoffice and the story wasn't good either, so there's a very good case that it might outright bomb at boxoffice 

In the other hand, the power of nostalgia is strong and the casting might also make the movie overperform in the domestic market hence becoming a huge hit worldwide"
"Looks good, not for me though"
"I don't know if i have enough money to watch all the things that are coming this year, this year is packed."
It's looking much better than I expected. Another massive hit from Disney.
"I do wish Ariel's hair was more red, and the design of Sebastian doesn't look great, but I will say this trailer looks quite a bit better than the past ones."
"Looks awful, pretty sure this will go straight to dvd, not even Blu-ray or streaming, like just Redbox."
This movie is going to flop badly.
This will not do very well at the box office.
"Putting aside my personal opinions, I think that this is going to make a lot of money. There's nothing in particular going against it aside from some astroturfed controversy about the race swapping. Spider-Verse 2 may steal some of TLM's thunder but I think it'll be fine if families respond well to the film. I think that Disney has a winner on their hands with this... They've certainly done worse than this and gotten stellar results (Lion King 2019)."
"All over the Internet I see this getting ratioed right now, but it’s probably going to perform above most expectations. It’s guaranteed to be among this summer’s top five global grossers, and (maybe?) if luck is on it’s side, it’ll make that top 3."
Wth? My comment was removed for being positive about the trailer? The movie looks like… The Little Mermaid. I think it’ll be fun. The trailer is solid.
"21 upvotes to 160 comments...yeah this thread isn't going to be good.

The movie looks good to me. I'll be taking my niece to see it."
"Unless this movie has a banger of a score, it's going to do much much worse than the other adaptation."
Just like all the previous Disney films they are the same exact thing I don’t see the appeal. And doubt it’s gonna hit a billion.
"$800-900M. It would have likely crossed $1B before Disney+ and COVID but there are a lot of people that went to the theater to check out Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, and The Lion King that will likely wait for it to come out on Disney+."
"I will watch this it's looking good and because I watched the animated one when I was a child ,hope the story is good because Mulan story was piece of garbage"
"don't think a lock for billion anymore, but little girls  are easy to impress"
"Out of all the trailers/teasers they put out, this one is definitely the best. And Halle looks engaging. CGI is still very wonky."
"How was my topic about her CGI removed for being ""off topic"" when there's so many others commenting on the appearance too?"
$1.28bn mark me down
"The movie looks bad; the vfx, the dull looking colors, and the lighting are too troublesome to overlook for most when it comes to quality. I know that kids won’t really care about all of those factors, but the lack of vibrant colors and expressive characters & animation will. This doesn’t seem exciting and captivating enough to grab a kids attention. 

Ursula looks great and it seems that Melissa really will deliver. Halle’s voice is also a stand out, but can those two potentially bring in the numbers? It’s tough to predict, but 1 billion is definitely in its grasp. 

I think once we get another trailer and we get closer to release, we will have a better judgement."
That’s what I don’t get. We already went through this with Aladdin. It clearly isn’t going to flop. The 90s nostalgia is too strong.
Sebastián looks and sounds terrible.
"Disney knows this. I have submitted to a future of lazy remakes because it doesn’t matter in the end, audiences will be there"
"All other disney live action remakes that came out pre pandemic and pre disney plus launch 
This is gonna struggle hard"
Unfortunately the GA will eat up anything which lets Disney to stay on low quality bs
"Reasons they will eat it up: Nostalgia, following the plot almost closely, has all the songs intact, and probably the big one: Halle Bailey's performance as Ariel and her magical voice. Literal chills every time the previews show her singing ""Part of Your World."""
"Phase 1 - Thousands of people angrily screaming ""Who asked for this?!""

Phase 2- it ends up making a billion dollars

Phase 3- ""Th-that doesn't make it **good!**""; ignoring the original question"
Exactly what I was thinking. Yeah the effects are shit compared to Way of Water but so are pretty much every movie ever. I could absolutely see general audiences eating this shit up
"This subreddit and the movies subreddit and pretty much all Reddit has a high hatred for Disney live action films.

Look at this post. It's at 50% up voted lmao...

Just saw the trailer and this looks like a solid billion dollar movie for me."
It’s the same boring cycle. People call these movies bad looking and then they have pikachu faces when they make a good amount of profit.
Definitely. There isn’t much Disney could do to suddenly make my kids NOT want to see this.
That was my impression as well but it is a little hard to tell with just a few lines of dialogue.
i agree with ur point but people still flocked to black panther and its sequel though
It’s 2023 and y’all still think spider verse is like avatar where it’ll be a huge threat or even competition to other movies. Come on now…
Summer isn't that massively crowded for family films though.
"Both will be big, but if it performs like Aladdin, SpiderVerse should be comfortably number 1 that weekend."
"I hope she's able to get a long career off the back of her performance, but I also hope the rest of the movie is a disaster so we stop getting these lazy remakes."
"I can understand this reaction, but it just won't matter ultimately.  People are gonna flock to it."
But it’s a remake to an old film everyone knows. Film quality doesn’t matter with these remakes because we already know the story is good. It’s all about the visuals and music that matter.

Avatar cost way too much to produce. It would be financial suicide to increase the budget that much in order to make the water CGI quality the same as avatar 2
">but that's not Ariel

Because she's not white?"
Interesting
"This comment made me think about what the target demography is. It seems like a type of movie that children will find boring and adults will find too childish.

&#x200B;

It's a straight-to-tv type of movie for backround watching for me, personally."
I can see the budget being $150 million. It would only be $200 million for the inclusion of COVID protocols.
"""Not everything does. Not everything has to."""
It could because disney plus is there and if wom is on the level of lion king or alladin live action audiences will skip it for streaming
600M is gonna be a hard pull with disney plus and the competition at hand
"The general audience is NEVER redditors, or twitter people, or the kind of people who obsess over the number of dislikes a video gets.

We have to keep learning this lesson, the internet is not the real world."
"You're right. Not every movie has to look like Avatar.
You can also look like The Jungle Book.
I keep forgetting which studio made that movie."
Dude this movie is like 95% VFX and it probably has a budget of 200M or maybe more depending on how the covid tax affected the production we have to criticize the VFX here otherwise you'll expect more shitty looking expensive movies like this
"I agree! We shouldn’t be that hard on TLM! After all, it’s produced by small indie company named Disney!"
Nope. $400M WW. Will do worse than Ant-Man.
"Yep. Right along the same folks who said avatar 2 would flop.

I know right lmao.

Can also say incoming simpletons trashing the movie for no good reason."
Angry neck beards are not the movie’s audience. Nobody in the real world cares about being “ratioed.”
Angry boys online are not the movie’s audience.
It will have the beloved songs from the original.
"Alan Menken is back to do the score and every song from the original will be there, along with four new ones written by Menken and Lin-Manuel Miranda."
But the “same exact thing” carried those previous films to a billion. Why wouldn’t this one? The formula works. Even if we don’t like it.
But disney plus is right there and this doesn't scream must see in cinemas with the way it looks
"This is a subreddit about box office discussion, your opinion about a girls voice is meaningless here."
"According to the box office of these films, everyone."
Eh I like seeing these
"There's a big difference between 2019's market and today.


Before the Pandemic, audiences were much more open to going to the cinemas to see any movie that was mildly entertaining.
Audiences now have become much more selective.
Also Disney had much more goodwill back then.

Marvel movies used to be sure shot super successes back then but clearly that's not the case now."
The Lion King music and movie was a massive let down and that movie was still huge. Just from the little tease of the music we've had so far I'm going to say the music is going to be quite good. So it has that going for it.
"And so it goes, round and round."
"The effects are weird, but not shit. It outright looks like people filmed in open air as if to look like they're under water, and it results in a sort of uncanny valley/surrealist sort of vibe. That's not exactly a new quality to this property. I mean, we had the same questions of the cartoon film like ""where the f are all those bubbles coming from underwater every time someone swims around?"" It's weird, but it worked before."
"They absolutely will. This looks like complete dogshit, and the animal sidekicks are uncanny as fuck (which literally defeats the purpose of including them). But as long as families are okay with it, then it has a clear path to success"
"Oh, don't worry, they will."
Idk about this making a billion at all lol
"I don’t get it. This film follows the same formula as BatB, TLK, and Aladdin in being almost the same thing.

That is exactly what the GA wants. 

Literally it just has to be not an outright disaster (and some would argue TLK was and look at that..) and it’ll make a ton"
"by this point I doubt people think these movies won't make money, still look terrible though"
"Well, I've been converted.  This is gonna get a billion dollars, and I was one of the early naysayers."

"You mean aladdin, the movie that made a billion?"
There are plenty of kids/teens that don't grow up with the original animated TLM.
"I never bitched about TLK so not sure what you mean about that. To me, the trailer looked distractingly cheesy, not lovably cheesy."
"Hey dear, it may be shocking to hear but there's this phrase that goes ""properly executed implementation of stylization.""

TLK lacked any sort of inspired visual style.

This looks like it lacks budget.

Both are missing the point."
"The only reason people were mad about the Lion King effects is that they didn't give the animals proper expressions, because the director wanted it to be like ""a nature documentary"". Ignoring the fact that lions can emote plenty in real life and they did great with Aslan 15 years prior. All they had to do was make them like Aslan and it could have been great.

The background CGI was good, it was the character CGI that was the issue."
Nobody cares about Spiderverse and Transformers (and even The Flash I'd say).
"The soundtrack for TLM comes out May 19, Disney confirmed, so that should help build up attendance and boost ticket sales."
"Ariel is established character, everyone knows who Ariel is and everyone will tell you that's not her. There a reason why Lightyear bombed at the box office and it wasn't same sex scene."
Why would kids find this boring?
"Its a live action of Disney animations they typically go up to 200M and beyond  before tax rebates eg beauty and the beast, mulan, the lion king so its that far of a stretch excluding covid stuff"
The majority of people here are claiming that it is going simply because its another live action of their fariy tales
You mean aladdin and lion king which both made a billion at the box office? Those movies?
"Right. And here's some proof: the just released ""Halle Bailey as Ariel"" doll has sold out on online retailers."
You can't be serious....
You can hate on it without looking like you know nothing about the box office. You chose... not to.
Yup and its worth noting that those movies pose more threat to LMM than the competition did to TLK and BATB did during their release windows
"The only film on that list that is competition is indiana jones in June. 

In fact, its going to be hilarious to see the “beloved online fave” spiderverse get curb stomped by a mermaid. Oh the little boys, they never learn."
Actually yes. Pinocchio is a partial musical.
"do you guys forget about Nutcracker, christopher robin, Mulan etc? for every successful disney remake there are 2 others which flop"
The backlash from the casting on this one is gonna hurt the numbers. I don’t care either way.
"The formula barely dragged Alladin across the Billion dollar.
And that movie had Will Smith in it. And that movie was released in 2019 before the Pandemic when Disney was at it's peak.

The Little Mermaid is less popular than Alladin.
Has no big name star like Will Smith.
Is coming out post pandemic when the audiences are way more selective.
And is coming out at a time when Disney movies are very clearly not making what they did pre pandemic.

It's not going to flop but it's not going to cross the Billion dollar mark just because of the formula"
"It's LMM, it's guaranteed to be great. He doesn't really miss lol"
I don’t think they’re bad it’s just everyone keeps comparing it to Way of Water because of you know water but that movie looks so good it makes almost everything else look bad in comparison
"The same formula that made Pinocchio, Dumbo and Mulan huge hits, right?"
You do realize all those movies you listed was pre-pandemic and also pre-disney plus launch right? The market simply isn't the same anymore since those movies
"Spoiler. A lot of the hatred comes from people being angry that Ariel is black. Not that those people would ever admit.

This looks no worse than any other Disney live action and i have no doubt that it will play well in theaters."
"Exactly. We all know that the formula works.

Even the formula for MCU works, it's just that we've gotten so much more of that compared to these musical live Action films"
People project their own personal preferences and confuse them for reasonable predictions. People thought Aladdin would flop because “it looked bad.” Well…
"It has the Perfect formula for a billion dollars.

It's a Disney Musical, people LOVE Disney Musicals.

It has Disney Renessannce one at that too, bringing those who grew up with it too.

It's the first black actress to be lead a live action Disney musical, you'll get people supporting just because of that.

It's a fantasy type film, general audiences love being taken out of their real world into something fantasy.

LMM is writing new songs for it."
"Usually you can tell the percentage. Look at how many upvotes the post has compared to comments.

If it has more comments then usually the thread is pretty bad...like this one."
lmao yeah i dont see a lot of asian people excited for this film (source: i’m asian and live in asia) but this will definitely do well domestically. lots of black americans and left leaning people who want to see diversity are excited to see it
Elemental coming out the same day as Flash 💀
"I'm talking family films though.

Next one would be Elemental.

Spider-verse and Transformers are more niche now with the respective fandom.

Flash will be good competition but if you're bringing your kids, you'll take them to see TLM or Elemental instead, same with Indiana Jones"
"I think the only movie that will unseed Mermaid is The Flash.

Spider verse is niche and so is Transformers...well that IP was kinda killed by Michael Bay."
"Aladdin made $42 million in weekend 2 domestically, I'd be shocked if SpiderVerse opened below $50 million."
 But their parents did
"Born in 1999, never watched The Little Mermaid, and I don’t really plan to in the future lol"
"It's supposed to look that cheesy!!

Maybe you don't see it but I definitely do.

It's just supposed to be a fun musical live action film."
"Lmao if it looked like it didn't lack budget, yall would bitch about something else."
Aslan wasn't really emoting like real lions. They don't do that in real life.
"Spiderverse made 400M and has only gotten more popular since it made it online. 

To say no one cares is plain wrong. 

People care for transformers. Make it a good movie and people will easily watch it. 

Spiderverse easily seems like another 400M + grosser

Transformer can easily make over 500M if it’s good. That’s good competition.

And come on dude. Even if the flash movie was the worst movie ever, it will easily make 400M especially with the hype of 2 Batman + super girl and then flash.  If the movie is really good, it can easily make 700-800M +"
You have to be living under a rock to say no one cares about spider-verse 💀
"Just personal experience as a parent who watch children movies with my kids, I have a grasp of the quality of Disney live-action movies. Here, I'll make a list for visual aid of live-action disney movies neither me or my children enjoy.

&#x200B;

CINDERELLA (2015), MULAN (2020), BEAUTY AND THE BEAST (2017), ALADDIN (2019), MALEFICENT (2014), THE LION KING (2019), ALICE IN WONDERLAND (2010), DUMBO (2019), ALICE THROUGH THE LOOKING GLASS (2016), PINOCCHIO (2022).

&#x200B;

Now there is one exception. THE JUNGLE BOOK (2016). Even if I don't enjoy a children movie, sitting with my children who does makes me able to watch through it.  

And I specifically only mean the live-action Disney movies here, we still re-watch the classic and newer animated movies quite regularly.

To sum it all up: Have you seen the Aladdin live-action??"
Ya those movies which came out before disney plus launched and before the pandemic
Buh buh buh neckbeards disliked a video!
100%
"You’re right. I have no clue what I’m talking about: https://www.reddit.com/r/boxoffice/comments/114rfsr/after_huge_175m_thu_previews_at_us_boxoffice/j8yipy0/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3

And I’ll admit, I’m mostly exaggerating. It’ll do better than that, but truly I don’t believe it’ll finish much better than $600M WW.

My actual prediction would be $550M-$610M. Zero way this thing hits a billion. Especially with actual competition this Spring/Summer."
Barely. It's not labeled musical..
"Mulan didn’t even release in the US, and came out on Disney+. The Nutcracker isn’t a remake, and neither is Christopher Robin."
"The Nutcracker never was a 2D Disney Rennaisance musical, Christopher Robin was a sequel more than a direct adaptation, and Mulan was more like a take on the ballad than an adaptation of the Disney version people actually liked and were hoping for."
Im suprised you remember the nutcracker tbh
Backlash is vocal minority.
No it isn't. It's absolutely free marketing.
Fine but you’re still wrong that no one wants to see these movies.
No reason to call people idiots for something so innocuous.
"Dumbo was quite different from the original, Pinocchio released straight to Disney+, and Mulan didn’t get a proper release because it was supposed to come out in March 2020 (you know when the pandemic started). Also, Dumbo and Pinocchio were not renaissance movies.

Bad examples."
None of those are musicals so they literally don't fit the formula.
The only live-action adaptation to come out in theaters since the start of the pandemic was Cruella which did well for it’s circumstances.
"Yeah the look of it reminds me of aladdin live action. 

The real issue with this movie is that the original little mermaid wasn't that successful to begin with, it's the lowest grossing of Disney Renaissance and it's not going to play well in some regions because of the casting 

Either way I'm very curious to see how this one will perform at boxoffice"
"And guess who's directing it: Rob Marshall, who is no stranger to the billion dollar club with the fourth Pirates of the Caribbean film. And this is his third movie musical for Disney after Into the Woods and Mary Poppins Returns."
"Transformer is a family movie. As long as it is good, the movie is a competition"
"all of them are family movies, Superhero movies aside from R-rated and something like batman are geared towards families, so is transformers, elementals, Indy, spiderverse and Fast X which debuts a week or two before"
"Calling a Spider-Man film, even one without Peter Parker as the main star niche is a bit off"
"The original opened 35M

I’d say the same or 38M."
"I'm born in 1993, never watched any of the Disney films besides Hercules.

I'm a fan of musicals in theaters so I'll always watch these."
Sebastian is terrible.  I didn't even realize it was supposed to be him right away because the damn fake creepy crab didn't look like it was talking.
"Ignoring everything said in a comment that you responded to just makes everyone believe you're trolling.

I _just_ said that there's an alternative way of handling their film production."
"They don't emote to that degree, no, but they emote more than they did in the Lion King film."
What? Cinderella? That movie was the best live action Disney film to date. I saw it whilst at Uni and absolutely loved it.
"Ah, the new excuse."
Bro I'll take what you're having... I mean I'm not saying it's not impossible but it's like 99% not possible.
"1) I dont understand what that ant man 3 prediction has to do with this if im being honest, youre going to have to make the connection for me, im sorry.

2) i think thats far too low. The other live action remakes have made bank and 1b, so id assume that would have been the data point used. Not ant man 3 ? Youll want to compare it to similar movies/genre. Ant man 3 isnt as close as, say aladdin, BATB, TLk, etc."
well see at the box office when it releases. like i said i could care less since i aint even watching it but i am interested how it performs. My prediction its not gonna get 1B WW. DOM 450M
"I said no one asked for it, not that no one would see it."
Right. Mulan didn't even have Mushu
And if anything Mulan was more an adaptation of the original ballad and less an adaption of the Disney film.
cruella didn't have the competition that little mermaid is going up against so thats a big factor to look out for
People tend to forget that The Little Mermaid was the first movie in the Disney Renaissance. While i don't doubt that its not as popular as some of the other IP's it was also the first to test the waters so it likely didn't play to its full potential.
"Its a beast wars movie, thats niche as fuck."
I mean is it really? You're not taking your family of 2 kids with the wife and one daughter to that over TLM.
"The first one didn't even make 400m. It's pretty niche film targeted to Spiderman animation fans, not GA."
"It was a Christmas release with a 5.4× multiplier, and exploded on home video and streaming after it won Best Animated Feature. Spider-Man and Miles himself have only become more popular since it opened. I'm not saying it'll make as much as The Little Mermaid overall, but it'll definitely open way bigger than the original opened with. It won't have a 5.4× multiplier again, but it will have a bigger opening and total gross than the original."
It's not that terrible. Look at Charlotte's Web.
They really don't.
Its not an excuse these things did not exist in summer 2019 when these films came out so now you have a huge variable for TLM box office gross where moviegoers are gonna say wait til streaming if the wom isn't good enough
"I’m mostly exaggerating haha. My actual prediction is $550M-$610M. 

Just look at my Ant-Man prediction: https://www.reddit.com/r/boxoffice/comments/114rfsr/after_huge_175m_thu_previews_at_us_boxoffice/j8yipy0/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3"
" Not every live action remake hits a Billion... Dumbo made 300M, and Alice 2 made about 280M. Along with that, Mulan, Lady and the Tramp, and Pinnochio were all poorly received on D+. I don't think TLM will bomb, but 600M seems about right"
No one asks for pretty much all movies though.
"If people see it its because they wanted it and thus asked for it.
Supply, demand."
This is *The Little Mermaid* lol not some random movie like Pete’s Dragon. Come on now
"I don't think the first to test water is as of a big hurdle to overcome in 1989 as people are making it out to be because back then originals were dominating the top 10 highest grossing list anyway and movies stayed in the theater longer 

I think the real problem is that story of the movie isn't good compared to the little king, aladdin or batb"
Transformer the name isn’t niche.
"It’s up to the kids. If the kids want to watch transformer, the parents will take them there. The parents aren’t gonna be like you wanna watch transformers? Too bad. We are watching the little mermaid"
"Spider-Verse isn’t niche, I think you’re ignoring how successful it was during and especially after it’s theatrical run."
let's see how the sequel does
"Spiderverse couldnt even outgross the amazing spiderman movies.
Targeting only two quadrants will always limit your box office."
Its 2023. Audiences still like what they like. Plenty of other films are making alot of money. You’re talking like its 2021.
What's your reasoning though
Movie isn’t even out yet… so we don’t know how many people ‘want’ to see it.
"The little mermaid is less popular than either batb, the lion king or aladdin, so other movies have much better odds to make money going up against the little mermaid 

The original little mermaid was the lowest grossing of Disney Renaissance."
And disney plus exists so if the reception isn't steller enough to carry then expect little BO returns
"It's not that. TLM came first. It's literally the only reason.

It was a critically acclaimed film."
"Let's be honest if you have one girl, one boy, with the wife, TLM is getting chosen."
Dude spiderverse is niche. Get out of your online bubble.
Quantumania says otherwise
"Well, all these live action versions make about a billion. It’s a safe bet. But you know better, random internet person?"
">The original little mermaid was the lowest grossing of Disney Renaissance.

That's partially because it was the first film in the lineup."
Lmao it did the lowest because it came out first........
It making less around 30 or so years ago than the others is irrelevant. It’s 2023 and it’s solidified itself as an iconic piece of film with just as much as a cultural impact as Lion king and Aladdin. I don’t get this narrative.
"I fail to see why coming first would have been such a huge problem in 1986 when most movies were originals anyway, no streaming at the time so movies stayed longer in the theater"
what are you being honest about? We don't know shit about what goes on in mind of families when they pick up movies.
"Its 2023, boys can like dolls and girls cars"
"Everyone I know online and in real life are excited for spider-verse. The trailer has 31M views and 900k likes, what kind of people do you talk to?"
"“Eternals says otherwise”
Then the next three MCU movies are in the top ten highest grossing films of 2023.

I mean, thats like declaring the MCU dead after thor the dark world."
Because anything that comes first is usually always going to make less than after.
"TLM has something for everyone, which is my point."
"No shit. 

But TLM has action, princesses, dance, evil villians, etc you'll have something for everyone."
"“Everyone i know.”
Well who could argue with all that polling data?

I’m using the first film’s meh box office as proof."
"Thor 2 was a massive hit that did significantly more than Thor 1 and boasted genuinely good contemporary user reviews across the board (all while not being very good). Coming off of Avengers 1, audiences liked Thor: Dark World because of how much they liked the first Avengers film."
"You do realize Quantumania made less than the first antman movie despite the larger opening weekend right
this isn't a dark world situation where it's just another mid sequel its actually not going to break even and some of this can't be attributed to the disney plus release where audiences just wait to see it there

People were doing this for wakanda forever, love and thunder and multiple of madness so its not a unique thing its kinda a recurring problem here"
"Fair enough, but you have to be ignoring its popularity online and elsewhere. You’re also ignoring its popularity with teenagers."
Thor the dark world is one of the worst films in the MCU. Its hated.
"And the eternals was a clear sign that wakanda forever would not make 800M.
Oh wait….

Also, multiverse of madness made like 900 million.

Clearly, the eternals spelled the end for marvel."
"Its mostly popular with two quadrants. Young and old males. That will never get you on the big side of the box office.

A live action Miles film would be big."
"Use the way back machine on Thor 2's IMDB or Rotten Tomatoes score. Look at the film's cinemascore. Look at the film's box office gross. 

Literally all of the data shows the film was liked on release. It's always been a bad movie but an Avengers halo clouded it and the fact that it's an MCU film meant that people continue to focus on it, driving perception downwards while equally bad or worse films are forgotten about rather than reevaluated in a negative direction.

e.g. Look at this healthy [7.5/10](https://web.archive.org/web/20140209082852/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1981115/) on IMDb and look today and see a 6.8/10 average."
Actually it was love and thunder that spelled the end
"[TheQuorum’s current tracking of Spider-Verse indicates, 81% will pay to see it 19% will wait to stream it for free.](https://thequorum.com/pay/) Unless I’m interpreting this wrong, in that case let me know."
And then wakanda forever bombed…oh wait…
I’ll be honest I dont know how to analyze that data.
"Wakanda forever had the advantage of being made for the black audiences which allowed it to reach way more people outside of the mcu fanbase no doubt it was going to make money 

Quantumania is setting up the villans for the next avengers its a main event and it's not even catching the first antmans BO thats most certainly a huge indicator that the franchise is falling apart 

Now with the main point I was making is that the disney plus release is giving people another option here to just avoid the cinema and it's likely to repeat with TLM as well"
"Honestly, neither do I. Either way Spider-verse is ranked highly."
"Lol more excuses
Buh buh buh"
"Ok then explain to me why so many people will go see TLM in theaters over streaming 

It doesn't have practical effects to wow the audience like top gun does so its not gonna play like top gun maverick 

95% of the movie is CGI and it doesn't even look that good compared to avatar or even the batman so it's not gonna play like either of those 2"
"I'll never understand why they always opt for realistic looking talking animals in their remakes.

They massacred my boys Sebastian and Flounder. :("
"Looking at these, I thought Nicholas Cage was going to be playing King Triton..."
"King Triton: I need you to step out of the sea, sir"
Why do the animals always look scarier in these remakes?
My biggest complaint is everything from the trailers just looks so dead and colorless.  Especially compared to avatar 2.
"Oh, Halle Berry!

*squints*

Oh."
"They’ve turned the cute, lovable Sebastian into pure aquatic nightmare fuel"
All of these posters look like AI generated art that was done on the way to the meeting to present them that started 10 minutes ago.
Flounder and Sebastian look ridiculous.
Those sea creatures are creepily deep in the uncanny valley... They should have either gone all in cartoony or all in realistic.
"Why is everything so dark, even the human characters in the sun have their faces in shadow and Ariel's poster is so dark, you can only make out her face. The animals also seem washed out, have these people seen a coral reef or watched blue planet?

Bring out the color, showcase it, why is this so hard?"
Oh god it looks so bad
Sebastian looks so fucking bad hahahahaha
They went out of their way to make Flounder as ugly as possible
I thought this already happened
Flounder looks like he’s seen God
Scuttle looks like he's about to kill someone with a fork
"Everyone upset with Black Ariel, here I am trying to figure out the casting of Melissa McCarthy as a character inspired by Divine? What was the thought process beyond larger woman = larger woman?"
The Shape of Water sequel is looking good
No thanks.
Everybody hates it. It makes a billion dollars. ^(repeat)
Just fucking no.
I'm a little worried that they learned nothing from their Lion King remake
"Lowkey a little sad they didn't go with a brighter red for her hair. IMO, it would have looked really great on her."
This will be a shit show
"> Awkwafina

Aight im out"
Looks very bland. The movie will be panned down along with some trolls citing it as their win and media/Disney will catch these trolls tweets and claim “The Little Mermaid” was target of trolling and no one will care if it looked bland and disinteresting
Flotsam and Jetsam look cool i guess
Awkwafina? Someone is actually called that??
"I just cannot convince myself this movie isn't fake, like it's like a parody of those shite live action Disney films. It's going to make a billion dollars and people will flock to it but STILL this is maybe the worst trend Hollywood has had film wise in a long time. Next they're going to remake the live action remakes back into animated ones I swear to god."
They didn’t even try to make her look like she’s underwater except for that CGI’d ass hair behind her
"""Excuse me where's the little mermaid theater for 7:30?""

'it's over there, UNDER DA C, UNDER DA C!'"
"wtf are they going for with this movie? What is gained by making this live action? It looks bleak and weird and doesn't seem to improve on the original. Come to think of it, none of these live action Disney movies are improvements. They just seem like shameless cash grabs. Cringey era for Disney."
"Whats the next Disney live action remake of an animated classic going to be? I hope they remake Brave, I've always wanted to see what Scottish people would look like in real life"
"That Flounder scared the fucking shit out of me, i I saw that coming towards me and start talking, I would fucking run!!! (Or swim!)"
"This looks so fucking goofy lol. Ofc it’s probably going to make a bajillion dollars and we’ll have to put up with more of this lazy, brain dead reboot nonsense"
Really bad casting
No
Nothing about this movie that looks remotely interesting to me
"Awkwafina…oh cool so it’ll just be her doing the same thing she’s done for forever 

Also why does Javier look like Nick cage??"
"Read that as Halle Berry at first.

Think she's 56 now, still fine but probably can't pull off playing a teenager."
"Oh my god, the fish one"
"Seriously? They could have made Flounder look waaay better, but instead hes just a regular fish with 3 pixels of yellow."
I REALLY miss the old school Disney vibes. They're ruining every IP they own now and blaming it on the audience. I think the last decent movies trickled out in the mid 2000's.
As soon as awkwafina is involved im fucking hard passing whatever movie it is
At least Eric is still hot.
I am of Danish ancestry and this film is offensive.
"Those hyper realistic animal characters are so fucking awful. Like absolutely fucking terrible. I was never going to watch this because I’m not six years old, but god damnit. Even six year old me would have though this film looks ugly as shit. Fuck Disney for being so god-damn lazy. You have one job Disney. Bring children wonder. This isn’t bottom of the barrel this is underneath the barrel."
Isn't she a little old to be playing a teenager?
"Sebastian is giving me ugly sonic vibes. 

Also, inB4 this thread is locked"
"I won't be watching the movie, but I will be listening to it. Halle has a great voice and its basically more covers of songs I love."
"I like the designs of triton's armour, but then Eric is just so plain :-("
This is going to flop so hard.
"One thing I don't get is, why didn't they make her hair red? She's a fictional creature yet Mera from Aquaman pulled it off. I like she dyed it with clay, but that impossible underwater."
Looks like more cgi trash. No thanks.
I don’t like how nothing is brightly colored anymore. Everything is super dark.
Her hair should be more red it’s just brown
I’ll stick to the cartoon where Disney belongs.
Dollar Tree knockoff Halle Berry in the lead role.
I want to see a remake of Tarzan with a black lead.
"The trailers made me think Melissa McCarthy was miscast.  She's too soft-spoken to be Ursula.  I can see in her eyes that she's hoping her performance is good, rather than seeing Ursula."
I thought this came out like a year or so ago. I feel like I've heard about it for ages
I can’t believe they’re casting a grouper as flounder. This needs to stop!
I feel like they’ve been promoting this movie for legit ten years
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
"A story about a minor who really wants to fuck the handsome mid-20s guy next door, with the help of her local pimp."
The idea of a 'live-action' film with talking animals peaked with Cats and Dogs.
"I wonder if the animators will include all the same phallic depictions, you know, to stay true to the original."
"Haven’t watched the last few live action cash grabs, doubt I’ll watch this one. I honestly thought it had already released.

Hopefully we get some good memes out of it"
"They played the trailer before the Mario movie and a little girl said ""That's NOT Ariel"" and the whole theater laughed."
Yikes
Cant wait to see how they screw up the live action Stitch…
"If they were going to change the names of ALL of the sisters, why TF didn't they just change the name of Ariel as well?"
The realistic looking animal thing they’re doing with these is so stupid looking
Garbage
This movie looks so bad. 🐠
"Get ready for the most exhausting and stupid debate of all time over this movie. Normal people will just agree it's bad and move on, whereas dipshit right-wing grifters will lament its ""wokeness"" and Hollywood agenda, while knee-jerk activism-by-media-consumption braindead liberals will decry any criticism as racism and sexism."
I already know Awkwafina is going to ruin this for me.
"🎶it’s so shitty (it’s so shitty), it’s so shitty (it’s so shitty), there’s no mistaken, this turds a maken no money. (It’s so shitty). You’ll never get this out your head, you’ll sing these words until you are dead, it’s so shitty🎶"
"So, Cleopatras dad is white? Hmm"
Woah Halle Berry is young looking still! Said myself unbeknownst of the modern crime of humanity false advertising
"I do wish her hair was more red, it is such an iconic part of the Disney version of this character."
They made Ursula white?!
Soooo they’re going for the emotionless look with the sea creatures… because it worked so well in The Lion King.
"Just because Jungle Book was a success, doesnt mean to they have to adapt everything else to a realistic looking creature. They never learned from Lion King"
"Shes white as a ghost with red hair, enough of the overly inclusive virtue signaling already."
"The Little Mermaid is my favorite Disney film, and I think this is going to be lovely. You have to hope that they took A GREAT DEAL of care in honoring the source material (1989), knowing how many people love ""The movie that saved Disney Animation"".

I think Halle Bailey is a great choice and her voice is amazing, judging by the previews. I'm predicting that it will be a different spin, but a satisfying one, and I do hope that people give it a chance before knee-jerk panning a film they haven't even seen. This is a big responsibility for this young lady, and I hope people give her a chance."
These are actually really nice
So this takes place in the Galapagos? Scuttle is a bird native to the islands
What's wrong with the Ursula poster? I can't quite put my finger on what it is but something just looks incredibly off
"I've been ignoring these remakes, but I have a good chance of having to see some or all of it with my nieces at some point. The older one flashed me the biggest smile when telling me how the new little mermaid is black, like her. Yeah, it's a soulless cash grab by Disney, but if my niece enjoys it and feels a little better about herself, I'll deal with it."
"I actually like this kind of character poster

it seems like they're in a scene, and you shot them

&#x200B;

unlike some character poster, especially in marvel ones where it seems like they are in photoshoot or sometimes a badly photoshopped actor"
"Someday I will not read Halle Berry, but this is not the day."
"I can't wait to never watch this. The Little Mermaid was/is my favorite Disney movie, and so far all the remakes have been sad or terrible. Not going anywhere near this."
I could have sworn that this movie came out months ago.
Lmao I hope Scuttle is as nuts as their appearance 😆
Beautiful!
Are people making as much noise over the dull and unsuitably potato-faced thirty-something Prince Eric actor as they made over the actress playing Ariel?
She’s just so pretty. And her voice is amazing. I’m super excited to see it!
I’m gonna stick with the live action Beauty and the Beast with Emma Watson. It’s a GOAT.
Wait…there are actual adults on here mad cause it’s not exactly like the cartoon? Lol
Damn her hair is gorgeous in that poster.
"As thousands lean into their keyboards ready to type   how offended, oppressed, and triggered that she's the wrong race, skin tone and that none of the other fish or characters are trans."
"Love Halles hair

Jesus getting downvoted that much for liking her hair? Holy fuck"
Eric and Triton look great. The rest are either ridiculous or meh.
"Wow the casting for this is great, looks how I remember the movie."
"Good looking, even Melissa that i can´t stand its nice as Ursula"
Daveed Diggs As Marquis de Lafayette As Sebastian
I wish they made her hair more red :/
Halle Bailey? Halle Berry
Holy shit Awkwafina is just so hot right now!
"First Disney movie to make zero money, no way"
"I wish Jacob Tremblay would do another live action, dramatic role. He's such a powerful actor."
Finally a fitting role for Mellisa McCarthy.
I hope it's a good movie!
Stunning!
I don't get how everyone is so pissed off at the Ariel casting.  That's literally the only thing I've seen about this that doesn't annoy me in some way.  I'll give them a chance as this story could actually work well in a live action presentation but I think they're gonna botch it.
"lmaooo has this not come out yet?!

&#x200B;

W all the racists losing their mind I assumed this came out last year"
Anyone has textless?
You’re not supposed to want to fuck Ursula!
Put YMS on suicide watch
People are going to have so many opinions about these... But I can't get past the poor kerning.
Is Zack Snyder directing this?
They totally botched the animals. Christ how hard is this? How can anyone think those are acceptable?
Triton and Eric's look like Gucci print ads.
Ah yes a walking cooked crab
Anyone else find some of the characters to be very creepy? The whole thing seems so dark and spooky.
king triton not hot enough
DAVEED DIGGS IS SEBASTIAN?!?!
"I've only seen the original animated movie, so I guess I missed Flounder developing a meth problem."
"I’m getting Paul Dano vibes from flounder,"
I thought with all the complaints this already came out. You mean to tell me it hasn’t even come out yet?!
"Nah man, Imma watch Barbie and Oppenheimer, ON THE SAME DAY."
"Everything I've seen of this remake so far is utterly awful, which would apply to every Disney live action remake before that as well. Even the singing felt hollow and lack emotion, it's just a lazy imitation of the original animated movie without the heart and soul."
Awkwafina continues her conquest of trying to be in every kids movie lol
"cool posters, but wow Sebastian looks creepy to me"
That Sebastian looks awful
"Is anyone else seeing Brandon Fraser's ""The Whale"" face in Flounder?"
"But really, does anyone else absolutely hate Melissa McCarthy in this?  

Like, all I can hear is a harsh discordant cackle, not someone who can be sultry and even a little seductive.

Couldn't they have at least gotten Queen Latifah?"
Looks like a 'ill be waiting for it to come on Disney+ and then maybe ill watch it just to see how bad it really is' movie
We all know the biggest problem with these is the art direction (remaking it as an animated cartoon might be a better idea than these bland live action). But the casting for these is a close second. Melissa McCarthy? It is a name I guess.
I read that as Halle Berry and became instantly confused at what year it is
"The hyper realistic animals and Melissa McCarthy casting are still tripping me up. We shall see. 

On D+."
"Why is flounder white? 
Gretchen: omg u cant just ask why ppl are white"
Why does Javier Bardem hair look dry? Isn't he supposed to be coming out of the water.
Ursula along with Flatsom and Jatsom have the best designs. Melissa McCarthy looks great as Ursula and Flatsom and Jatsom actually look pretty terrifying but in a good way. The others look fine but Sebastian looks really uncanny with those eyes.
The prince is very handsome
"They got Ursula’s look spot on

But the thing is Sebastion one of my favourite Disney characters doesn’t look fun like he did in the animated version"
Kinda wish they had use prosthetics for Ursula and make her generally scary to look at
"Fina with her blackcent...I.never really saw it as anything other than how she was. Apparently it's a thing she does. Wonder if she'll catch shit about it again. 

I hope not but with everything else this movie has going against it. I can see that being added to the list."
I mean who uses a rectangular movie poster?!  It's so gimmicky!  And what is she supposed to be singing or something?  Not believable.  0 out of 5 stars.
Ursula's eels look so cool! Eels have got to be one of the cooler sea creatures.
"Personally, I’m looking forward to Batgranny’s cameo most."
So is Ariel still 16 and chasing that dude??
Sebastian looks like crab...
"Somebody was spreading a hoax of what Flounder would look like a few months ago: https://amp.knowyourmeme.com/memes/live-action-flounder-hoax-little-mermaid

… honestly, I can’t tell which looks worse at this point"
Such weird casting for Ursula and Triton.
Shouldn’t it be “lil mermaid”?
Flounder isn’t even a flounder…
"Wow this is going to fail, looks horrible. Wonder what Disney will blame."
"Seriously, why is Disney doing this to us? This is my favourite movie as a child."
"Easy fix. 

Have the animals look like the cartoon counterparts to the merfolk and each other (and therefor also to us, the audience), but like 'real' creatures' when encountered by the humans. 

Sorted."
Is that the mermaids friend or something?
"All the other issues aside, Melissa McCarthy looks like Marcia Gay Harden."
Why did they make eels the bad guy???
I’m ready for this to bomb
"I usually don’t even bother watching the Disney live action because they’re so awful (I’ve tried to get through beauty and the beast, Aladdin, and lion king but had to turn it off halfway because it was so boring/irritating) but I’m holding out hope on this one being fully watchable. My prediction is that it’ll be uncanny and lifeless much like the others BUT I think Halle is a rare gem, her vocals are perfect, and she appears to have the charisma and energy to bring Ariel to life. I expect she’ll be the standout in an otherwise mediocre film."
I hate the realistic animals but someone tell me why flounder is a Sergeant major fish?? There's literally an official  poster with a bright yellow fish with blue Stripes (Royal Angelfish). Surely that would have been a better pick? I don't think the original flounder was meant to be a sargent major fish so it confuses me that they didn't pick a fish that better fits his original look. Such a weird choice.
"Live action remakes should stop.  
Hopefully after this flops, they will learn a lesson."
"[she looks all wrong, this is much more realistic!](https://ih1.redbubble.net/image.335585626.1313/flat,750x,075,f-pad,750x1000,f8f8f8.u3.jpg)"
It's a cursed image for sure.
Really highlights how stupid these live action remakes are and that animation makes the most sense for stories involving talking fish
He looks dumb as hell.
All the posters just show Disney didn't learn from Lion King - afraid of color and sacrificing character and aesthetic pop for the sake of realism. Ariel's hair isn't eye-popping red and that alone is a sin.
Flounder? You mean [Kent Dorfman?](https://tenor.com/fr/view/animal-house-gif-9018501)
Can’t believe they did Flounder like that.
Those dick-sucking lips...
"These uber serious posters with these somber “For your consideration” Oscar nominee fonts is beyond ridiculous.  I mean honestly, what do they think they’re making here?"
It looks like a fucking mojarra. I'd have no problem eating it for lunch.
I really love the human / mermaid character photos but the animal ones are oddly terrifying.
Looks like he's got Downs syndrome
Rest in peace 😔
"You would have preferred he have a big, giant fleshy human nose? Realistic cartoons are nightmare fuel."
Flounder looks like he's going through his emo phase.
"For real. [This ""deep fake"" video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1HGgICqZ3c) shows that you can make them cartoony and realistic."
">I'll never understand why they always opt for realistic looking talking animals in their remakes.

I mean, that's part of the whole thing: If the whole point of the remake is to make it ""live-action"" they're hemmed in. if they don't make the animals look ""photorealistic"" then it's considered a failure full stop. If they make them look animated (i.e., you know, GOOD) then what was the point of remaking it in ""live action?"" 

The money is in telling the audience ""That cartoon you loved is real now, so you can love it more."" and in paying (non-unionized) VFX teams to be animators (who are unionized) and animate ""real"" cartoons instead of the ones that can actually emote. 

Why nobody at Disney has seen fit to consider maybe remaking these animated films.. as **newer animated films**... I don't know. Like, retelling the story, but with new voice actors, new story changes, new animation styles and techniques not possible in the 80s... like any other remake might do. It's not an option. Because the first and only option for an animated remake is to make it ""live action"" 

But it hasn't been a single one of these ""Live-action"" remakes (that are still 75-80% animated anyway) that has looked better than their animated counterpart. They've looked ""realer"" I guess... and considering why these are being made, that's the aim, and therefore sad Dallas on the Nostromo Killll meeeee Flounder is a SUCCESS."
"Scuttle is a Nazca boobie, a type of bird near Mexico, Central America and northern South America. He also lives on the Galápagos Islands 

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazca_booby"
Sebastián looks like dinner. it was passable in jungle book and lion king but i can't genuinely see Sebastian and have him give me any emotional response his scenes in the trailer look like tik tol dubs
It's pretty obviously why. If they make Sebastian and Flounder as a cartoonist caricature.  Then they will have to make every sea creatures and land animals as caricature as well.  I mean it would be kinda weird seeing a realistic human riding a realistic horse body with a caricature head.  Best thing is don't make them talk.  Making a realistic animal talking with their mouth movement is pretty cringe. Just make the her like she is talking to herself when she is communicating and responding to the sea creatures who are making bubble noises is more than enough.  But they can still make every animals/creatures as a realistic caricature because I don't think people even care since it's a Disney movie.
"Because despite the film being complete dirt, The Lion King made $1.6 billion"
I'll definitely sign unto that outrage.  What are those creatures?  They need the sonic treatment.
"This is the most miscast movie I can think of. Why does Sebastian look like that? Did nobody working on this see finding Nemo?

And Melissa McCarthy does not have the right voice."
"Yo seriously, if you think about it, it’s just a picture of a fish lol"
"That irks you but not the fact that Arial was white with red hair?? Lol, what a fucking world.  Gotta have ""inclusivity"". Oh wait, it's racist saying that but not the other way around."
I can't wait to see how nightmarish they're gonna make Tamatoa in that Moana remake
I am 100% here for Awkwafina as Scuttle but that fish is deeply upsetting and no casting will save him.
"That was my thought too. Like forget the skin color controversy, this is the big problem in my mind."
"Probably to mesh with the human actors, so it all looks live action and not like a Roger Rabbit world."
Flounder looks like he has a receding hairline
"It looked soo weird in The Lion King… you have all these realistic animals, that talk like cartoons. It feels like a huge disconnect."
"Cute mascot ❌🙅‍♂️

Literally just a fish ✅💁‍♂️"
They look fine to me (???) because cartoony would just look silly amongst real people.
"I’m embarrassed to say that after 30 something years on this planet I only now found out that Sebastian was a crab. I thought he was a lobster. My entire life.

Disney has put me in an existential crisis. What could my life had been like had I known the truth? I am now what DeSantis fears.. woke."
"Moisture is the essence of wetness, and wetness is the essence of beauty."
"I'm not alone!

I immediately got a Nic Cage vibe when I saw that pic"
Nick Cage and an AI generated Prince Caspian.
Can we just get a Nic Cage mermaid movie? I’d watch it.
"""What's the most you ever lost on a doubloon toss?"""

Because they lack any of the neotenic features that usually accompany children's animation and character design in general.
"The art direction really is a head scratcher. Everything is dark, murky, and flat in color."
"I know it’s not realistic but I really wish they would have cranked up the red for Ariel’s hair. As gorgeous as Halle Bailey is, the hair needs some vibrancy."
"It's astonishing that the color grading *deliberately* went for that look. Doesn't seem to be an on-set lighting issue (Bojan Bazelli is an excellent and very versatile cinematographer), they just... digitally drained the images of life. On purpose. On a remake of The Little Mermaid, of all fucking things."
I had the same thought. It looks like a Synderverse DC movie. I don't get it.
"Tbf avatar 2 is an incredibly high bar as it's one of the most gorgeous looking movies, but yeah. It looks very dull."
Oh man it's brutally bad.
"> dead and colorless

Thats the art direction for all disney remakes. Absolutely soulless."
"Not the cultural erasure, but the lack of color?  I thought leopardsatemyface folks were more progressive 😔"
The 90%+ dislike ratio on the last trailer means you're probably not the only one unhappy about that.
Because the scenes are happening at night time
Sounds like the LADRCU (Live Action Disney Remake Cinematic Universe) to me
"Damn she looks good, would never guess she's 56 years old!"
Every. Time.
"O good, I thought I was the only one."
Didnt even realize it wasnt until you said something
"He literally just looks like a crab, are you afraid of crabs?"
"I'm gonna be honest, it's original Sebastian that was nightmare fuel. His entire head had no chitin on it, like it was just raw exposed muscle. And he had *teeth*. He could even retract his head into his shell, becoming the shape of a regular crab, implying that he *is* a regular crab whose mouth and eyes are doing some kind of a facial prolapse.

This thing, on the other hand, looks more or less like a crab. It's got some anthropomorphization going on what with the shell being shaped like there's lips and cheeks but if I saw one in real life I'd think it was kinda cute instead of vomiting on it."
How is a normal crab nightmare fuel?
He's still cute in the clip released tbh
"I always thought Sebastian was a lobster, not a crab."
That is pretty nuch as realistic as they can get with the fish still having emotion. Don't forget one of the bigger feedback of the lion king was a lack of emotion and too realistic. Like a dubbed nature documentary.
This is the gritty Synder version where they show the effects of pollution bleaching the oceans.
"To be honest, Blue Planet isn’t really how shit looks. Have you ever been diving? This is what it looks like down there. Actually, often times it looks even worse. It’s not crystal clear and bright blue down there."
"No, all that fuss was before anyone had even SEEN it."
"It's been in development hell for years. Partly due to coronavirus shutting down the initial shoot, and then they (from what I heard) had their budget slashed in half. Disney will be very lucky to break even on this."
"She now apparently, voiced by awkwafina"
Guy Ferrari would have been legendary in that role. What a waste.
"If Disney had any real guts, they’d have cast Harvey Fierstein as Ursula."
"> a character inspired by Divine?

Huh. TIL Ursula was inspired by John Waters."
Melissa McCarthy used to perform in drag as Miss Y in NYC. She even performed at Wigstock. Here’s a [link if you’re interested!](https://www.queerty.com/melissa-mccarthys-not-just-a-drag-fan-ally-she-was-also-a-drag-performer-at-wigstock-in-the-90s-20230317)
"Well you need a larger woman, for starters. And they clearly wanted some recognizable names. I don't see what's surprising"
"My one thought was, ""How does hair loc up underwater?"""
Disney really had a chance to cast a gay drag queen (maybe even a black one) as tha character is basically is a drag queen and decided to go with some white woman.
Simply another checkmark for the quota
"It was inspiration, not the whole character. It was still a woman and Melissa McCarthy is great."
"Normally black women are cast as strong and independent types. 

Ariel as a character was not really in that mold so knowing Disney I’m sure the goal is to beef up the character to empower women as well as play her transition in a way to specifically connect with to the trans audiences."
"Black Ariel isn't even the problem if anything I'm glad they're giving Halle Bailey a shot as her singing is great. But the rest of the movie, the lighting, the effects, the ultra realistic, lifeless characters. It's all so dull and drab in an attempt to keep the budget low(er) and print Disney more cash"
"I've heard people say ""everyone upset with black Ariel"" a hundred times but have yet to actually see anyone upset with that"
The trailer doesn't give much hope. It feels like they needed a name and so went with a famous larger lady regardless if it fits.
I don’t think people are upset with black Ariel as much as they are upset that they deviated so much from the iconic Ariel from the animated version.
"People say it was because of getting the water effects right, but I say the main reason it took them this long to remake Little Mermaid was because of the Ursula casting.  Was a true “damned if you do damned if you don’t” scenario.

Like, if you cast a large woman, it’s fatphobic.  If you go the Divine route, it’s anti-LGBTQ.  If you say screw it and go a different path, fans whine about it not being “true” Ursula.  

I honestly think they did the best they could with that character, from what I’ve seen.  In terms of everything ELSE about the movie though, holy fuck.  Well, I shouldn’t be harsh, and I’ll reserve judgement till I’ve seen it.  

But considering the last Disney “live action” remake I liked was Cinderella, I have zero good feelings about this one."
The Way of Water
The Little Shape of Water.
"More like vocal minority on reddit hates it. That's why all these movies that reddit claims ""everybody"" hates make insane box office returns. Evidently, everybody doesn't hate these movies."
I’m pretty sure this movie will be as disappointing as the previous Disney remakes. I’m also pretty sure I’ll see it in cinemas.
"You mean the highest grossing animated movie *of all time,* when it released?  I suspect they definitely learned, for better or worse…"
"Oh they learned how to make a lot of money with that movie, so they're doing the same thing and hoping it works a second time. And it will, because people are suckers and will give Disney their money"
They learned all they needed to when the movie made a billion dollars.
they learned that people will see this crap no matter how bad it is.
It made 1.663 billion USD. I think they took a lot away from that.
"Disney really had her wearing her hair in scarves for like a year to hide the red, and then it's this..."
"Agreed. I just wish her hair was a little brighter, because her red hair and green tail were meant to contrast. Having brown hair and blue-green tail just looks more dull."
Getting rid of redheads is a very weird but common trend in remakes.
They actually trie but they fear that any more bleaching would cause damage too her hair (she us not jsut an actress and loc like this can take 5 years to grows) and the temporary dye was washing out in water.
"Totally agree. Idk if it’s the grade or what, but the hair colour and her makeup makes her look very washed out. Everything seems muted."
"I think it looks good. Obviously red while suiting her complexion and looking natural. Fire truck red is just not a common natural color even on real redheads, it’s tricky to find OG Ariel colored dye/wig where it doesn’t look cartoonish or tacky."
Good thing it wasn’t designed for adults but for little girls instead.
Scuttle has always been an annoying character. I think the original was Buddy Hackett with that terrible New York accent. Bleh.
I was so disappointed when I heard her voice in Raya.
What's with the Awkwafina hate? I'm out of the loop.
Immediate pass for me as well.
"Holy crap ! So the orca (sextina akuafina) from BoJack horseman was based on an actual person ? Wtf 
 Is it good that I haven't heard from it ?"
I thought she was a terrible choice as Sisu. She was good as Webs in The Bad Guys though.
"How awful is it that this cycle is understood now? Like, when Kenobi scapegoated racism for the reason the show was underwhelming? Or Lightyear's lack of success due to a kiss? 

They have this built in excuse to cover for the uninspired writing and bankrupt creativity when their products, once again, are culturally irrelevant."
Ass hair?
“YER DA SELLS AVON!   Now go get an Irn BRU so we can watch Still Game!!”
"Which ones?

Awkwafina is annoying as fuck, but the others are all pretty good

Or are you one of those ""FISH LADY SHOULD BE WHITE"" morons?"
"As a girl I honestly find eric underwhelming,"
"*respectfully* disagree. 

My unpopular opinions: I’m warming up to the new Sebastian. Looks kind of cute the more I look at him. Prince Eric, while nice looking, lacks the “hot” factor.

I actually really like their casting for Ariel, as long as she can act well (haven’t seen her previous work)."
"Is this a sarcastic joke? I'm of Danish descent, and I'm trying to figure out why this would be offensive. Because it didn't stick to the book? The previous Disney animated version didn't. They changed the characters' basic features? Miyazaki did that with Ponyo. Because it's probably not great? The circus version already was. Not enough parkour and interdimensional aliens? Bubble has you covered, at least."
You’ll survive
in recent years adults are almost always used to play teen roles. she’s only 23 so out of all the casted live action princesses so far she’s the youngest one. Jasmin is a teenager too but Naomi Scott was 26 when Aladdin came out
She was still a teenager when she filmed it.
"Do you need to check the last name closely? I did...

This actress is only 23"
"Hopefully they aged her up.

Rewatching the original with my kids and realizing she meets the prince and gets married at 16 has me feeling MAJOR ick."
"Yeah, I am honestly looking forward to the soundtrack, though not the movie itself. It's also got original songs with lyrics by Lin-Manuel Miranda and music by Alan Menken, which is a pairing I've wanted to see happen for a while."
I heard her full version of “Part of Your World” released today. That voice. Wow.
I’m glad they cast someone who can actually sing. Emma Watson was struggling as Belle.
I don’t find Halle’s voice to be that good tbh
"Dude was basically just Guy in White Shirt in the animated version iirc, right?"
His trident looks blunt and moldy.
I remember when everyone was saying that about Aladdin.
"This movie is going to do well, but maybe not as well as Beauty, Lion King or Aladdin"
"Flop creatively speaking ? I couldn't agree more. 

Flop economically speaking ? I think you underestimate the power of parents, grandparents, uncles, aunts taking their whole families to the cinema theater to see a family-friendly Disney movie that has a familiar story. 


I hate those remakes (except Cinderella, that one has a special place in my heart) but... what can we do ?"
I heard pre-sales for Little Mermaid appear to be strong. Aladdin all over again.
"It's a fish-out-of-water story, of course it'll flop."
"I wouldn’t make any sure bets either way. It’s certainly *possible* that Disney-remake fatigue has finally set in, but on the other hand, Disney nostalgia is a pretty powerful force. As is parents just taking their kids to see a movie appropriate for them, critical success be damned."
"There is a theory going around that everything is desaturated in the water because Ariel finds it all so dull

And when she goes to the land, everything will be bright and exciting"
"They do that, they are finished."
That's just Mowgli.
I swear they've been talking about this movie for four years now.
Plz no :(
"You can’t deny that this is just stupid though and screams diversity quota. If they actually wanted to have a black princess, Princess and the Frog would’ve been MILES better to adapt. Such a better movie to go off of too."
"It is the hair I don't understand. As far as characters go, Ariel's hair is pretty iconic. It is the desire to go hyper realistic that spoils these films. While I feel like it is a mistake casting Merissa McCarthy as Ursula, she at least has the iconic look (weirdly I thought that would work going hyper realistic)"
I guess the only winning move is simply not to play.
Two reasons for popcorn!
Especially since there’s century old evidence that the “Little Mermaid” is actually brown.
what….
"Apparently it did, at over $1.6 billion in revenue."
You mean the Lion King that made over a billion dollars?
"I wonder whether you actually want to know why, or just want to act indignant."
"Considering that mermaids only live in the deepest parts of the Mariana Trench, I don't think Disney is too concerned about realism.

They'll learn their lesson when nature-savy kids are leaving the theater crying and red-faced parents are screaming for refunds."
"""this movie about mermaids isn't realistic enough, that bird doesn't live where the movie takes place!"""
"Eh, broadly probably pretty close.  Dutch West Indies would’ve been my guess for a good age of sail setting."
Melissa McCarthy is on it.
I saw a picture of them standing together and people were saying she looked liked his kid on her first visit to the beach.
the way you got downvoted for being excited for a disney movie is crazy lol
Not surprised at all that you're being downvoted.
Cultural appropriation.
Oh you know why they're pissed lol
I find it hilarious. they are seriously underestimating this movie. It’s so interesting that anyone in these comment section say anything positive at all about the movie they’re downvoted.
"I agree, the actress has a cute baby face and a nice voice. I really dislike how it's difficult to talk about actual merits or issues with a film/TV show nowadays. Just endless boooring (and yea racist) manufactured outrage about casting."
"McCarthy use to do drag and she impersonate the drag queen that Ursula was inspired by, she will do fine. I do wish they would stop with the realistic animals and just make them a bit cartoony."
"This is your favorite movie as a child, perhaps it is time for it to be another child's favorite movie.

A new version does not negate your version."
And not Sebastian?
"It's all heavy animation still, but again Disney is just going with the really weird choice of highly-photo realistic designs for their non-human characters. It just doesn't work very well.

 You're trying to get a fish to emote like a human while looking exactly like a fish, without any embellishment on facial features. Unless they do something really clever with the kinematics it is unfortunately going to be a really flat performance for the characters."
You mean your fish don't talk to you?
"Ehh it's probably because we're coming from an animated film.

Plenty of movies with talking animals work."
Disney doesn't care how stupid this looks if suckers still line up to watch it in theaters. If the lion king can make $1.6 billion then this will print easy money and until they stop printing money these lazy remakes will continue
Its not that bad in motion in the trailer. But obliviously a realistic fish talking is going to look weird. No real way around that.
Are we going to successfully bully them like Sonic?
He looks like food.
Disney learned from Lion King that these movies make billions and are a guaranteed box office success.
Why would anyone want their animal that SPEAKS ENGLISH to look realistic?
"> All the posters just show Disney didn't learn from Lion King 

Didn't learn what? How to make money? Disney made $1.6 billion on TLK remake. They know audiences won't give a fuck and will be lining up to watch this slop, and it will gross another easy billion for Disney. They don't need to ""learn"" anything when the winning formula to make lots and lots of money is so simple (creativity be darned)"

Reminds me of a certain older Spiderman movie.
All de time!!
"It's crazy how much more expressive the ""cartoony"" ones are. I have no idea what emotions the photorealistic characters are supposed to be conveying."
"This looks far worse than the original remake, but to each it’s own… if I wanted to see the OG designs I’ll just watch the original animated movie…"
It wouldn’t have looked that bad if they could have just animated the faces to look like they were emoting.
"Have you seen YMS 's vids on Lion King? ""your movie sucks"".

This dude has a PhD in everything Lion king related.

If they ever make anything Lion King Related.. They need To hire him om. Board.

Including kimba The white lion.

Dude has horus worth of vids analysing lion king and kimba."
Personally I think that's a little too cartoonish to look cohesive in a film aiming for a near-photorealistic aesthetic. I think something more akin to [this concept art for the 2019 Lion King movie](https://www.deviantart.com/michaelkutsche/art/The-Lion-King-Scar-Character-Design-806972678) would fit the style a lot better. Strikes the perfect balance between realism and the animated charm of the original character designs.
"Nah, that looks worse. Going all the way with the realism looks better than some weird in-between."
For something that they probably put together on a fraction of a fraction and with less time that still looks better.
"That's good if they wanted to make them cartoony.

They don't."
"The “fixed” version is frankly distressing and gross. It also destroys the point of a “live action remake” and instead just kicks aside hand-drawn animation for computer, which is far, far more insulting.

Thanks, I appreciate what we got more now. It could’ve been this nightmare fuel."
"Why do I have a feeling that if they went this route, I wouldn’t be rolling my eyes every time I see them they and pull off a live action classic?"
Sonics redesign was perfect for that realistic/cartoon look. Not sure why Disney can't do the same
pokemon movie did it well too right?
Wow…that dude fixed my childhood with AI…
The only Disney live-action remake I've enjoyed so far was the Cinderella one. Mainly because they didn't copy the original story/music beat for beat.
">If the whole point of the remake is to make it ""live-action"" they're hemmed in. 

Live-Action Mulan disagrees.

Oh...wait...you were looking for a good example...

Never mind.  I withdraw my argument."
The Jungle Book was an enjoyable film. Though the musical number from Walkin was probably the worst part.
The problem is that Jungle Book invalidates your comment
I'm sad my boy Krakatoa is probably not appearing in Moana because if he looks like an elden ring crab i will be depressed
And Flounder is a [sergeant major fish](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergeant_major_(fish)) which is found in the Atlantic/Caribbean. No real overlap in there ranges.
Not quite. Scuttle is a [Gannet](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_gannet) which are closely related to boobies.
So Disney went with ultra-realism...except for the part where they misplace a species.
"Why is it that Scuttle's poster kinda works, but the other two don't? Is it the eyes?"
But flounder literally says “there was this seagull” which outs Ariel to king triton. So why not use a seagull?
"> Best thing is don't make them talk. 

Gritty reboot time, where Ariel is insane, pretending the fish talk to her and demanding a crab conduct the orchestra."
">Just make the her like she is talking to herself when she is communicating and responding to the sea creatures who are making bubble noises is more than enough.

Like Sven and Kristoff in Frozen? Not sure that would work with 3 supporting animal characters. How would they talk to each other?"
Jungle Book proves you comment false
Even the live action Tom and Jerry (2021) made every single in-universe animal into a 2.5D hand-drawn animation
She's a fictional character they can do whatever. She looks great in the role. The animal characters not so much.
…but Nic Cage isn’t in that movie?
Yeah he looks like the most generic sailing protagonist ever made

"I forgot what Sebastian looked like and thought you might be exaggerating for comedic effect, but you’re completely correct — there’s no way to interpret that character design that isn’t fucked up. ‘89 Sebastian is a Cronenbergian abomination."
"> His entire head had no chitin on it, like it was just raw exposed muscle. And he had teeth. He could even retract his head into his shell

Sounds alot like a penis"
I have to agree. His face was a giant lip.
This makes some sense and your explanation is terrifying. I think you’re applying logic to cartoon character designs though. I’d bet we could apply this same analysts to other Disney characters to hilarious effect.
Basically they made him a crab crossed with a turtle.
Jungle Book disproves this though
But it's about mermaids and talking animals so I feel like they don't have to use realism in the settings.
Doesn't help that the fuss went away and came back with each trailer and each news about the film and each poster aaaand this is the absolute worst time loop
"Did you just assume a fictional bird’s, who talks to mermaids, pronoun…."
"He'd make sure those poor, unfortunate souls had plenty of donkey sauce."
"Flotsam, Jetsam, now I've got her boys, the boss is off the chain!"
"The MAGAts are already losing their shit over drag after discovering it existed like a month ago, Disney might as well lean into it."
When they made the Platinum Edition DVD in like 2007 he is featured in several making of features on the DVD and all subsequent blu ray releases where they talk about Divine as Ursula's design inspiration. Also no one can replace the iconic Pat Carrol's voice.
"She was inspired by Harris Glenn Milstead, whos character was Divine.

[Here is a talk with the voice actress of Ursula, Pat Carroll (May she rest in peace)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9NWt3yViJ4)

Howard Ashman, who wrote the character was an openly gay man. He inserted a lot of queer influences in his work."
I mean the animators subtly put dicks in the art. I could very much see that production being large fans of Pink Flamingos
"I was a bit sad when Ursula’s actress was announced; I had hoped a live action reboot would launch at a time where a male drag queen would be allowed in a Disney film to honor the iconic Divine.

But I’m happy you shared this article! Maybe Ursula won’t be exactly as I pictured, but I’m confident Melissa can bring the full eleganza camp my heart desires. ✨"
I’m confused. How does that count as drag?
It's okay to say fat.
And how does she breathe underwater without gills?
I wanted Titus Burgess so bad. He would have killed it.
Can you imagine the maga backlash if they were presented with that casting choice?!
"> drag queen (maybe even a black one) as tha character is basically is a drag queen and decided to go with some white woman.

You would have liked it better if it were a White man?"
"She’s trans, not in drag, but Dominique Jackson from POSE was RIGHT. THERE."
[Jinkx Monsoon](https://youtu.be/Shcz5p7lioo) would’ve killed it.
"I feel like most people who voice that complaint, at least on here, are swiftly banned/downvoted into oblivion.

I will say it is strange seeing some people get upset that they didn't cast an actual drag-queen for Ursula because that is what she's based on, but casting Ariel differently isn't a problem."
"Can you imagine the backlash if they cast a white person as the protagonist in an adaptation of African folklore?  

99% of “racism” and “cultural appropriation” rhetoric is rules-for-thee, one-way street bullshit."

Wait a minute...
No you don't know da wae
I like how you’re downvoted for not just randomly hating on shit for no reason lol. Reddit’s hate boner for anything live action is weird as hell.
I'm surprised it has nearly 90% dislikes on Youtube compared to the other recent Disney remakes that get shit on this site.
">I suspect they definitely learned, for better or worse

for worse. Definitely worse."
"It still shocks me that people went to see that movie in their droves.

I know, it's some crap to sit the kids in front of for a few hours, but like... was there *nothing else* on in the cinema that week?"
It was the highest grossing animated movie of all time because of the music and nostalgia. It was always going to be a commercial success. The photo-realistic animation for singing animals was widely criticised though. Looks like they've done it here too.
"Learned wisley from Scrooge McDuck I guess, gotta get an extension for that money room now I suppose."
“Getting rid of redheads” by recasting them completely.
"So they should have used a weave or a wig, plenty of women use hairpieces with great success and it’s actually more protective for ethnic hair."
"Oh I assumed this was a wig, tbh. I guess it makes sense, but I'm not sure they needed to bleach further - just use a more intense red after the bleach was finished."
"I wouldn't really say that I'd prefer firetruck red anyway. But this doesn't really look red to me at all. I was thinking a little bit of a richer, darker red. Maybe [something like this](https://yasmeenaelsabeh.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/normal_rihanna_straight_red_hair.jpg)."
That is so interesting. Her voice made that movie for me.
"Not sure, I figured I would be downvoted. Personally though i don't think she's funny and I dislike her delivery. Nothing she does feels natural to me, it feels forced. ""Say joke now. Here is joke."""
"I don’t really remember anyone from Kenobi saying the criticism of the show was because of racism? I don’t think anyone from the show actually commented on reviews, critic or otherwise as both were quite average.  

There were genuinely tons of people commenting racist things about Reva’s actress among the tone of people who actually didn’t like it. You really just had to go to YouTube or instagram to see

Same for lightyear. I never saw an executive blaming the kiss as to why the movie wasn’t successful. If anything I saw more people say “it wasn’t Toy Story enough” (equally dumb reasoning) as to why it failed. 

I see this “Disney uses this as an excuse when their movies flop” but I’ve literally never seen an actual executive on one of these remakes say that"
"What a hot take that you can scapegoat racism.  I think you need to reflect a little, friend."
"Seems like there's another cycle, though: Casting is announced and the usual types make statements of varying defensibility, many outright racist. There are pieces written about the racist hate online the star has been getting, and anti-""woke"" rants from some internet radio guy that make the rounds, clearly contextualizing the casting as a threat to their culture. Maybe a producer talks for a second about that harassment or makes some general reference to not worrying about the opinions of ""that sector.""

Then the people who said that shit point to those pieces and statements as the reason they were mad in the first place, and try to rope other people in because ""they're calling all of you racist!""

None of the culture war BS deserved over a remake that looks mediocre AF. But if we think the Right doesn't consider racial equity a threat, we're ignoring them completely."
"She's only ever been in grownish, afaik. Her character was extremely different than Ariel. She totally has the voice, though"
What can I say? I like dimples and sleepy eyes.
"Oh 23 is fine yeah. I thought it said ""halle berry"""
"That's been a thing for decades, not recent at all."
"I forget how insanely long this movie has been in production for. I know Covid had quite a bit to do with it, but even so."
16 is nothing. Grimm's Snow White was 7. Juliet is 13 xD
Thank you! I didn't realize it came today. It's amazing. I think I might prefer this to the original!
I disagree it was worse than Jodi Benson’s
"Sure but they redid Triton and Ursula's costumes, to the extent that Ursula's nudity that resembles human clothing can be said to be a costume. Why not throw some of that creativity Eric's way?"
I was excited about Aladdin and I actually enjoyed it. Not sure how I feel about this so I’ll just watch it and hope for the best.
"I dont mean in terms of box office even though thats what my comment implies, but I was saying more in terms of the quality of the movie."
In terms of overall quality. In terms of box office I dont doubt its going to make a lot of money. Lots of kids want to see this and they will go with their parents so movies like this usually dont flop in terms of box office but I was talking about the rest
"Like I said, im not talking in terms of box office."
Except for Eric apparently.
Mowgli is not black
What specifically are you referring to? Are you saying white people weren't allowed to audition for Ariel?
"Oh the horror, that Disney thinks they might make more money with more than *gasp* one black princess!"
what
Not really it’s in a different ocean
"Oof, but yes."
He's 5 years older than her.
"That’s okay. Everyone has the right to an opinion. Not much takes my joy away these days 🙂

AND Melissa McCarthy is in it!"
Lmao that's because these people are DERANGED. Say she's pretty and a good singer (both true)? Downvoted
Honestly neither am I. Still pretty crazy
Because they took a white character and then cast them as a black character
This is no different than casting John Wayne as Genghis Khan.  People bitch and bitch about cultural appropriation but then those same people defend casting red-headed mermaids from several hundred year old Danish fairy tales with black people.
Screw the downvotes. I'm excited for it!
"Three hundred years of white actors only, playing the roles of Asians Latinos and African Americans : I sleep 

A cartoon character is drawn black : “I’m sure you’d have no problem…. etc etc etc” 🙄"
"Nah, I actually kinda like the Sebastian design. The shape of the shell makes him look like he has these huge bags under his eyes and big jowls, so he has a kind of ""exhausted old man"" vibe that suits him. Though obviously how well it works depends on how hard they lean into that during the movie, and how he looks while he's moving."
"Someone on the design team saw the animated film and instead of realizing that Sebastian is obviously a Hermit Crab, just thought “oh that’s not what the crabs at my local aquarium look like, I’ll fix that!”

Sighhh"
I'm not sure how Sebastian is supposed to emote looking like that. Hell how are we even supposed to tell the voice is coming from that thing?
You called?
It's the same problem The Lion King had. Aslan in Narnia emoted just fine 15 years earlier.
What we need is hi-def remakes of classics that retains the classic animation look and feel with higher frame rate and more pixels and colors. Something like Paperman (except the color part). Not these live-action remakes.
It's not really a big deal though. We've been through this with a lot of films already lol
">highly-photo realistic designs

I'm excited to see how they are going to do Stitch - should be horrendous either way"
"Sonic was not a guaranteed hit and the bad reception to the ugly design made shareholders nervous so they forced a redesign. The Little Mermaid is a guaranteed hit, whether it's good or not. Printing money is what Disney does"
"There's no way Disney would back down because they don't care, they know they'll make a few hundred truckloads of money on this movie even if it is hot garbage. Paramount couldn't afford to have such hubris when they made Sonic and I'm sure they were genuinely concerned the movie would flop if they didn't change it."
"Not guaranteed at all. The more recent remakes are flops and this Mermaid movie has been in the works for 4 years, only just releasing now, it ain't gonna be good. They can't cancel it though cause they spent so much money on it already."
What language do you want them to speak?
Welcome to the Kelp Parade.
*Finger guns*
"yeah for sure it's not perfect, but you're right, what we got blows lol"
"Lately they have been losing money, and this movie will continue the trend."
Plenty of people must like the realistic look or it would not have made so much money after people saw the trailers.
Well yeah if I wanted to watch the Lion King I'd just watch the Lion King. The remake just doesn't need to exist either way. I think the main problem with the current look is that the lions are indistinguishable from one another.
"Design wise, sure. Cartoon faces in a photorealistic setting just isn't it for me, but I'd suffer it just for a little color."
I agree with you.
I hope he makes a similar video critiquing The Little Mermaid
i enjoyed aladdin but thought jafar was miscast
"highly reccomend the beuty and the beast one, emma watson and the rest of the cast are great"
"Man I wish that movie had been good, because it's exactly what I would want out of these remakes. I want the stories to be told differently and not bother redoing stuff from the animated movies. I was *glad* it wasn't a musical, and I was glad Mushu was gone. I just wish what we got was better. I wish this new movie would just take a totally different direction than the animated one, but it seems like it's going to mostly follow the old script unfortunately.

At least the villain movies (Maleficent and Cruella) have been good."
And none of that shit is near Denmark.
I know it’s a fantasy movie but I wish they had done a little more research on the fish and wildlife. They should at least be consistent to one region.
"The original Flounder seemed to be modeled after a [saltwater angelfish](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1149/2028/products/IMG_8455_1024x1024.jpg?v=1603568889), which would've been a vastly better option than the fuckery they did."
Shouldve just kept it a seagull.
"It has the most character of all the animals because of its pose with the dinglehopper. The crab is just standing there and the fish is just floating, aimlessly."
It did some how miss the uncanny valley some of the other characters are on
Yes!
The Jungle Book proves this idea false
"moisture is the essence of wetness/wetness is the essence of beauty/but nicolas cage wasn’t in that movie

"The song is supposed to convince Ariel not to leave the sea, but considering what we have been seeing, I don't blame her to try her best to leave there ASAP"
Lmfao 😂
The first film to make a mermillion dollars
I hated that dress. Hated Emma Watson’s performance almost as much.
This is the one area in Disney's remakes where I would have actually liked a more muted/realistic take... imagine an extravagant rococo golden dress 🤩
Is the bird just chilling underwater?
">I've heard that maybe they are afraid that no adults are gonna give the movie a try if the colors are super vibrant and lively

That does indeed sound like the kind of stupid surface-level logic that a studio executive would confuse with insightful analysis and then impose upon the filmmakers. ""Let's make it darker and drain out the colors, I'm sure this will convince adults ashamed of their inner child to go watch a movie called The Little Mermaid.""

>Because honestly yeah, lots of modern ""adult/mature"" cinema (and even videogames) feel like you are inside a goddamed cave

Indeed. And you know what's funny? That style never wins the best cinematography oscar. Dune is probably the closest it ever got, and even Dune is careful with it (Greig Fraser is one of the few cinematographers who can pull it off properly, though even he overdid it on The Batman). Roger Deakins doesn't use it. Emmanuel Lubezki doesn't use it. Robert Richardson would rather die than use it. And yet, that extremely dark look persists."
This is BS since Alice in Wonderland made a billion dollars
"Weird thing is, in The Little Mermaid's case it's not hiding the compositing, it's making it *more obvious*. I'm not exaggerating when I say that the saturation of the image is often lower than Saving Private Ryan. I'm serious, I checked it on a fucking vectorscope. Saving Private Ryan, a movie that was *deliberately desaturated in post with a bleach bypass*, has a higher level of saturation than several shots in a live-action remake of The Little Mermaid.

But what's worse is that the saturation levels are not consistent in the compositing. The protagonist's contrast curves and saturation absolutely do not match the background in [this shot](https://youtu.be/kpGo2_d3oYE?t=98). The vividness of the blue is completely isolated in comparison to every other color, particularly the protagonist's colors. She doesn't look like she belongs. The muted highlights on her hair are particularly atrocious.

To make matters somehow even worse, when looked at on a waveform, the brightness of that shot - which is sunlit on a bright day - barely makes it to 60 IRE. In case you don't know, the scale goes from 0 (completely black) to 100 (completely white). 60 is where that *sunlit* scene tops out even at its brightest spots. [This fucking night scene](https://youtu.be/opDlMeqRACI?t=32) in Blade Runner 2049 is brighter than that, and is way more saturated, too. And the more comparable underwater shots in Avatar 2 are easily above 80 IRE, nearly 100 in some cases.

So to summarize: whoever decided that The Little Mermaid should look like that is doing this for absolutely *no benefit and no reason whatsoever*. It's genuinely baffling and gives me an existential crisis.

EDIT: And to clarify, I talked about IRE in really simplistic terms, it gets more complicated than that, but for comparison's sake it was enough. I can already picture some color grader reading this and understandably frothing at the mouth at the lack of nuance."
"Speaking as someone who does this for a living: the color grading looks incredibly artificial and nonsensical. Even when she's on a rock above sea level and under direct sunlight, the saturation is *absurdly* low and the highlights are visibly dimmed. In some of the brighter sunlit scenes underwater, the saturation in the blues is *much* higher than in other colors, so the water looks vivid while the protagonist is clearly dulled, and that makes the digital composite much more obvious. The contrast curves are horrific across the board and the dynamic range of the images is severely underutilized.

This isn't an impression, I've checked the images on a waveform and a vectorscope. The contrast and the colors aren't even *close* to how the human eye would perceive them in real life. The saturation levels are around the same as Saving Private Ryan, a movie that was deliberately desaturated with a bleach bypass on the negative."
Going to be epic when she’s battling Ursula only to realize their mothers are both named Martha
Too bad her personality is ugly to the bone.
You could interpret it as a cartoon character brilliantly designed by artists to make visual sense as an animated crab even if it's not realistic or logical.
Penises have teeth?
mayhaps a Geoduck
They are fish thought. Not mamal. I can't really imagine then more realistic and still having emotion.

"Yeah, but the Chinese market said no. The mouse only really cares about its bottom line."
"> a time where a male drag queen would be allowed in a Disney film to honor the iconic Divine.

Yeah no, I don't need a children's film to honor a literal dog shit eating erotic performer. Why are people so insistent on this."
I was also disappointed as a huge drag fan but Melissa has a long history in our community! She’s a great comedian and I have faith that she’ll kill it! I will say I don’t love the makeup but I’m also a picky bitch who does drag makeup so I’m biased.
Women can do drag. It’s very common and has been for decades.
"He was Sebastian on Broadway, so would have been nice."
Damn that would’ve been some perfect casting

At least in that case it would be going with what Ursula was based on.

oh yeah i’m sure but I was referring to Disney from what I remember they did typically cast teenagers for their disney channel roles i think? that’s why o said recent years i couldn’t really remember lol
It sounds more broadway-ish than the original. Not as sweet and pure as the original.
I for one welcome Prince Eric in a skin tight black latex suit.
"I did, too. I was so excited about it when it came out. I remember everyone on here talking about how bland the trailer looked, how Will Smith was going to ruin Genie. Then it came out, and people loved it. So many came back to this very sub and said they were wrong. Maybe this Little Mermaid movie will suck, but also, maybe it won't. I think we should just actually watch it first and then decide."
"You're not wrong, it was. But everyone was on here calling it a failure before they even saw it. Then quickly changed their tune afterwards. I feel like people need to give movies a chance past the trailer before they decide they're awful. We don't know anything right now past a few photos and 2 minute trailers."
That’s not a what a flop is.
"You didn’t learn from how everyone ignored half of the best picture contenders didn’t see them. They flopped because of their marketing and audiences stayed at home, when they were acclaimed and have high quality. “Flop” has been such a confusing term for years. They need a better word to sepearte the two kinds."
Oh yeah than I totally agree with you
"Why’d they change her skin color and not anyone else’s? Why’d they change Ariel’s skin color and not the race of any other character in any other live action adaptation? Why’d they cast a black girl into what was supposed to be a white role when they have a perfectly good (and quite frankly probably better for adaptation) princess and story to pull from in their animated catalog? 

And more importantly, they couldn’t even get her hair right. Looks dogshit, which just draws more attention to the fact they cast someone with dreads instead of an actual redhead to play, you know, a redhead?"

"Yeah, it looks better than I could have hoped for. Flounder was always gonna look weird"
Sebastian seems to show some emotion. Probably the most emotive sea creature of the film.
"He’s not a hermit crab. Hermit crabs get their name from the shells they inhabit, which they change out as they grow. They borrow these shells from other species, making them one of the most distinctive crabs out there. They’re also mostly quite small, maxing out at four inches, while Sebastian is a bit bigger than the size of a human hand. Outside of their shells, their body is actually spiral shaped.


https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermit_crab



Sebastian is a cartoon crab, so a bit amorphous to begin with. He’s likely just a general idea of “crab”. Even the crab emoji 🦀 gets across what we see as the definitive crab “shape”, which he adheres to. His shell is attached to his body, is flat and red and vaguely heart-shaped, and he has thin legs compared to large claws. Completely unlike hermit crabs. He does resemble a Christmas Island Crab, or an Atlantic Deep-Sea Crab.  The problem with the first is that is terrestrial, and the second is mostly aquatic, and both tend to grow very large. 

The crab they chose for the LA, the Ghost Crab seems like a good choice, being red, big-eyed, and capable of living on land and going in the water, though apparently it can’t handle living under the water indefinitely. Still. Works visually, and is much more expressive than the other crabs."
"Aslan? Bro that’s narnia, wtf"

"See that I would be a complete sucker for. Seeing Aladdin or Lion King in the current Disney animation style (like Moana, Encanto, etc) or Toy Story 1 in the Toy Story 4 engine/system/whatever would be really exciting."

"It was also 3 years ago, I wonder if a pass with current levels of AI would do better, not that we need that evil unleashed on holywoods minds. Imagine being sold the idea of rewatching the live action remake of the lion king that restores the cartoony nature by a hollow corporate mouthpiece. I fear this reality and that we're already in it."
"Are you referring to the Disney live-action remakes? Because that’s not true, and the box office results of the other three live-action Disney Renaissance remakes so far (Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast, and The Lion King- not counting Mulan, which ran headlong into COVID) look pretty promising for The Little Mermaid. It also supposedly has a $150M budget, which would put its break-even point at around $375M, and it would be difficult for it to miss that.

I don’t like the Disney live-action remakes either, but audiences turn out for them, especially remakes of Disney Renaissance films. This one will likely be no exception."
doubt it reboots print money. Disney plus antman and weird wold?( can't remember) have been the biggest loses i think
"I'm not sure that's true. Nostalgia is just a huge market right now. Quality almost doesn't matter.  It has to be somewhere north of dogshit and people will pour money into it. Until people start caring about quality in their nostalgia porn, it's not going to be a priority."
"Purchase of a movie ticket doesn't in any way mean that the purchaser likes the movie or prefers it to hypothetical alternatives. They haven't seen the movie yet when they buy the ticket, after all.

""Well, people watched it"" as an argument for a movie's quality is pretty facile."
It's a Disney movie remaking a huge franchise.  That's all the thinking a lot of people do before they decide they like it.
Yes the remake wasn’t necessary at all.
"He was horrible. Not scary, maniacal, evil or imposing at all. I'm getting the same thing from Melissa McCarthy in this one. 

They cast for the look, over actual talent. She's talented but has none of what the original VA had and she was just a voice.

Even with her whole body, I wasn't getting a fraction of what Pat Carroll voice conveyed."
Too handsome
"Isn’t the Disney Little Mermaid set further south anyway? The houses look more Mediterranean to me. 

Apparently the LA one was filmed in Sardinia. Which is also the Mediterranean."
"At the very least, couldn’t they make Sebastian, the singing Jamaican crustacean, something besides a species of crab that can drown?"
I mean maybe they did their research and decided a variety of fishes /animals from different locations was what they wanted artistically
Why? What benefit do they get from people being able to go “you know these fish actually would be found in the same region in real life”
You wouldn’t buy scuttle getting lost?
She looked so bored lol
"Yeah, I don't get it at all. Those types of comparisons (like Private Ryan) really make it seem like a joke SNL would do about some dark, gritty reboot that takes out all the joy, except it's real. These fucking billion dollar family movies come out looking like a Saw movie, and the compositing looks more and more like those old MTV Movie Award sketches where they'd splice comedians into other movies."
*WHY DID YOU SING THAT NAME?!*
It's not Danish Folklore.
">The Little Mermaid is Danish folklore.  It was never about black people.

The disney version wasn't ""about"" white people either lol. The people in it were white, but their skin colors were largely irrelevant to the plot. 

And it's absolutely hilarious that you'd try to reference the folklore, because when you read it (and you 100% have not read it yet) you'll find out that it's far different from the Disney version."

"Right, it's China they need to worry about. Was it Chinese libraries that schlubby Second Amendment chuds were showing up at armed to protect the kids?"
"They ain't making no money from this, that's pretty much guaranteed."
"🙄 It was while acting in a movie. I like that subversive stuff in the name of unhinged, evocative performance art, like Ozzy Osbourne biting the head off a bat on stage.

I don’t mind Divine himself not being in a Disney film, I get it. But if Disney thinks it’s fine to reference his character heavily in an animated kids’ film just a few years after Pink Flamingos came out, I think having a live action reference to him fifty years later is fine lol."
That is so not all Devine was as a person and performer.
"Well, yeah, but I would have thought a woman doing drag means she dresses in a way that’s more associated with men. So how does that count as drag? I’m trying to learn what you mean by “drag.”"
Exactly! Have you seen the video of him singing Poor Unfortunate Souls?  [Edit ](https://youtu.be/1mz6tw5Zddg)
Do you think that matter to them.
You don't need all that to have an opinion m8
">he thing is it looks horrible to us - but 5 year olds do not care. They just want to sing along with the (changed - don’t get me started) lyrics.

You don't need to got to the movie to do that now. Especially with the soundtrack available on YouTube."
"I'm speaking strictly from an artistic standpoint, not a monetary one. Photo-realistic animals singing looked weird in the Lion King, and the reviews mentioned that. I was just hoping that might have tried something a little different this time."
"Aside from the very opening shot of the sunrise, the entire Lion King remake was animated. So no, it’s not live action."
DERP
I actually don't know what she looks like. I just know Kendrick Lamar thinks she's hot and that I think she was big in the 90s.
"Yes, it is. The definition of the “flop” is a movie that is a failure. Of course you can associate the box office, but thats separate. A movie can be a flop and make a billion in box office. In this case im talking just about the quality of the movie. I dont doubt that this is going to make a lot of money cause obviously a lot of families will go watch it."
"Thanks man. People are downvoting me for saying that a flop and a box office flop are two different things though 😂 which is a fact and a flop is used universally in the movie industey to describe a bad movie in terms of its production value. Usually in terms of box office people use the term box office bomb or box office flop. But its not wrong to say that a movie is going to flop (despite making billions). But oh well, these internet trolls know everything."
"Yes, and in terms of general audience opinion about the movie. From what I saw from the trailer, it looks like another bad live action from disney. This is just my opinion though."
"I'm not sure why you're asking me random questions? I'm talking specifically about something *you* said. So I'll ask again?

What specifically were you referring to? Are you saying white people weren't allowed to audition for Ariel?"
"Duh. It isn't out yet. Disney clearly has good reason to believe it will, though."
I don't understand your point?
"Animated Sebastian looks way more like a hermit crab than any of those other crabs, due to their huge wide bodies. Sebastian has a small, thinner, longer physique, and has a head more distinctively not a part of his body. [Hermit crab](https://a-z-animals.com/media/2022/02/shutterstock_1820647019-1024x535.jpg)! Or at least inspired by them."
"Thats what they were saying.

A better phrasing would be “That’s the same problem The Lion King had, yet Aslan in Chronicles of Narnia emoted just fine 15 years earlier”"
"It wasn't a slip. I was literally sayign they made Aslan in Narnia emote just fine 15 years earlier, and for some reason didn't do the same with TLK."
I was thinking more in terms of the Spider-verse style
"Netflix did that with the first Pokémon movie.

"I think this will perform even better than the first couple, just because The Little Mermaid was the first good Disney animation film in like 20 years when it came out, and the nostalgia is at peak levels even for people outside the expected demographics"
"Lightyear, strangeworld, and god.. the marvel dumpster fires."
"You are assuming the realistic cgi needs improvement, while the comment your replying to is saying general audiences prefer the realistic cgi and that it needs no improvement. 

Then you added sequels improving the look or quality when that wasn’t brought up originally."
Sure it was. Do you know how many Disney executives needed to make payments on their third yachts?

"They needed a crab that was expressive, red, and somewhat amphibious as he accompanies Ariel on land. They made an excellent choice. Very cute cartoony eyes on that species, works well."
Honestly I wanted the movie to take place in South America. I want a South American princess
"Lots of little things. She was really rude to people during filming of X-Men and a couple other movies. After she got Oscar for monsters ball, she said some things that were kind of dismissive of her mom. I don't know if she's calmed down since then but she turned me right off and I'm going to guess she didn't win herself a lot of friends during these shenanigans cause her career kind of nosedived generally."
Shhh don't say anything! Now they're gonna live action style Finding Nemo!
"So drag is the performance of *exaggerated* femininity. Or masculinity, in the case of a drag king, which is what you’ve described.  [Here’s an example of a famous female queen](https://youtu.be/PqoWD1elaQ0) Victoria Scone is a cisgendered woman who has appeared on two seasons of the drag race franchise"
"Drag is transformational performance art. There are many types of drag. It can be political or theatrical or comedic or any number of things. It’s an art form to express yourself and play with gender no matter where you land on the spectrum. I mean women aren’t getting in full drag every day when they put on makeup. I highly recommend looking into the world of women doing drag, it’s extremely diverse and gender shouldn’t limit people from getting out there and performing!"
They only love tradition until they don't like the tradition and burn it down.
"\> m8

Ironically, from the description alone it could be an American, Australian, or English guy."
"Yet somehow it seems to be a pretty strong indicator of who is going to have a strong negative opinion about Ariel being Black, ""m8."""
By that logic Avatar 2 is an animated cartoon movie as well
"I’m sorry, but that’s just not what the term means when describing movies. It is specifically tied to box office performance, a film is a considered a flop if it fails to break even by a significant margin. The dictionary.com definition will not be of use to you here, as that is not referring to its use in the industry."
I don’t know if they were or weren’t. They obviously weren’t chosen.
I... just... I can't... I think he's trying to claim that because the statue is brown the character is brown? Which might be the weirdest take I've seen ever during any element of discussion of this topic.
Try reading it in context of the post I replied to.
"Not at all. Look at the pictures of hermit crabs on that Wikipedia article. There’s no resemblance. Yes, he pulls his head into his shell, but not his claws. And his shell is a crab shell, not a borrowed spiral shell from another animal. His body is not spiral shaped, but flat.

In the picture you sent, that crabs legs are broad. Sebastian has tiny thin legs. It withdraws its whole body into its borrowed shell. Sebastian cannot."
No he doesn’t lmao he absolutely looks more like a general crab. I find it absurd you think otherwise.
"Oh, apologies, for some reason I assumed you were talking about the Lion King animated film. From the stills Aslan does look better, a nice medium between realistic but with humanising aspects"
And many people did not. The lion king remake was artistically bankrupt and nowhere near as acclaimed as the original. Just a cash grab based on nostalgia.
It is logical. The second one's jacuzzi just didn't have enough room for the fourth escort he wanted to stick in there... so here we are.
Isn’t Atlantica supposed to be a hub of oceanic culture that all species travel to? The god of the sea lives there.
Maybe he’s dead? He is a ghost crab
"She’s from the sea lol, she’d be Atlantean or something"
"Nah, you're not saying that at all. The animated version erased a ton of the ""cultural story"" you're referring to as well. You'd know that if you read the actual story. But you haven't, because all you actually care about is the fact that Ariel is black."
"No one said Lion King 2019 was a cartoon, just that it was animated. As in animators used key frames to animate the characters’ movements by hand. It couldn’t possibly be live action, unless you know any highly intelligent and fully cognizant savannah wildlife that can also sing and impersonate A-list celebrities’ voices.

Avatar was created using performance capture. Which is not animation, but in fact a performance done by humans that is captured and then rendered in the computer. And definitely not animated."
"Most of the actors in Avatar were heavily motion-captured.  But there were some animated elements, sure, but no cartoons.  I don’t think they had any actual singing lions doing the performance work in the recent Lion King, but I could be wrong?"
"I see what you are saying. In a conversation it happened multiple times to be talking with people and saying a movie is going to flop (and they dont mean in terms of box office). When I mean in terms of box office I usually use the term box office bomb or box office flop. A great movie can be a box office flop. Meaning that the movie didnt make as much as expected but it can still be a great movie. When Im talking simply about the overall quality of a movie (not considering its box office) I use the term flop to describe a movie that is bad. And lots of people do. I have been participating in many oral movie debates and usually thats how we say it. Maybe because there is not a specific term to differenciate. So when I said this movie was going to flop, im specifically saying its going to flop in terms of its bad quality. I have also checked many websites about movies and thats exactly what it says. The meaning of a movie flop is that the movie is not good. And than theres the box office flop. Two completely different things. But maybe the term flop is not the best to describe a bad movie. Thats not up to me though."
">I don’t know

Alright so then your previous statement was pulled out of your ass.

>You can’t deny that this is just stupid though and screams diversity quota"
"So, isn’t my “take” the more legitimate argument? Frankly I think my has more validity than yahoos with their knickers in a bunch about Bailey being cast. Do you have anything to add?"
"No problem, I cleared up the wording in my post so it was clear I wasn't saying Aslan was in The Lion King, heh."
"It's a remake. It's not supposed to be acclaimed.

A lot of people enjoyed it, otherwise they wouldn't make so much money."
"And media is never going to please everybody. I don’t care for these live action Disney movies. So I’ve never paid to go see them. I don’t understand why others get their panties in such a bunch over them existing.

They are financial successes. There are lots of people that want to see them. Just because they don’t meet your personal criteria for what a movie should be doesn’t mean it doesn’t meet others’. They don’t need to be critically acclaimed to exist."
"Dude, I think your ""take"" is something you came up with while stoned off your ass."
">It's a remake. It's not supposed to be acclaimed.

Then why make it. You’re literally proving my point. It’s a cash grab based on nostalgia, there was no artistic merit. 

>A lot of people enjoyed it, otherwise they wouldn't make so much money.

This is not an argument for quality. A lot of people enjoyed the most recent transformers film. It did not make it good. And many many more people thought it was shit."
"Dude, what’s your point? Are you salty because she got the part?"
"Pretty much all movies are cash grabs lmao. That's why they make movies.

Movies are meant to be enjoyed. It's like Mario. That movie is mid too but people enjoy it."
"Movies are generally made to make money yes, but most have more reason to exist than “people liked the original so they’ll show up to watch it no matter how pointless or shit it is”. There’s usually some artistic merit to it. At least with Mulan, as bad a film as that was, it was very different in style and plot, there was a reason to redo it in a different way. The lion king was exactly the same but worse."
"Most big blockbuster movies have the same reason ""people like X, so they'll show up"""
And many blockbusters aren’t particularly good cinema. The lion king was particularly egregious though.
"It’s racist because people of certain backgrounds were kept from certain roles because of their skin color. White people have no problem finding roles or having representation. 

Also Bridgerton is based mostly on fictional people. And how is it cultural appropriation when black and brown people existed back then."
Good is subjective
"Well yes, but what’s the point in any discussion on films if you reduce it to that level? 

You described the Mario film as mid earlier, that is meaningless if everything is subjective. Why should anyone care about your description of it, it may be a masterpiece to others."
Now you're understanding
Why are you commenting if all discussion is pointless then?
I thought YouTube removed (visible) dislikes
I honestly don't care who is playing ariel. I want to see live action Ursula. I'm going to be pissed if they replace her song like they did jafars.
"So my dumb ass kept hearing that Halle Berry was cast and I was surprised they’d cast her cause she’s like 50 and the character is supposed to be about 16. Then I see the pic and I’m like; damn they CGIed her face too much to make her look younger - it’s not a bad face but Halle’s face was just fine….. 

TIFU by learning there’s an actress called Halle Bailey who is NOT Halle Barry."
"I don't care much about the race swap as much as this is just another low effort live action remake for Disney that will 100% be a lesser version of the original.


Edit: I'll be honest while I didn't care much for it at least Malificent while a spiritual retelling of Sleeping Beauty it was pretty much it's own thing 100% Hell I probably won't watch it, but the new Mufasa movie will probably be more enjoyable then the Lion King remake just because it's new ground."
"i mentioned on here that my only issue was that her hair wasn't very vibrant and more of a natural red and had someone say it's not a natural shade since black people can't have red hair. i linked an article stating that yes, black people can in fact have red hair and they blocked me and reported me for being suicidal.

these people are everywhere

edit to confirm; *i* am not the one who said that black people can't have red hair, it was the person who blocked me over it who claimed as much."
Even tho I’m black. Don’t really care who they casted as the little mermaid. Just wished they stopped making live action remakes no one asked for. The originals are fine.
I can’t believe they hired a surface-dweller to play the little mermaid!
I’m not mad that she’s black. I just think this movie doesn’t translate to a live action remake well. The animation is more colorful and vibrant. The lighting  choices in the preview just seem dingy. I wish they took a more imaginative route and went to the extreme with bioluminescence.
"I mean, it has 1.4 million dislikes.

Saying thousands is quite the understatement."
People who didn’t give a shit about the little mermaid ready to die on a hill for her skin color.
All of this could be avoided if Hollywood learned how to tell original stories.
I wish her hair was way brighter! I hope they don't leave out Sebastian singing and make it like another Mulan which was not very good.
Well not all of them are racist. Some just genuinely hate pointless reboots
"Not to mention the whole “character wants to fit in outside where they currently are but are always being rejected by those they want to fit in with” trope this movie revolves around, making the character played by a woman of color gives off vibes i doubt I’m the only one noticing…"
Another remake no one asked for
The lobster is actually a crab
"People who are upset about this to that extent need to calm down. 

I was a child with very vivid red hair and was bullied for it. I adored Ariel because growing up she was the only Disney character that looked like me. I always got the Ariel barbie and had to be Ariel when playing pretend. I had a massive association with her because she looked like me. 

When the casting first broke I had a split second of disappointment that the live action version wouldn’t look like me. And then I realised that that was the situation thousands and thousands of black girls had growing up, except they didn’t have an Ariel then. So, I’m happy and honoured to share her.

If you can’t get over the fact that she looks different in this movie then simply you don’t need to watch it. But you also don’t need to devote your time and energy to tanking it - especially not going after this young actress, who is a real person with actual feelings. 

It’s not hard simply not to think about it anymore and not to be a dickhead about it."
People are really so pressed that an imaginary mermaid is black
"I don’t think a single one of the new Disney “live action” movies has been better than the original. 

Though something tells me these dislikes aren’t because of that."
Once again Disney proves they cant make new Original Content for black children.
"I won’t be watching it. Not because she’s black; because I don’t want to watch Disney butcher another good film. It may be a great remake, but their track record is awful."
Just another shit live action remake to never watch
"My only complaint, and I'm not even sure if I'm correct, is that wouldn't your skin naturally be pruny, pale, and semi-translucent living as deep in the ocean as they do?

But, that's from a scientific standpoint. In reality this is a fantasy movie about a half fish girl with issues. Who gives a crap what color she is?"
Thousands? Rumours say it has like over 2M dislikes from around the WORLD!
"The Disney version of Ariel was originally supposed to be blonde. But the animators didn’t like the colour they had to use for her hair in the undersea shadows. They thought it looked grey and boring. So the chose red hair instead. 
Point is, her look or ethnicity was chosen more by animation paint colour, not social or political reasons."
ppl complaining that she’s black and I’m over here complaining she’s actually grey and that hair just looks like old period blood … where is the magic?? It is dull af. Is this the muted/dull version we get for polluting the oceans??
Damn so much division over a kids movie. If we actually put this focus to real shit and realize we’re being pinned against each other we’d be so much better off
"Did I like seeing a character with very pale skin like me. Yeah I was.

Does it matter to the story line. No 

Do I care that character is played by a black actress. Nope why the hell would it matter, when it doesn’t affect the storyline. Why would it matter when it makes so many kids normally excluded included? 

At the end of the day you can identify with the cartoon version without being slighted about the live version."
I feel like the people who are upset with the casting of this movie are just highlighting there racism. There is nothing wrong with who they chose
"The racial discussion on this is so stupid because this is a live action with music comparable to that of a broadway performance, and broadway hasn’t been casting based on race for several years now but rather casting for adapting the music…. Like look at Hamilton…? Philippa Soo, Daveed Diggs, Renée Elise Goldsberry… 

I wonder if these people that care so much about the choice in casting for Ariel will give a single flying fuck when they see Sebastian hasn’t been cast by an actor from the Carribean… but a Jewish black guy? Don’t care? Then shut up…"
"I've seen the trailer and my only though was that the song is beautiful, it was a lovely voice"
"Fact of the matter is: nobody ever asks for these remakes, nobody cares to even give them the light of day because they seem to be a cash-grab and changing the very lure of what made the original animated one so memorable (like the unlimited possibilities with animation) and the poor casting decisions that exist solely to be inclusionary as opposed to original, they could’ve easily done a mermaid movie that would put Splash and The Little Mermaid to shame instead it just reeks of Hollywood’s decline and pandering to filmgoers who aren’t interested that much anymore.

Look at Regal’s bankruptcy.

Look at AMC’s huge decline.

Look at the box-office returns for some films.

I’m tired of remakes. I understand they don’t make up a huge chunk of films these days but they are getting very redundant and at this point deterring more people as opposed to uniting more."
"Heartbroken for the actress. I can’t get past 2 posts without seeing something about how poorly she’s being received as Ariel.

It should be a triumph for her, and I hope she has the strength to still feel that way."
It’s a kids movie. I bet if you asked little kids what they thought of Ariel they wouldn’t have an issue. It’s the stupid racist mothers and fathers making it an issue. I think she is lovely.
"There’s a very specific and very predictable set of people that have any issue with this.

Their minds and worlds are small, sad places."
I'm actually curious what a mermaid creature should look like. If it was real would they really be blue or something? Or maybe see through if they're from the depths. Would their hair be fins instead of the hair that creates all that drag? This whole controversy only made me curious.
"As someone who doesn't give a sh*t, I'm seeing a lot of people arguing that if you don't like her being black, than you're racist. And the other side is saying it's not about race but the change of character. 

I do love this!!"
"As a 37 year old man I think it's stupid that Disney is remaking all of their animated movies in live action. 
But then again my 4 year old niece is going to absolutely love it.
Dumb little kid doesn't' even care that the little mermaid is black now."
Lots of people projecting their insecurities on fictional children’s characters.
Its so funny that the anti-cancel culture crowd does this kind of thing.
"It baffles me that grown ass adults care this much about a children's movie, but that has baffled me for a while."
The people upset were never even going to see the movie to begin with. Why are we paying them any attention?
I’m a huge fan of the 1989 The Little Mermaid film but it’s almost 2023 and people getting pissy over Ariel being black are ridiculous. Disney didn’t come up with The Little Mermaid… Hans Christian Andersen did. There have been many adaptations of this over the years. Brandi played Cinderella before and I enjoyed that movie. I liked Hailey’s version of Part of Your World from the trailer. I mainly had issues with how dark it is (I get it takes place during the night) and the swimming looked a bit fake but I’m still willing to give the movie a chance.
I have this belief that a black mermaid is totally fine since a white Jesus exists.
Is this really the hill people are choosing to die on? Really?? It’s a kids movie FFS.
"I really can't bring myself to care about soulless live-action remakes of beloved cartoons. Especially not ones by Disney. But I really, really want this one to exceed all expectations just to piss off some racists. The response to this has been utterly shameful."
I seriously feel like I’m in a fever dream between Rings of Power and now The Little Mermaid. It’s getting to the point that when someone says “the woke crowd” I feel like it’s a stand in for the n-word. Pieces of shit hiding behind keyboards.
I am usually a “stay as close to the source material as possible” kinda person but Disney’s little mermaid is already completely off from it’s source material and one of those stories that could be reimagined with a variety of casts without it affecting their world building at all. I don’t get the outrage? Like we have Brandi Cinderella and Downton Abbey girl Cinderella and they’re both great and we can enjoy both? The “anti-woke” crowd needs to chill.
Racism still alive they just be concealing it
I hate this version of Ariel. Her skin… has no scales
I can't imagine caring about this.
Rightist identity politics get people angry about the weirdest stuff.
A black lady played Anastasia for about a year after the show went on the road and Anastasia was a real white lady. We saw the show twice and thought it was great. Did not even think anyone would protest.
So frustrating with people complaining about skin color when the story is about her giving up on her mermaid race to be of human race.
"I recommend everyone go watch the videos of little black girls seeing black Ariel for the first time. 

Fuck the haters. They can watch white Ariel if they want."
"Sebastian the crab really shouldn’t be red unless he’s cooked, but let’s not get too caught up in details about color.
Sebastian does identify as a crab.. right?"
Imagine being a grown man upset that a mermaid from a cartoon is black in another depiction. Oh man
Only thing that matters is the hair.  They fuck that up and it's not her.
it’s a fictitious fish… She can be hot pink with razor sharp talons for all I care.
"QUIT BEING RACIST FUCKING ASSHOLES  Yall know Jesus was far from white skinned, riiight??"
I mean...if you watch the trailer. Her voice alone is reason enough to cast her. Add in the fact that she is stunningly beautiful. I don't care what color her skin is. This is my Ariel...
White people pretending to care about gingers. LOL
I love her fins.
Maybe the people angry at Disney's casting should make their own Little Mermaid movie.
"If it's the most watched trailer, then it's had over 100 million views, if it only got thousands of dislikes then it did pretty well as only a tiny percent had a stupid cry about it!"
Why do we care if fish come in all colors?
"So many complaining the live action remakes ruin the originals didn’t see that all their animated classics have multiple animated sequels that were cash grabs on current IP. It’s easier to market IP you know the backstory to than brand new IP that you know little about.

I mean they made a Cinderella 2, living “happily ever after” was stretched in to a whole new movie."
"> as most viewed trailer

Only thing Disney cares about. 

Attention = revenue."
Anyone who cares THAT much about whatever race Aeriel is in the movie is a complete and total loser. Surely you have more important things that warrant your concern.
Racists gonna be mad when this film makes more money on its first day then they’ll ever see in their lives.
"Putting aside the race thing to mention another of people's complaints... Am I the only one that is actually really intrigued by the color and lighting? 

Yeah it's not the vibrant color of the animated version but I think the cold darkness really meshes well with Ariel's desire for the surface world. She's trapped in the deep darkness of the ocean and longs for the sun. I'm hoping it will contrast with vibrancy on the surface. Could be a really interesting take to really emphasize the difference between the two worlds."
"It annoys me that people aren’t talking more about how she killed that note when singing. I legit got chills with how good she sounded, didn’t expect her to remix it like that."
"Wow, not only is this article just a little bit racist itself, but it actually doesn’t know that the actress is part of the powerhouse duo Chloe x Halle AND starred in Grown-ish. But sure, she’s known for doing YouTube videos of Beyoncé music."
Hate this for them. These dislikes will not phase the movie or Halle’s career. I’m excited to see and hear this new version of the classic.
Grownups arguing and being upset over a fictional children character’s skin color. This country is backwards
Gonna watch this so hard.
*laughs in I’m seeing it 3 times anyway*
"I watched the trailer. Neat. Good voice. Lots of CG sea.


 Ok, back to what's going on in the real world."
"Why are grown adults so up in arms and controversial about a CHILDS MOVIE?
Crazy times."
Racist mother fuckers honestly I hope they all go to hell I’m sick of it. I’m not even a poc and I’m sick of their fucking shit. HB is going to be AB is going to be an amazing Ariel.
"Let's face it, they butchered every other live action remake so why do we expect this one to be any better?"
"Why not restore the original story, with Ariel having a fish head and a human body?

Also, whats the deal with the YouTube comments?  *The part where Ariel says ""They mostly come out at night. Mostly"" gave me chills!*

I laugh at each one but I don't understand the reference."
People forgot about the wiz and other popular media remade with black actors all because now a good chunk of white Americans think they are being threatened as the majority to being a minority. No other people are so scared of being outnumbered thanks to the transgressions of their ancestors when most of us wouldn’t be cruel like white people can be to minorities they believe aren’t exactly “American”
I don’t understand the outrage. The director said that the actress set the bar very high and nobody crossed that. She was obviously chosen for her talent.. if she can play the part well then that’s all that matters since her race had no impact in the animated movie
"Casts of Star Wars and Rings of Power reported receiving racist abuse, so it’s not surprising racists would target this—

cartoon?

These racist motherfuckers are mad at a cartoon mermaid reboot?

They need lives, so badly."
It’s insane that a trailer is this popular just because people are racist
People just hate black representation ig
"How many times do we need to see this article? It’s every single time it’s about a women or person of color in a popular franchise. Every. Single. Time. 


Y’all godda look inward if you actually care beyond “eh not for me”, you’re the problem."
99% sure the audience disliking the trailer weren’t the target market for the film anyway.
I hope this movie kicks ass for kids and the main character sees more opportunities in the future. She deserves it
Don’t watch it if you don’t like it?
People are just the worst.
A whole bunch of grown men that were never going to see the movie are extremely angry about a black mermaid.
Racist nerds who decided that last week they'd get offended about black elves and this week about a black mermaid. Before that it was about the one black person in House of Dragon. It's honestly pathetic.
Who would have guessed? Racism is alive and very prevalent
"I think to myself, maybe just maybe, if you are that upset about the color of her skin, maybe the movie isn't for you and you aren't the demographic. And *gasp* you just move on with your life"
"My experience so far has been the same experience that I've had with discussing Israel, which is if I have *any* criticisms or reservations I'm immediately labeled racist."
White conservatives are so fucking easy to rile up.
Adults getting so invested in a film meant to uplift kids.
It is going to make billions. I will see it 5 times just because of the hate.
"why can’t she be black, she’s a fish"
Its times like these were I'm glad I stopped giving a shit about Disney a long time ago.
"If your entire identity revolves around you being ""proud"" of being white, that means you haven't accomplished shit with your life.

All the opportunities that a rigged system can provide and you still suck at life. You poor bastard."
"Black people: existing.

White people: FUCKING POLITICAL BULLSHIT"
"Mermaids aren’t exclusive to European cultures either, the African Mami Wata deity (As well as the Yoruba goddess Yemaya) is portrayed as a mermaid. This isn’t exactly new territory for Hollywood either, since they have a history of westernizing stories from the Middle East to East Asia."
"Racism is the best thing that ever happened to Disney. All the free publicity, when they used to pay for it like suckers."
"So many people getting mad at a movie they were never going to, and still aren’t going to watch."
"The graphics look like complete shit, the cg looks awful. So far looks like trash"
"I wish people would stop acting like this is some sort of large conspiracy regarding race. This is to sell more product to a wider audience. Simple as that. Disney doesn’t care about wokeness, they care about making money off the largest swath of people they can market to at one time."
Too many bigots have access to the 'net.
"I find it funny that white people have it so good that seeing a black mermaid is somehow the worst thing that's ever happened to some of us.

If this genuinely bothers you, just remember this movie is not for you and move on with your life. Cause I can guarantee that you don't actually care at all about the Little Mermaid."
"I dare anyone hating on this movie to go look at r/mademesmile and look at how many little black girls are driven to tears because there’s a princess that looks like them. How their voices break and they scream in delight because this means they can be princesses too. 

You may not realize it because there’s been white princesses and role models everywhere, our entire lives. And this is so important. 

Anyone bitching about it being a live action remake— it’s not for you. Don’t watch it, then. It’s not for you. It’s for them."
"not that there is any dignity whatsoever with racism, but to be so racist as to pretend that you even give a fuck about a goddamned little mermaid remake is so shameful. just a planet filled with losers."
"Don't care what Ariel looks like, that voice was on point. And she looks like Ariel, get over yourselves haters ffs"
It looks magical.. fuck you racist haters..
It’s a beautiful trailer. I’m excited to see it!
I watched the trailer with the idea that she might be a little old to play someone who is canonically 15.  Then I watched it and thought that it’s more important to have someone who can sing in the lead role than to have someone who is literally 15.  Overall I think it’s a good casting choice.
I haven't seen white people this triggered since they made princess Tiana in the The Princess and the Frog black.
"I just watched it. I wanted to hear her voice. Because to me, Ariel’s voice was the most amazing part of my childhood with that movie. 

It moved me. Like my heart skipped a beat. Girl can sing and it is gorgeous. 

And am I the only one who thinks it’s ironic because she wants to be part of “your world” but is going to be straight out hated because of the color of her skin?

She can sing. Like really sing."
These white supremacists blatant racism aside.. Apparently this girl was chosen because of her amazing singing voice. However these people never cared about the singing or the movie in general..
"The best argument I’ve seen for against is that Disney wouldn’t dare subbing out a black princess for a white actress, but that they did so here in reverse. 

The other shameful thing is that they took the white fish princess and made her black, and I can’t imagine they wouldn’t allow this for say a Snow White"
That’s ridiculous.  I can’t wait for it to actually drop so you see all the videos of white Christian people explaining why they’re not taking their daughter’s to see it.  Let all the racism come out over a freaking mythical creature.
"This has and still is my favorite Disney movie and I’m so stoked to watch this! Aside from the underwater setting looking a little glum, I’m still extremely excited and that isn’t a deal breaker at all for me. 

Pretty sure the people that are shitting their pants in fury over this is because they didn’t like the movie to begin with or they’re not happy with the race swap. Plain and simple."
Adults bitching about a movie for kids. You hate to see it
"Ngl, bothers me her hair isn’t red. I read an illustrated version of the original by HansC Anderson and the mermaid was blonde which I hated. 

Tbh tho all the people hating she’s black… it’s set in the Caribbean, not Denmark, smh lol. Stay mad. If I dislike this movie it’s going to be bc it sucks, not bc she’s black. She’s also gorgeous, like why is it so offensive? I hate the thought of live action but Disney does a great job. I anticipated hating beauty and the beast and it was decent. 

You can’t please em all"
"They just need to STOP MAKING LIVE REMAKES OF ANIMATED CLASSICS. STOP. STOP. STOP. 

They universally look TERRIBLE. Fucking STOP"
Here come the totally not racists…
Oh thank God she's a redhead.
"You know, as a white dude I was not thrilled with this change to the character. Then I saw that video of those kids reacting to this trailer and I was like ""oh yeah, its not for me"" and I immediately shut the fuck up and moved on.

Let these kids just have a W."
Ahole new world
"Disney has been remaking all their animated movies and somehow this is the one people are in the uproar about? Not for that terrible Lion king movie, beauty and the beast,alice in wonderland, malifecent, Mulan, Cinderella, jungle book, lady and the tramp, or pinocchio. But for the one where the the main actress looks like she can actually sing and hasn't been released?  

Racists out in fold or else no one would have cared if they sludged through all those crappy remakes. 

Its going to make money, we'll see angry racists believing this is white eraser or evil woke corporations, then it'll disappear cause they'll be angry at something else."
I am going to see it to just to support it.
1.5 million?!?! That’s a lotta dinglehoppers
"What were Disney’s other live action remakes, and were they welcomed by audiences prior to screening?  I can only think of BatB at the moment."
"If it makes a child happy and let’s parents get some peace for 2 hours, cool, I don’t give a fuck."
"I’m glad when they changed things they didn’t want to invert the mermaid. (Fish head + human bottom half), it’s self explanatory why they would want to do this (Ariel doesn’t have gills and spends most of her time underwater)"
Why are all the YouTube comments weird quotes from other movies?
My only beef with all the live action remakes is I wish they’d just stylize the animals a bit more. They lose all their personality being made realistic. Aim more towards Dale in the new Rescue Rangers movie.
Youtube dislike coming from Russia bots
They’re just gonna remove the dislike button entirely after this.
"Do a lot of people actually care this much about it, or do a few loud people with multiple accounts just care too much?"
"Well, I went in here thinking, yeah I get the hate for this. It’s yet another shitty live action remake of a classic. I didn’t like any of the other live adaptations and frankly I’m sick of Disney retreading these same stories.

Except the backlash is because the actor is black? Are there really that many racists? Does this also imply that I was way off, and there was actually 1.3 million people looking forward to this before learning Ariel would be portrayed by a black actor? Good grief."
It’s a fucking kids movie. Let the kids decide.
"Way more likes than dislikes, a lot more US than them."
What the hell though is that all a result of bigotry or theres something more to it
"She sounds great but as they did with The Lion King remake, they decided to mute all of the colors for really no reason at all. The Wachowskis gave the world a cheat code on how to translate a cartoon into a vibrant live action film with Speed Racer but it seems to go ignored."
"Couldn't care less if she's black, she looks well cast and great as Ariel. What I didn't like was changing the song to sound like someone improvising the national anthem. Somethings are OK to change, but a major song like that? Phooey I say."
"I'm not the target market for these Disney ""live-action"" remakes. So far they've all been terrible. Having said that, my only issue with this trailer is that she doesn't appear to be underwater at all. That's probably going to look better in the final version. Other than that, you have to be a really racist piece of shit to get down on this for the casting."
Its ok. Regardless of skin color. Im not going to watch if
"Good Lord people are dumb. Good Lord, they made a cartoon character into a film, who cares about skin colour, you may as well be angry Ariel isn’t made in cel animation, it has an equal amount of bearing."
Oh boy. This thread is gonna get locked like all the others.
Do the complaining morons think that a fairy tale is REAL???
"All this outrage over who was cast as Ariel, but am I the only one disappointed that Ursula is played by Melissa McCarthy?"
"Are people really this immature? The Little Mermaid is black, so what? Get over yourselves
Im just upset they keep making cheap remakes even after Mulan and Lion King"
"I haven’t had anywhere else to say it so I’ll just drop it here.

Pete’s Dragon didn’t live up to my unrealistic expectations and I’m still bitter about it."
People suck. How dare a kids movie not live up to the expectations of an adult.
This could have all been avoided if they made her the fish on top and the lady on the bottom.
So many people are still completely traumatized over those lady Ghostbusters...I just don’t know how they’ll be able to summon up the energy to write those hate filled tweets again.
"Yeah, because they refuse to give me a live action Atlantis or treasure planet. I don't care to see popular movies redone but not as well. I want the movies that bombed to be brought back to life."
"I am such an idiot.  Me a few days ago...

""Okay the casting is weird, but not because she's black... but how on earth is 56 year old Halle Berry going to play a 16 year old kid?"""
The part when Ariel said “yippee ki yay mother f*cker” sent chills down my body. Absolute perfect timing.
I'd be curious to know if people would freak about a white Tiana in a live action Princess and the Frog?
People are concerned about skin color…?  I just want to know why Disney is out of ideas and are just spamming their cartoons into live action jokes…?
"Captain Marvel: Huge ""People who don't like it are sexist"" PR campaign.

Lightyear: Huge ""people who don't like it are homophobic"" PR campaign

Rings of Power: Huge ""people who don't like it are racist"" PR.

Little Mermaid: Marketed on it's qualities as a film.

oh wait, no, the other thing"
They should have pulled a switcharoo and made her top half a fish and bottom human. Just really confuse and piss everyone off. I’d watch the hell out of that.
"I think a lot of the hate stems from the fact that disney is pumping out garbage remakes left, right, and center."
wait till people see latina snow white and the seven cgi dwarves
"Hey man, after watching all those little black girls react the way they did when they saw a black Ariel, I say fuck you if you don’t like it. Go play your banjo and fuck your sister you racist POS."
Mermaids are not real so you can not say what color they are.
This trailer is BULLSHIT I mean have u ever tried to sing underwater????
Who. Cares. People are so dumb to even give an f about this stuff. But i guess some love to hate
I wonder how many bots disliked the video to stir up shit.
"The entire ""content of your character"" crowd switched it up to ""colour of your skin"" real fucking quick."
"Internet hate is stupid. If the movie is good, the movie will do well and most of the haters will promptly shut up/disappear. If the movie's bad....well we're just going to have to bear with a bunch of people blaming it on ""wokeness""."
The comment are hilarious.
I don't like it cuz the colour palette is depressing to look at
"i see those cringe representation videos on tiktok.  if you want representation, make original movies with black characters."
Live action Pinocchio didn't disappoint and they updated the blue fairy
Surely every trailer has 1000s if dislikes?
"What next?

Black Mulan? 

FFS Disney, Netflix, Amaon, etc Stop changing past and make new stuff where you can play with racial diversity if that's your thing to get attention/popularity..."
Can you just make a new movie? Stop remaking everything and get some new ideas. There are millions of stories out there.
Ya know what? I just don’t like it. No politics involved no racism etc. I just don’t like this I grew up with the original Ariel one that doesn’t sing like Mariah Carey I just hate this all of it I hate it.
My dislike had nothing to do with race. It just looks like a horrible remake.
More dislikes for the trailer is good
"Please take note that Disney always waits for people to already be sick of a trend in their content before casting a black lead, guaranteeing focus will be on race.

1)Racists lose their shit

2)Everyone rightly claps back at them

3)Actual criticism of content is drowned out

4)Disney lives another creatively bankrupt day

5)Rinse and repeat."
"I think the actress is fine. I’m just so done with Disney remaking average movies to be shit live action films and cashing in on woke points. This movie will be shit like the other live actions, not because she’s black but because it’s fucking Disney ruining everything yet again. 

If they really want a successful live action stop remaking musicals and do Atlantis. That movie slapped, you can fit more representation without people getting too upset about ‘retconning’ as it has a good amount of representation naturally in the main cast and it probably would actually be good and not many people saw the original so it’s a great chance to open up a whole new consumer base and possibly blow up a new franchise by getting out the old merch they never sold."
I watched it - and I liked it right up to the end. I couldn’t understand why she was singing but no bubbles were coming out of her mouth. Just bad cgi or something?
"Can I just dislike a remake without being called a bigot? Feel like that's the first internet  response to defend a shit product. 

You don't like the new star wars because it has POC!"
I cannot be as simple as we are sick of freakin remake after remake? I don’t care what color you make a character just come up with something original for goodness sake.
Disney is racist
It looks like a shitty cosplay lol Disney really phoning shit in these days
"I don’t care if she is white, black, yellow or pink but the trailer is just bad!"
"Movie execs before release: let’s make her black that’ll really get people talking and they’ll go see the movie 

Movie execs 6 months after release: everyone’s mad and nobody is paying for it. What’s going on?"
Are people really this mad about a black ariel?
"I hate how the realistic version of the ocean just seems so much less vibrant than in animation. It just seems so dull in comparison, the original did a good job of portraying a more vibrant oceanic world."
The books will read: “The racism flowed from their words and actions when they saw a red haired black fictional character. Such dumbfucks”
Ah yes. Haters gonna hate.
"Man, I don't care. Make *every* character black. Make every character *blue*. I'm older than ten, so I'm obviously never going to go see The Little Mermaid. Are there really that many adults out there with the desire to debate the casting for some kid movie? For fuck sake!"
"That people actually get this worked up about a literal *CHILDREN'S MOVIE* is shameful.

I disagree with what Disney did here, but in the end I don't care. Likely it'll be as bad as the other Disney remakes. 

I just hope she can sing, Little Mermaid has some nice songs :)"
"Oh man people have time to whine and winge

This is for grade school kids who haven’t seen this before and it’s fun and exciting for them in the way, luke I am yo fatha was for many of us."
"First of all, I don't care that she is black, I love it, I love little girls cheer cuz their hero looks like them. It is so important and incredible, and heartwarming. 

What I am upset about is that Disney DIDNT NOT PREDICT THAT THIS KIND OF OUTRAGE WOULD UNFORTUNATELY HAPPEN AND PUT A BEAUTIFUL TALENTED YOUNG LADY IN HARMS WAY. They had to know this would happen and they tossed her to the wolves, just like the industry has been doing to young girls for years. Her skintone generates conversation and free marketing??? SHAME ON DISNEY FOR SUCH EXPLOITATION. This is what I am outraged about and this is what I think everyone should analyze and consider. She was done dirty. Years later we will look at this and finally see the horror we collectively put her through.We can make it better now. This is why I still can't justify giving my money to Disney.

And this is for sure a marketing strategy because now there is a choice, you can go watch a movie to support  HB and make it better for her and do exactly what Disney wants you to do and give them money... or is what majority choose will do nothing and then this big thing will crush and burn and bury her under itself. Or you can write a chaotic weird angry post somewhere where people will see it and say that we need to stop bullying a young lady, and maybe be kinder to her online, while telling Disney that they need to do better or their business will suffer.

I hope i got my point across. My heart is breaking for this young lady. Someone please put it in better words than me, I am not eloquent enough

Let's do better. It was us who had been watching and aiding in exploitation of young people, men and women by the industry. We saw Britney break down and lose hee freedom, we saw Vanessa H apologizing for having her private vulnerable pictures be posted by a person she trusted, we watched these girls be ruined and we should not let this happen again."
"This sucks. I think the live action Disney remakes have been mostly terrible, and I have zero desire to see this. I have to now, tho, because I won’t be associated with those idiots who complain about a black mermaid"
I saw black girls reacting to her skin tone and loved it.
"I've seen videos of black girls excited by black Ariel. It makes me happy. But I'm still sad for childhood me, who was so excited to see myself in Ariel as a red-haired girl, and I don't see that anymore. She was my favourite princess solely because she looked like me. 

Because of that, I understand the joy black Ariel brings, but it still makes me sad that they rebranded an established character instead of making a new one for black girls to see themselves in."
"Maybe I’m weird, I’ve never hit the dislike button on a YouTube video.  If it sucks, I skip it"
It the trailer genuinely getting so many dislikes because they have cast a black actor as Ariel? Am I missing something?
"I wish it were possible to tell without seeing them which of these soulless retreads or multimedia franchise aportionings were actually bad versus those that offend the sensibilities of terminally online chuds, but alas"
"I'm shocked to see how many people just hate the idea that a fictional character has a different skin colour.

It's notmonly Arielle, but any show, series, game or movie as off lately. And it's not just the US but Germany as well afaik.

What's wrong with people, why the hate?"
I think this also counts for ring of power
Race isn't an issue anymore. We've solved Racism.
"Is it just misguided parents hating on Ariel, or do adults actually care about Disney films this much?"
"Crazy, all the adults getting mad while the kids are just hyped for another kids movie. That always seems to be how it goes."
the Brandy version of Cinderella remains the best live action Disney movie ever made - holding out hope for this remake because it’s the SINGING that made the Brandy Cinderella amazing and I’m assuming it will be the singing that makes this version of Ariel amazing
It's all the Hans Christian Anderson fans.  They hate to see his work altered.
People are really dense about something that doesn't even matter.
One of the shortest trailers ever and the whole fucking world is in a uproar for a girl playing a mythical creature.... One day someone will call out this metal illness among human beings so fickle
why do people care Lol just don't watch it
Or just watch the old animation if you can’t handle change.
Let me cry because they changed an insignificant aspect of a movie I haven’t thought about in 20+ years.
"Excuse me but i don't get it,why does it matter if the character of a movie/videogame/cartoon is not white? Why does it matter so much? I mean i don't care what color or ethnicity that character is as long as the movie is interesting to watch,if a movie has a good story and interesting characters i will love the movie and the characters in that movie and i will praise that movie story writing. But if a movie will have an awfull story writing it won't matter the character colour of skin,it will be simply be unliked by me personaly because of the story writing and plot story.Is this really an issue? I mean we are all humans,no matter the colour of our skin,we bleed the same way the same red blood and we get hurt in the same way.why does it matter so much if a fictional madeup mermaid by Walt disney should be only white,heck when i was young and i have watched the Mermaid Ariel for the first time my parents TV colors were messed up and for me the mermaid was not white but pink and i remember that i said:' woah that pink mermaid is cool'."
Again Disney Adults are 100% normal and aren't racist that the disliked bombed a video cause the fictional mermaid wasn't a white chick.
Shame that this is such a big deal now but no one was losing sleep over the black Cinderella Disney film in the 90s.
I can’t wait to show my support and watch it with my kids
There have been a million non-White Cinderellas. I truly don’t understand why people are gatekeeping the ethnicity of princesses all of a sudden. Besides the fact that HB is perfect for the role. I can’t remember ever being more excited to see a movie.
Guarantee it's a bunch of racist people lol
"I do not see the point in any of these remakes at all. They’re inevitably inferior, lacking any of the charm of the original and as most are shot for shot remakes, they end up like Gus Van Zant’s Psycho remake by virtue of being pointless."
"I'm 100% supportive of diversity in media, but this is just wrong.  Ariel has always been a red headed white mermaid, this change feels forced and un sincere.  My daughter will ultimately watch when it comes out but she has already asked why they changed Ariel."
So I guess people are talking about the fact that she is black but they are clearly missing the bigger issue. Disney actively chose to cast an actress that isn’t a real mermaid. This is appropriation and we need to stand up for the mermaids.
"Aka the perfect ""am I a racist test"" with thousands properly Identified..."
"The great thing abound using a black actress is that they knew the movie would be shit just like all their other live action remakes, but they can use “racism” as a deflection for valid criticism. Just like they did with “homophobia” and Buzz Lightyear"
It’ll never happen I know but I wish people would stop giving any attention to these lazy nostalgia cash grabs Disney keeps pumping out.
"I refuse to entertain this.

The movie is going to be shit but it will not be because Ariel is black. It will be because it is recycled garbage made to make parents feel nostalgic and children to feel like they are watching something new.

It is Hedge Fund cinema and all that matters is the bottom line, art be damned.

That is why studios like A24 resonate with people... independently owned and artist driven."
"As far as I'm concerned, Ariel only has 2 traits that are actually important to get right.
1. She’s a good singer.
2. She makes bad decisions and has her king father or prince husband deal with the consequences for her."
No wonder. I’m tired of expressive cartoons being replaced with non-expressive cgi bs.
The trailer made me realize how weird a live action little mermaid is. It looked like the trailer might have shown flounder and it looked kinda weird. We still haven't even seen sebastion.
Not everyone acting like they issue is live action
1/3 of this country are openly and proudly racist garbage.
"It’s a story about a minority outsider nearly being enslaved at sea, who is literally silenced when she tries to enter society.

And y’all are acting surprised that a black woman is playing her."
"Idc who Ariel is but i give a big damn about who's playing Ursula, Melissa McCarthy?  Come on now, don't do the best disney villian like that.  I don't think i can watch her butcher that roll"
It’s called racism
Lots of butthurt racists out there
People outraged about a black mermaid with red hair should boycott scooby doo for having a talking dog. They’re fucking pretend cartoon characters people.  Jeez!
"Remember folks, woke = ""contains a black and/or queer character""."
"Aw. The angry white dudes who..... would never watch Any Mermaid shit. 
This is getting annoying"
Pretty sure it’s just racism tbh
I don't  care that  the little  Mermaid  is black. I'm  annoyed that  its yet another remake rather than an original  film. I would like another original  film with a black princess - like the princess & the frog.  Race swapping is just lazy imo. So though i don't  think its the end of the world - i don't  think its progress either. Its just lazy.
"They can be mad all they want, but the director specifically said NO ONE auditioned as well as Halle, therefore she deserves the part. Race means absolutely nothing to the source material, why would they only only let white girls audition?"
"""Sorry black children, we can't give you your own work to be proud of. We just can't put money behind something made from the ground up by black people. All we can do is give you an inferior version of a movie that didn't need to be remade. Be happy with what you get.""

This is the future of the entertainment industry: Create bland works that are either remakes/reboots or bland continuations of original works and include 'representation' so that they can justify it to the public and call anyone who dislikes it a bigot. 

It's so condescending and cynical, and it fucking works. Disney as a company is truly a disgusting example of late stage capitalism, and yet they have managed to get the average person, even those on the far left, to support them. The astroturfing has worked."
"Guilty here for disliking it. 

I have nothing against her nor representation but this is just another *We can't come up with an original idea So we are gonna race/gender change the original character to shove the diversity up your ass* Movie. WHICH I FUCKING DESPISE."
It’s a movie for kids and adults keep being AHs.
"Nobody gives a shit about the color of a Disney fish lady. 

People are tired of effortless remakes that pander and exploit race (“Hey, let’s make a black version of the Little Mermaid. The black audience will love that shit), and further flame racial tensions when the movie turns into a flop (“They hated our idea. Let’s just blame it on race—not a shitty remake—and recoup our losses through public support).

Hire some fucking writers and make something awesome and new—like The Frog Princess. That was awesome and original."
What’s with all these adult men giving a damn about who stars in a movie for little girls?
"This movie is going to be a huge hit because people, in general, love to support the underdog. 

I for one will see this movie in theatre just to spite the haters."
"I’m not going to watch this movie, but not because the mermaid has colored skin. Seriously who gets mad that a fantasy creature has dark skin. 

People need to focus on the real problems. Like climate change destroying the world we live on."
Racism alive and well in America.
"Me not knowing there was even a little mermaid trailer: nice, downvote that shit

Me reading the reason: wait no-"
"So 104,000,000 views * 1% = 1,040,000.  Less than 1% dislikes.

What the fuck are we even talking about?"
We know why it was downvoted.
To all the people who think the actress was chosen because of the color of her skin: the director even stated that Halle was the first one to audition and she set the bar so high that no one came close. The best actress got the job.
The movie looks fine.
"Factually speaking, the only thing we know about her skin from the original story (by Hans Andersen) is that she didn't have any blemishes (e.g. no acne), so anyone complaining about her skin color is just wrong."
Why hire a human actress? They should have gotten a real mermaid to play the part. Dumb Disney
"I don't get why adaptations have to change things, all I want when things get adapted is to have a 1 to 1 thing in a different format but there always have to be some twists or changes... What's the point of making an adaptation then, this shit is going rampant right about now with IPs getting butchered just so the adaptations can be unique, just make new stories at that point. 

This isn't going to be any better then WoT or Witcher or any other adaptations we got lately, I bet they are going to change the whole plot by the halfway mark and all it will have in common with little mermaid is going to be that it takes place underwater if even that stays..."
"So I just watched this with my daughter (4, Germany, knows the original movie). Her comments were: turtles! / look there‘s Ariel / why did she stop singing?

She’d give it a thumbs up."
Honestly. Who gives a fuuuuuuck?!
Fan Baiting = free publicity.
"Thousands? More like a million. 

This movie gonna be a banger."
"Adults argue over the color of the Little Mermaids skin or the fact Disney keeps putting out live action remakes of their older movies.

Ever stop to wonder who these movies are supposedly made for? Kids. And the videos I’ve seen of young black girls being so excited that the Little Mermaid looks like them is all the satisfaction I need. Obviously Disney is out to make money and there are plenty of things we can criticize them about. This isn’t one of them imo."
"Americans claim they're not racist, yet no other nation in the world is that obsessed with race.

No matter where they are on the political spectrum, they can't help it but see everything through the prism of race."
Why does it matter what skin colour she has? Does Ariel’s skin colour have any impact in the story?
My Facebook was full of racist comments and jokes. I've uninstalled Facebook.
"I feel like this will get spun as ""it is because she is black"" and just skip over the fact that not a single Disney live action remake has even been on par with the original. Most people don't give a fuck what skin color she is just stop with the live action crap they suck. Beauty and the beast, the jungle book, Aladdin etc etc etc. They all are heartless soulless remakes especially the lion king."
"I think, that when Hollywood knows they are bout to make a stinker, they find a person of color to insert so they can say the bad reception is due to racism. Sometimes."
Should we tell these same people that Jesus was Middle Eastern or nah?
"“im not mad that she’s black, i just-“ bro stfu this is a kid’s movie. this is not for reddit, this is for real children, not man children"
"I don’t care if she’s black, asian, Latina or white. I just don’t like the actress playing her. She straight up looks weird.

She does have a nice voice though, so I’m torn."
Tbh the little mermaid being pale white at sea never made any fucking sense to me. Like not even a tan
"Conservatives: “Racism ended in the 60s, Liberals are the real racists for continuing to talk about it, I’m colorblind!”
Also conservatives: Desperately trying to list reasons they dislike this that don’t involve race."
"Let me guess Disney, it’s the racist trolls right? But nothing to do with the low quality of lack of soul in these remakes?"
If you are an adult and cry about a mermaid movie having a black actress you are the biggest fucking loser ever. Complete waste of life.
Racists are obvious far more common than people seem to realize.
"I saw a supercut of a bunch of different young black girls seeing this trailer and literally crying in disbelief that Ariel looked like them. 

It was beautiful and heartbreaking. 

I’d love to know what these racist fucks are thinking if they were to see something like that."
"Can’t wait for Mexican Snow White, and Chinese Pocahontas"
I find it absolutely fascinating that so many white men in their 40s have suddenly taken such a vocal interest in a children’s movie about a singing mermaid that they were never going to watch in the first place.
"It'd be more exciting if there wasn't already the same movie, made in a more vibrant and creative style, with the same songs and story, that's been out over 30 years.

You know how sometimes they remake really old movies and the dull, flat style gets updated to a more colorful and exciting one? These Disney remakes are the reverse of that."
It wasnt really a trailer. Lol. It looks like another shitty cgi “live action” mess of a remake
I won't be surprised when the actress comes back in a year and admits she received thousands of death threats from angry fans
Gonna watch it just to piss off racist pricks.
"Is this the future? Seeing articles about wokeness, dislikes, and viewership instead of discussing shows and movies?   
It wasn't this bad a few years ago. How do you guys not get tired of these articles?"
"Honestly my only issue is her hair isn't vibrant enough for Ariel's hair.

&#x200B;

She really reminds me of Jasper Spellman from that god awful Marlon Wayans film Sextuplets.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I'm still convinced 90% of Marlon Wayan's films are tax write offs"
"It’s a great trailer, just saying."
"How dare they not make a fictional, imaginary being blue or green.  How dare they…"
Wtf nobody cared when Brandy was Cinderella and Whitney was the fairy godmother. They were wonderful and this girl will be as well. I’m so excited to see this movie.
I like her; she carries the right vibe.
Yikes. Another thread full of small pp energy
"“The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as lost viewed trailer with thousands of racists disliking it because they take offense to the skin color of a mythological species.”

Fixed it for you."
"So if I check the comment history of the people who are upset over a black girl playing Ariel, I'll find similar concern over white-as-fuck Rooney Mara playing Tiger Lily in *Pan*, right?"
Racist pieces of human trash who I’m willing to bet will still see it
White talent has been used to portray minorities (and not always in flattering ways) for decades.  Now the shoe is on the other foot and people are outraged?  Get bent.
"As a white person, it’s sad when the racists come out of their little hole and whine and cry when a character isn’t played by a white actor."
There sure are some petty bitches in this world
Dislikes almost exclusively from sadbrained racists
Proving America is the most racist country & the most ignorant 2 boot
"I can't wait to see the scores of people who declare that this is literally the Holocaust because ""It's not in keeping with Hans Christian Andersen's vision.""

Get rekt, racist fucksticks."
I love all this anger. Good to see the racists outing themselves.
Idk how people see the race swap. Isnt mermaid her race? Isnt she still mermaid??
"Her voice is beautiful, we haven’t even seen the kingdom yet, they’ve worked on this for over 3 years, I’m sure it will be nice"
Well I know where I'm headed with a big ole LIKE! Let's drown that shit right out. Racist ignorant oxygen thieves...smh
Fuck the haters! Watching young kids lose their adorable little minds over the trailer made my heart explode with happiness. I can’t wait for this release.
"Oh my god, her voice. I wasn't excessively excited for this, but now I'm interested!"
I think it’s great how many of you watched the trailer.
Meanwhile motherfuckers could give two shits the planet is dying.
Thousands? Currently sitting at 1.6 MILLION dislikes with less than 600k likes.
"The real shame in this is it is the cheapest, most disingenuous form of base appeasement they could possibly take. Look Ariel isn’t white anymore! Look how far we’ve come and how good we are. Meanwhile nothing of real importance changes. Education sucks. Economy sucks. Opportunities nonexistent. Drugs and crime everywhere. But thank our lucky stars Ariel isn’t white anymore…"
All they had to do was to make it a different character than Ariel.
Hot take: Anybody who strongly cares about this in any way spends too much time online.
"I'm sure there have been horrible people making horrible threats, but from my gentle, naive perspective that hasn’t heard of that stuff yet I feel like this is the way culture wars should play out.  Spirited debate and people smashing dislike buttons or proclaiming they won’t go see it or making tictoks about their daughter crying when they see it.

No medical rights being trammeled on, no mass shootings (yet), no book burnings.

  I’m sure it will get out of hand, but spirited debate is an art we have lost as a society and in some ways this kind of reminds me of it because at the end of the day it’s just a movie you don’t habe to go see if you don’t want"
Wow people are still racist? No way
The part where Ariel identified as a combat submarine is my fav
"I personally cannot understand what is wrong with people, if you are that sensitive that a color of a person playing a made up fantasy charatar can make your mad like this, then stay of the internet"
"I dislike Disney as a whole. For it's whole life Disney has been racist, sexist and every -ist you can imagine. But once they realized their bigotry was loosing them money they suddenly changed, but only on the outside.


10 years ago if this movie was remade Ariel would be white. All I see now when I see Disney's ""inclusion"" of the things they hated. All I see is $$$, because that's all they're doing it for. 


For clarification. Disney has not changed. All they want is your money so they'll pander to you to make you think they changed. Don't support a company that will suddenly change their views to make others happy, usually they only want your money. Disney is scum really."
"They need to stop milking the old Disney movies... The originals will always be better, no need to make live actions."
"I mean the constant live action remakes suck. With the exception of Jungle Book IMO. But considering the character isn’t even human, what does it matter what her race is? Do mermaids even have races? It’s like getting upset about a black werewolf or an Asian ghost.."
People are weird. Im just happy for more disney movies
Disney adults have racists in their midst? You don’t say?
What a bunch of cry babies and spoiled children these people who are hitting the dislike because of the colour of a fictional characters skin.
This movie is going to make a lot of money and people angry at the color of the fictional mermaid are going to be sooo sad
"The more dislikes it gets, the more it shows why it's needed."
"This is actually a genius tactic by Disney tbh

No one would even be talking about this movie if they cast some random white American. Now they got everyone coming out of the woodwork cause they blackwashed Ariel"
"So many grown adults pissed about this movie, whether it’s “race swapping” or “NoT AnoThER LiVe rEmaKE”. Bottom line is the main target audience is children."
"I love that every dislike adds engagement pushing it further to the top and driving more ad revenue. Keep clicking, ya racist fucks."
I don't care that she's black she just looks really weird in the trailer tbh
Racists love to downvote on social media
"I think that's just the norm now, if it's off white a dedicated sphere of people will actively try to spike it."
"wait, but people have been telling me that Racism is over? You're saying the issue is complex and the problem systemic and ubiquitous in the USA?"
Imagine getting on the internet to simp for a fucking Disney live action movie.
"Good. If they wanted to do this, they should of made her a different mermaid branched off the story, even featuring Ariel. Making Ariel black was just a poor taste idea. Yeah she’s a mermaid, but she’s not portrayed black. Cope."
Do we just get mad when we whitewash things? I never know anymore. I wish Disney would dive into its massive catalogue and use its black characters to give them light and show how awesome some of them are. Other than race swapping and just calling everyone some type of ist. I really don’t care one way or the other. But I put 5 on it this will suck bc these live action remakes usually do. Hopefully it tho.
Look at all them racists.
How to say you’re racist without saying you’re racist.
The same people upset about the idea of a black mermaid think Jesus looked like Bradly Cooper.
Why did this cartoon movie need to be re-made anyway? I really don’t like when they remake movies. Are there no other new ideas out there where they could make a person of color the main character? I find re-makes lazy . Give us some new content.
"It's amazing people get so worked up over something that isnt real.

Wait till they find out Jesus wasn't white."
"I acknowledge many people have valid criticisms of the trailer and the directions the film appears to be going in—or even just the fact Disney keeps churning out this live action crap. I myself fall intro this category.

But let’s not pretend that the reason that it’s the most disliked trailer or whatever is down to these valid criticisms. It’s because the actress is black and people are racist. It’s that simple. I know I wouldn’t be going out of my way to dislike a trailer just because I find I’m not a fan of its direction, etc. Racists, however? They love to go out of their way to express their hatred however they are able."
"The lighting is so dark? It just seems kinda.. Dingy.


Given that's it so dark, would that mean there is little sunlight?

Shouldn't she have low melanin levels, then?"
"It’s all the maga trolls who are triggered by literally everything.  I’m not surprised at all they would come in droves to hate on a movie trailer.  The film looks great imo, can’t wait to see it!"
"I was initially angry that they cast a black actress to play Ariel. At first I didn't know why. The best I could figure is that I was angry that disney made another flagrant attempt at social justice virtue signaling wokeness.

I then started to read the YouTube comments to see what other people were saying. Some happy. Some angry. 

I then stumbled on a comment from a black girl. She was so happy they cast a black actress to play Ariel. She seemed like it genuinely made her day. 

I was so happy for this little girl I forgot what all the fuss was about."
"So if someone at Disney suggests a new idea for a movie, as in an original idea never done before...do they get like strangled or something? Why would anyone want to see a new Little Mermaid movie?"
And behind every dislike is a racist prick
Its fine that she’s black.  It’s not fine that these live-action remakes are almost always garbage.
"I don't really care that Ariel is black, but I also don't really understand why it was important to make her black, or if it even was important. She's got a great face for the role; all big eyes and her nose looks spot on. I'm not sold on her voice in the trailer. The added high note and vocal roll leads me to think we are going to get some diva singer version of the songs and thats a bit of a shame. I guess I just wonder if she was the best person who auditioned, or if it was decided that Ariel would be black and then they went from their. If it's the former, then I'm all for it. If it's the latter then not so much.  It's a kids movie, I'm not going to lose any sleep over it either way. But in the larger scheme of things I'm generally not thrilled about a billion dollar company changing established characters to score diversity points. I would say just write new stories, but given that disney cant write anything halfway decent these days I can see how that might not work out. I'll wait to pirate it and see, I suppose."
I think we need to remake The Bernie Mac Show and recast Bernie as a white guy
"Who knew it would take elves, dwarves, and mermaids for nearly half the country to show its racism?"
"Let's be honest about the ppl who think this is a stupid thing to get mad about...

Were you saying this when ppl were mad about ScarJo playing in Ghost in the Shell?

Or about Rooney Mara playing in that Peter Pan movie?

Of course, you probably were agreeing with those ppl being mad... so just say what you really mean: white ppl, even historical ppl, being replaced in movies/tv with non-white actors is fine to do, the reverse is wrong."
Stop fucking acting like the casting choice of ariel wasn't specifically done for diversity purposes. Hollywood has been replacing redheaded characters with black people for years-if you're still denying that they're doing it on purpose you're fucking delusional
It must be so embarrassing to be white in America right now if you aren't crazy.
We know the demographic that is doing that it’s really pathetic
Go to r/mademesmile and watch the clips of little black girls in tears with how happy to see an Ariel that looks like them. And then still complain about the skin color of a mermaid. You racist bastards.
I see the loser brigade is at it again. Getting mad about things that don’t effect them at all.
"What a beautiful voice she has! *Whispers in ear*  ""A  schwarze? Oy vey!"
"I could give a less of a hoot about the color of Arieals skin. I want an end to these terrible live action repeat cashgrabs of belowed 2D animated films and shows companies are pushing out. Its insulting to think these movies exist simply because this trend of making ""realistic"" renditions of intellectiol properties is making so much money, not one of these companies would have dug up any of their intellectual properties for a movie had it not seemed profitable for them and even less likely would they have spent a second thinking of making any new animated ones. Its almost worse than just solely making 3D films."
It doesn’t look that bad. Sure it won’t be as good as the original but it will be serviceable.
Read the comments. This looks like obvious botting.
Ultimately - the box office will be decider if people are ready for this
i dislike all disney live action versions so far except cinderella
Black skin makes more sense because white mermaid would get sunburnt very fast. At the very least the mermaid should have a dark tan.
"Is it all because the actress playing Ariel is black?  If so, fuck all those racist assholes.  This is an adaptation of a cartoon where race was in no way, shape, or form a key plot point of the story.  She could be white, black, brown, anything.  Literally has no impact on the plot.  I only care at all about the demographics of casting choices if the demographics are a key aspect of the plot.  The only thing that’s key about the little mermaid is that she has the lower half of a fish.  That’s it.  Something that would be fair to get upset about is if they decided to switch which part is fish vs humanoid.  Like if she had nice lady legs and everything from the waist up was a tuna I’d have a little trouble with that, but this?  Literally doesn’t matter.  What could Ariel being black possibly take away from the movie?  

If they are mad because Disney seems to just be cranking out shitty live-action remakes of movies that were never meant to be live action, that’s justified.  I thought the “live” action lion king movie was a giant disappointment, and have no desire to see any of these others remakes."
"Funny how white ppl can give a scientific and sociological history of why black ppl can’t exist In a specific Fictional world, but then don’t underatnd how systematic racism is real."
I wish she was blacker!
And if you want your heart lifted watch all the reaction shots of all the little black and brown girls squealing with joy
Ok but this movie (like all of the live-action remakes) looks absolutely atrocious
"I gotta say I dont like these types of castings usually BUT when its something like this where it's an ancient story with hundreds of adaptations then the whole point which is to do something different every time. 

If its Johnny Storm or Archie or whatever I get it, those characters exist in a specific way. But fairy tales? They're basically fables. You should aim to tell it differently every time for sure."
People be racist
I mean come on dude. This shit ain't right. Her hair needs to be red.
"I was like...""WHY is Halle Berry playing the little mermaid?"""
"You don’t want to watch it because you’re racist

I don’t want to watch it because i don’t want to watch another soulless Disney remake 

We are not the same"
"I'm just done with Disney Live Action Remakes. They suck. The writing adaptation sucks, the music sucks, they don't have the same magic as the original animations - is this movie even gonna have talking animals? Like, are they gonna repeat the Lion King fiasco where the animals were so emotionally bland for the sake of ""realism""? Can't imagine that'll go well with Flounder.

Seriously they just need to do something original. Even Disenchanted looks fresh in comparison - and it's a sequel!"
"If you dislike giving millions of children, who haven't ever felt fully included , genuine joy , then you are a monster and need to be placed under lock and key"
MAGA scum like to review bomb movies. Let the smart people decide.
"As insulting as race changes are, this whole thing looks like a low budget disaster. But if they wanted a diverse princess (which is clearly what this is all about) they should have gone with princess and the frog which, by the way, would have been way more interesting to watch live action than this."
"I know it’s assumed that the dislikes are due to the race change, but what if it’s just the fact that people are sick of the remakes and nostalgia-bait? I know I am!"
Is Disney ever planning on actually making something new or are they just going to keep cramming 5000 remakes down our throats
Kinda fucked how they took the only ginger princess
"Wow!  What if they replaced Tiana with a white woman? Now That would blow my mind. This? Now this is just expected.

They could have at least replaced her with a black AND gay person to get double points."
To be honest I believe that only tiny amount of these dislikes were due to the actress. I think most of it is due to the fact that people are fed up with the remakes from Disney.
"I really don't care about who's playing her, and it's disappointing to see so much hate surrounding the skin color of an actress. What should be mentioned though, is that this trailer just sucks, regardless. Nothing happens, we see a wave, some fish swimming and a girl looking up to the top of the ocean singing three lines of text. I was really hoping the trailer would spark any potential interest in me to watch the movie, but it didn't. And therefore, deserves a dislike."
"People still want to pretend the review bombing of LOTR had nothing to do with racism too, eh?"
Her eyes look like they're running away from her nose lol
Who gives a fuck what color a made up character is .
I didn't know racists felt so strongly about...The little mermaid???
"For everyone pretending review bombing is not happening and the outrage is about Disney not inventing a new story and instead swapping race or gender in an existing story: look up early reviews for other (original) movies/games/tv series with POC and/or female leads that came out the last few years: Eternals, Captain Marvel, Black Widow, Lucy, Kate, Batwoman, *Honk For Jesus. Save Your Soul*. 

Now do the same for sequels or reboots like The Last Jedi, The Last of Us II, Ghostbusters (2016). This is not a singular ""Lazy Disney"" problem!

And for those who go the obtuse ""what if they'd made Black Panther white"" route: Black Panther was a major victim of review bombing as well! And the negative comments and dislikes for the trailer of its sequel don't bode well either...

Oh well, we'll see what the early audience scores for The Woman King will be, but since negative reviews cannot possibly be about insecure incels being scared of strong women or people of color, they'll be as positive as the current critic scores, right? Right?!"
The racists coming out of the woodwork.
"White republicans are still assholes.  Next up on tonight's news, experts say the sun is likely to rise tomorrow, again, and the day after as well."
"As a pale red headed girl I loved Ariel growing up. She was my idol. I do wish she looked like me but honestly I don’t watch Disney live action anyway, it’s their IP, and I saw a lot of little black girls are happy about it. It’s for kids anyway so if they like it then it’s okay with me. In the end it doesn’t affect me. I just hope her hair is a brighter color! It looked very dim in the trailer and I feel red hair is a hallmark of the character. The skin color doesn’t matter much. The dislikes are stupid."
"I'm probably dumb, I did watch the trailer but why does it look like she has no eyebrows?"
That’s a lot of adult men upset over a fairy tale for little girls.
"I can’t help but chuckle at the idea of these idiots being so impotently enraged about this that they get a modicum of satisfaction from clicking dislike. These people do realize that mermaids are fictional, right?  That means they’re all the colors. Just tell them it’s in the bible. They’d have to read it to find out…"
"My dislike, is that they’re doing live action remakes to begin with. Make something new…."
black people monetizing the racism of white people is the future
Everyone knows mermaids in real life are white.  This is racial appropriation…….
This is so sad for me. The new little mermaid is beautiful. I'm happy Disney is doing this.  I see this as a beautiful positive thing.
"Only a couple thousand dislikes? 

More like 1.3 million lmao"
So racists are angry? Fine by me. It's when they are happy that I get worried.
"I don’t think this is as much about the actor being a different race or anything, im just so tired of Disney relying on live action remakes of beloved films that have been worse every single time"
Fuck you racists
"Ah, bigots.

Fuck them all"
This just in: lots of shitty racists have internet access.
Was there this severe of a reaction when Rodger's and Hammerstein's Cinderella came out?
So many racists. Wow. At least those cockroaches are now put in the light where it's easier to stomp on them.
"Idk if the people who are pushing the ""they should've given this opportunity to a REAL [a.k.a. white] redhead"" argument think that us pasty gingers appreciate it or something, but most of us genuinely do not care that she is black, nor that it isn't her actual hair color. It's not like there was outrage when Scarlett Johansson started dyeing her hair red/wearing wigs for Black Widow.

As if there aren't black redheads out there, too. It's all so stupid."
"Taking an issue with the skin color of an actress playing a character from a fairy tale is the dumbest hill to die on. Fine, maybe it’s all a big cash grab from Disney to expand the audience, but who is it hurting? No one."
"Can’t we all just get along and quit bitching about every damn thing. It looks like a phenomenal movie and I, for one, will thoroughly enjoy watching it while giving zero fucks about whether Ariel is black or white."
Yea. It’s the woke folk. Nothing better to do
"I’ll keep saying this on every thread I see about this movie. Ariel should always have been a person of color. I get it, HCA was from Denmark and he never saw a black person before or whatever, but telling this story in the modern age, it makes much more sense for Ariel to be a POC. It’s a story about two different worlds clashing and a forbidden love, why not visually depict the characters as from diverse cultures? This should always have been an interracial relationship."
Bigoted piece of shits
"Somebody actually said ""I hate when they make remakes and ruin the movie."" 

Now my questions in order.

1. Did you complain about any other remakes? and if so please list those remakes that were terrible . 

2. Why is it always a complaint made from a very new account?

3. The trailer only showed a 1:1 recreation of the original movie, with two key differences, 

A) It's live action.

B) Ariel is black. 

How can a movie that you have never seen, be ruined based on these two things? What exactly of these two things is upsetting?"
It's the principle of double standard. Make something new. Dont change something iconic to fit a narrative one way or the other.
Racists are awful
Lotta racists out there.
It looks bad like ALL of the Disney live action movies.
All of the live action Disney remakes should be disliked tbh they are abhorrent.
"The only way Id ever un ironically download and sit 1 hour to watch a  ""little mermaid live action movie"" is if my favorite red head Madelaine Petsch was playing the role, you can take the best looking woman in the world and I still wont watch it because nobody cares about the little mermaid and its not at all interesting"
"Make her black, asian, white again, pacific islander. I don't give a fuck and fuck you if you do."
What a weird title lol
"I love it when adults freak out about kids movies, because the kids that it is made for will watch and enjoy. They don't fucking care about your stupid outrage lol"
"Those 1.5 million aren’t racist, they’re just annoyed at the race swap. It’s so blatant. 

Why couldn’t they create an original black mermaid character? Why did they have to race swap a white character with the same name? Yeah it’s lovely to see all the little black girls eyes light up when they see it, but it’s such a shame they had to piggyback off the success of the previous character. Why not create an original black Disney princess character? And that is a genuine question, I have no idea why 

I saw a photo of Ryan gosling as the next black panther which is also a fictional character, guarantee you it would get the same response."
"Does anyone know why they picked a black actress for a white role? Not hating just curious, it’s just weird to me, I remember my little sister loving this Disney classic, she’s grown and still thinks it’s weird. Who cares if a character is black or white, Ariel was white, why change it?"
Great. Now release the comedy of Robery Downey Jr. playing a Mexican character. Dont half ass on me
"I feel like she was casted to be black for controversy, other than that I don’t not care. I hate seeing this shit on my social media though."
Why the fuck would they.... oh rightrightright out of IPs...
"If your going to remake an iconic movie, don’t change the main role at all. If you want more diversity then add a new supporting character. You know, have an original idea and add value and plot twists to the retelling."
Her hair sucks and her eyes look weirdly spaced.
"good, fuck this woke dogshit they keep pushing"
"Instead of creating something new they chose to be controversial and if you don't agree you are racist , good luck"
"The part where Ariel says ""IT'S MORBIN' TIME!"" really sent chills down my spine"
I haven’t seen incels in his mad since a m&m mascot changed footwear
"X washing existing works and characters for the sake of…. Woke corpo bullshit is always really fuckin dumb.

If they really cared, they’d create a new story and new characters to better represent X demographic Instead of taking the laziest, cheapest route possible because the outrage is basically free marketing."
"There have been videos popping up of black parents showing their little girls reacting to finding out ariel is also black and being so excited. That alone should be enough for these people to realize how important this is for some. casting a black woman as ariel isn’t going to erase the original, but it does make a lot of little girls, who haven’t had much disney princess representation, very happy. I genuinely do not care if it’s just another cash grab because someone’s going to watch this and get that giddy feeling i felt when i saw the original for the first time as a red headed white girl"
"Can’t we just hate Disney for perpetuating the whole “princess” narrative instead of making it a racial thing? 

Girls deserve real role models not fashion models in gender affirming fairy tales."
Why do they always remove red heads?
"I did think the trailer was bad, but all the like racist people are just dumb"
"I don't like that she's black. Yes, blackwashing is an issue that people may care about. Even non racists"
I don't know how anyone can hear her sing in the trailer and not think she was the perfect choice.
Wasn’t ariel white?
Maybe water pollution turned Ariel black
"I don't care about the skin color but it seems Disney is just making bad movies and saying hey remember that good movie we made? Well we made the same movie but we made it worse but this time it has a black person, gay person or (insert diverse person) instead.... Just kinda sad when all we want are actually good movies."
"I don't think Ariel should be cast as black. It's obviously a decision that is born of an ideological agenda. Ariel was written as a white character and there's no reason to change that.

I would be just as against it if a black character were portrayed as a white character - there's simply no need for it.

However, if Ariel being black brings joy to people and it is what people want then I'm happy for it to be made, and for those people to go see it. I'm not required to agree with it though or go see the movie, and feeling this way doesn't make me a racist. I just appreciate story canon and think it should be respected."
"Probably a trash movie but that will get overlooked and applauded for diversity. I'm all for Diversity, just hate when it's forced or manufactured for gain."
I just don’t like that Disney tries to shoehorn diversity into their remakes. It’s lazy pandering. If they want to embrace diversity then they should create original stories that center around diverse cultures and people.
"White washing, woke-washing, it’s all a ploy for people to pick a side and fight about it."
Sad little people
I want to see fresh content from Disney. Tired of all the remakes.
"Yeah idgaf about black Ariel, it’s a Disney movie. LOTR, however, Jesus Christ if you can’t respect the man’s work make your own. Why not create a compelling new fantasy universe with a more diverse cast rather than bastardize a franchise. Oh, because $$ got it."
I hate all this forced diversity. It’s so fake.
"It's not her skin color, she just doesn't look like Ariel.

I could pick out another girl that actually looks like Ariel.

Casting was terrible on this.

Edit

Google, black girl red hair > julia lira red hair

there you go."
Ffs everyone is black now. Waiting for the black smurfs
"All I can say is it's funny how people and media make it a racial discussion when the actual problem is that the character doesn't resemble the character that most people got to know when they were younger. ""But the danish"" stfu, Ariel the mermaid isn't a 100% accurate adaption of the original tale and that's fine, what's not fine is changing the complete look of your character. Imagine a Star Wars episode playing in the timeline of Luke fighting Vader but Vader is now a Satyr with blonde hair and Luke is a Dark Elf. It's not about race, it's about resembling your character from your other movies and tv series."
"I understand that the representation of other cultures and ethnicities has to be done by today’s standards but what was the point of changing race of main character which originally was definitely white, and her look was basically a character symbol? Just asking."
Well we cant white wash things so dont wash already established things with other colors and everyone should be happy?
"And when it flops they will blame everyone for being racist. I'm all for new characters that are black, just come up with a new character so it makes sense. It just comes off as pandering to me otherwise, but whatever. Not like I was going to watch it either way."
You should have just created a new story instead of redoing another old one
Can’t wait until YouTube likes and dislikes are completely irrelevant to the world
"White people be angry.

What's new?"
"People have a right to dislike changes to fairytales they grew up with. This change was not insignificant, it is clearly meant to challenge the status quo. I hope the quality of the movie makes the change irrelevant."
"People cry about a remake changing too much but never consider the fact the original fairy tale books Disney base their movies on has everything changed from book to movie.

People just cry about this because 1 they are racist and 2 they can't let go of nostalgia. You were a dumb ass baby with the brain the size of a pea when you saw the original. Just let new kids enjoy this instead of feeling you have a moral obligation to cry about this movie and tear it to sherds. You're worse than adults with year passes to Disneyland."
Haters gonna hate. Makes me want to watch it even more.
I hope this inspires black kids everywhere to learn how to swim.
I will watch it 5 times to make up for four of those dislikes. This film looks amazing.
"I thought we knew she was gonna be Ariel? Like, isn't this old news? I was excited when it was announced! I don't care about Disney at all, but I'm really sad. Why are people so racist, this is a good thing for little girls!!!"
"I’m not racist, I just don’t like these lazy, shitty live action remakes"
"We need to stop with the race and gender swapping, it's so unnecessary"
I am very offended that the Little Mermaid isn't a transexual man
"Disney execs: “so you say viewer engagement is high? Quick, someone call Lizzo and see if she wants to do Snow White and the 7 average height persons with beards.”"
For the people  mad about the Little mermaid being black google the original Betty boop or better yet just google white appropriation
Racists suddenly out here caring about Disney movies. Why don’t you stop wasting your breath on this and go to war against the GOP for spitefully blocking copyrights to classic Disney characters. Do that instead of being hateful for the sake of being hateful.
"The funny thing is most of the people bitching are never and would never watch it, they just want to bitch for the sake of bitching and to seem relevant and it shows how pathetic their life is. 
Like mate you're 34 and having a sook over a damn kids movie grow up. My 5 year old watch the trailer and didn't even mention the colour of the actress she just said she wanted to watch it."
"Totally understandable… especially since they claimed the mermaid looks EXACTLY the same as in the original. They know they are lying, we know they are lying , they know we know they are lying …"
The racists can eat shit
Why is it that every red head character keeps getting fucked over? This is getting ridiculous and heavily targeted
At this point it must be a marketing strategy by Disney. I haven't heard this much about a princess movie in my entire life.
"Not racist, but why can't we have A black mermaid. As a person of color, I like seeing people myself on television/ movies. It is not racist either since white people probably like seeing white people like themselves on television."
That trailer has been a good indicator of just how casually racist a lot of Americans are.
"Yeah, white people really don't like it when minorities get representation that's not inherently negative."
"Another racism litmus test.
America keeps failing."
Why do these people care so much? Don't like it? Don't watch it. There's still a white version to coddle your fragility.
"I can perfectly well see why. I for one have disliked that trailer more due to the fact that Halle Bailey's pop star singing voice, when she sang that bit of ""Part Of Your World"" with almost a Michael Jackson style has made me cringe. (""Wish I could beeeEEEeheeee..."") REGARDLESS of giving Bailey red hair.

I say this COMPLETELY without racist overtones and more with extreme criticism of Bailey's singing voice. I don't deny that she has a good voice, but it would've been more appropriate for ""Elton John and Tim Rice's Aida"" than ""The Little Mermaid."" What Disney SHOULD have done was particularly people with more classical singing, ideally searching out newcomers from Wales, but noooooooo. This movie is more than just going to be a box office bomb.  It's going to be a box office nuke.

The only good thing about the trailer I'm going to mention is the amazing special effects. Frankly, I'm only going to go to that movie for them, preferably in 3D form, and I swear that whenever Bailey is going to sing, I will be blocking out the music by covering my ears, least I can do in a cinema. Again, I say this without the extremest trace of racism...Disney. Should. Have. Gone. To. Wales. To. Find. A. New. Ariel. Or they should've cast Bella Thorne, the best redhead out there now."
It’s a frigging kids movie. Let kids decide for crying out loud!
"Racist cunts. It’s a MERMAID! Who gives a flying fuck what she looks like! Let it be, god damn."
"i still think they should have made Buzz Lightyear black for the Lightyear movie. 
missed opportunity"
"The amount of hatred people have for black people is appalling.  

I know I’ll get downvoted for this but Just because someone has brown skin does not mean they are a bad person or lesser than somebody who doesn’t have brown skin.

This world is diseased by white supremacy.

I think Disney will make this movie and then make a live action film featuring mostly Aryan actors and that film will end up making tons of money.  they did the same thing with The Princess and the Frog’ there was so much backlash and anger about having a black princess and then they came out with frozen which made a ton of money so they recouped any losses they had for featuring a POC.  

Again the amount of hatred towards Black people is just astonishing.  It’s really eye opening and depressing."
It’s a mythical fucking mermaid. Good lord racists are tiring.
"I don’t have an issue with this at all. I am getting tired of these big studio with all their top notch managers and such. Yet we can’t get new IP at all, little mermaid really didn’t need to be redone. Toy Story 3 should have been the ending (that gosh darn incinerator scene), Boss Baby 2 didn’t need to exist when incredibles needs it third.  Star Wars doesn’t have to be redone. You have the talent and own the technical expertise. Make some new IP so every time people go to enjoy something they aren’t hamstringed by stuff like his 


Make.New.IP."
Fuck all of you white Supremacist.
My beef is that she doesn't look at all like a drawing.
"It's just another instance of fan baiting and race baiting, done by multi billion dollar company in order to make more money."
But mah mermaid history!!!!!!!!!!
"I haven’t seen the trailer, but I have a sneaking suspicion that the fact that Ariel is black in this apparently has played SOME part in the mass dislikes. Always seems to make people pissy when their extremely fictional pieces of work now have a minority as the star of the film."
What is wrong with people?
"Lol you fan bait, you lose."
"I don’t care what race she is, but I do hate the cash grab live action versions of classics. They’re all bad and modernized."
I hate this mivie
"I mean, let's be real; People will hate anything from Disney starring a woman, and anything at all staring a black person."
I believe there is definitely racism involved but some people just didn't like the casting. If you want to do a black little mermaid that's fine but you could've cast Zendaya or someone that would've been great in the role rather than tik tok people.
"If Disney backpedals on this they should be done. Finished. Burn mickey in effigy. Drop Disney+ if you have it. Boycott Disney world (it's garbage anyway). Anything they are affiliated with.

Also fk chik fil a"
"To be honest to me just seeing the reaction videos of black girls, mothers and even grandmothers of seeing a “black Disney princess” for the first time, makes any negative reaction irrelevant"
The racist won’t win this one.
All the dislikes come from the same group against abortion
Thousands of racists
"You’re a fucking racist, we get it. Whatever dumb fucking comment or excuse you try to veil that in doesn’t matter. You’re a piece of shit. (Not directed at you OP…)"
"We get it, y’all hate the new Ariel"
"Lots of racists out there. ""Arial can only be white! How dare Disney change a fictional character they created?! *cries under their hood*"""
What a joke removing dislikes what is this China?
Justice for Gingers lol
"I think people are just tired of freakin remakes. 

  
**HOW ABOUT SOME NEW ORIGINAL STORIES????**"
"Why not just say people don’t like the actor choice because it makes a continuity problem for the series. Similar to how Hermione is black in the cursed child play, not in itself a problem, but odd since there’s 8 movies depicting her as white."
"the dislikes are coming mostly from Disney themselves

Disney funded Anti Gay bill in florida, and cried publically they were pushing pro-gay films.

this is Disney pushing a pro-black movie; what antiblack bill are they funding i wonder.  possibly this one? https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2022/01/florida-sb-148-racism-discomfort"
"A lot of people do not like it when production companies force casting actors/roles from underrepresented groups, especially if it's a historical/established character, or a scenario where they're casting someone of a certain race that would not live in certain location in a certain timeline."
I legit don’t care she’s black at all. Her eyes bug me out. She looks like an alien
Disney wants to be woke but has guns and roses all throughout the new thor movie they have to be trolling at this point
Their marketing tactics work well though
"Idgaf about the little mermaid, id just like disney to stop with the poor live action adeptations and make new stuff. I get its a money faucet but its lame imo"
Pinocchio was bad.
"Personally, I don’t care about the race swap. My issue, is the double standards from Disney. I’m sure they’ll put out a statement in the coming days denouncing racism, yet this is the same company that took their one black character in their Star Wars Sequel Trilogy and diminished him into an ineffective, comedy role. Then, as a further insult, they shrink him in the poster in China.

They want all the positive media coverage without doing all the legwork that comes with diversity."
I can't wait to see what the like/dislike ratio is when we have a white Shaft.
"Go ahead anyone who is even remotely left leaning, says its ""racism"" and ""trolls"" and ignore the fact that disney is using tokenism to sell a garbage minimum effort movie instead of just coming up with a new and actually diverse character."
In my opinion the trailer wasn’t great irrespective of controversies
"I have no issue with the casting, I have issue with Disney doing another remake of a classic movie when they are all objectively worse versions. She could even still he Ariel, just make a different story, I'm begging you."
"Not true! I just checked, and the trailer actually has no dislikes!"
What bothers me the most about this is that Disney is still making live action adaptations of classic cartoons.. just stop. Stop. Leave these alone. All of them.
Is this the next we need to rage at?
"Its always good when companies doing absurd shit like this become a laughing stock. Hi netflix, hi disney."
"who's gonna play her dad tho ?

Edit:I looked it up its Javier Bardem? Idk him he looks funny.  And Melissa mcarthy as Ursula.  Movies gonna bomb.RIP"
More representation the better but this is a movie that didn't need to be made. I'm thinking this is just how Disney holds their IP.
"""Hiding the dislike button will make people press it less"""
"How many dislikes actual MAGA shitbags, vs those just seeking chaos?"
They better not do anything to the Howard Ashman music and lyrics masterpiece.  Any musical changes to TLM would be like changing a Mozart or Bach work.  Don’t do it.
"Oh I didn't know there was a trailer.

I just disliked it! Thanks reddit!"
I mean wasn’t Walt Disney kind of a racist so this tracks.
Now hear me out. It's almost like people don't like blatant hypocrisy.
I want to watch the trailer now just to like it
The tears of these haters nourishes my soul.
"I’ve just watched the trailer now.   

I am appalled that anyone would care one iota that a fucking *mermaid* is black. I genuinely can not comprehend anyone having an issue with this and then putting in the effort to tell the world how much they dislike it. What the fuck is wrong with people? I mean, honestly, if a live action mermaid looked like the cartoon, it would be kinda weird. This actor looks great for the role. 

Frankly, the most brain twisting party of this is how anyone could sing so clearly underwater."
The reaction videos of black kids seeing this area adorable and so wholesome
She’s taking Covid so seriously even her eyes are social distancing from each other
"Why does everything have to be about race? Yes some people dislike the movie because they are racists, others dislike it because it’s not staying true to the source material and some people are tired of Disney turning classics into live action soulless films. 

Stop putting everyone under the racist umbrella!"
Just another ginger erased per usual. Why does everyone hate gingers?
"It’s a little ironic that the trailer is so dim due to scientific accuracy but that would also mean that black skin is impossible without direct sunlight. Lmao, white peoples white guilt is showing so goddamn much. This movie is gonna be ass."
Just why are her eyes so far apart? Isnt that fetal alcohol syndrome?
"Making a black mermaid the lead in a movie is great, my issue is that they are just taking an existing character and changing it's ethnicity. Why not create a brand new one? It's like with Spider-Man. They wanted to have a black Spiderman so instead of just making Peter Parker black, they created Miles Morales who has his own identity and he's freaking awesome."
"Lmao the incels are heated.

That said who gives a fuck about any of these live action cash grabs.  Beauty and the beast was decent but everything else has been soulless and bland.  So unnecessary"
"Dear racists,
It’s time to get back in the closet and lock the door."
So in other words we still have a lot of racists.
"Money, money, money, money, lego money noises"
Racism exists. What else is new.
"#Fuck Ethnicity.....where the fuck is....

#The Little Merman?

#I don't give a fuck if he's white, black, blue, or orange."
"I have to say, the angrier these dumb chuds get about this movie the more I want to see it. Thats a pretty big feat considering the deep seething hatred that I have for an exploitative company like Disney."
"Unpopular opinion. Don’t make white characters poc for the sake of diversity. Make more well done poc characters for the sake of diversity.

A persons race is conveyed through their identity as well as their outward appearance so using the character traits and pre established ideals and identity of a white coded character adds a layer of white washing and doesn’t create an original character that truely resonates with the minority you portray.

It’s why original movies that focus on well portrayed poc characters work so much better. Also enough of old shit rebranded as new shit by redoing it live action or changing one little thing. This imo feels lazy and like Disney doesn’t want to make good representation because it takes too much to talk with people of a minority and get it right. It’s not the first time they’ve done lazy representation. Look their last poc Disney princess movie, raya and the last dragon was such a mishmash of cultural appropriation and an unstructured mess of S.E.A. rep cause They barely had any help from S.E.A. people when creating it.

Sincerely a person of color"
"Look, I don’t care if she was straight up green. Why did they have to pick someone with eyes in two different time zones?!"
"I do wish they had pushed the lighting and color a bit more to be more vibrant, like the cartoon, but that's my only gripe. Everything else is amazing!"
I want to support it and piss these ppl off and make it one of the highest grossing films ever but I kinda refuse to support Disney on their live action remakes of classic animated films
What kinda jerk doesn't like the little mermaid? I swear
Show us your racist without showing us.
I don’t like that they casted a black person to play a white Mermaid.
"Looks good, I’m excited for it."
It's quite ironic since 10 years ago everyone was complaining about whitewashing movies
Would people dislike it at a different rate if they remade Pocahontas as a black chick? What if they made the three stooges black? Why not? Black Pinocchio? You betcha. Black Lion King? Of course! Black Jack Sparrow coming right up! Next we'll do black 101 Dalmations!
"Idc what color they make The little mermaid, this movie seems like a low effort cash grab. I’ve seen a lot more people be critical of this movie cause of the quality of it than people actually mad about the casting, yet all you see on the news is apparently a bunch of racist people are unfairly criticizing it."
"Guys, racism is back"
Disney really has the maga idiots excited.
People need to get the fuck over it.
"As a middle aged white, I would like to point out, mermaids aren't real, and I don't give a shit if they make them rainbow vomit urban camouflage."
I hate that this is now modern marketing.
What a stupid metric. Lmao Jesus christ what a stupid metric.
which is exactly what they wanted with black Ariel. Now everybody is talking about this mediocre washed out remake
The only racism I see are the comments in this thread.
"Mermaids aren’t real.  I imagine she could be green if they wanted her to be.  I would be madder if she wasn’t a redhead, regardless of her skin color."
"This is my first typed sentence about a mermaid movie.

I have actual things to do in my life that aren't about a mermaid movie.

I am so envious of people who apparantly have room to have emotions or lasting opinions or the need to express thoughts about a mermaid movie.

I wish I had the free space for something this trivial.

There's just... too many other actually valid topics to invest mental energy in.

I don't even upvote things I like lmao. Can't imagine extending the required hand energy just to disapprove of a kids movie.

Absolutely extraordinary."
There is absolutely no way this movie is worse than Pinocchio.
"The backlash to inclusiveness and the backlash to the backlash just makes me not trust reviews and ratings at all. The positive thing is that it has helped me move away from going off rating if I should watch something or not. 

Just give it a shot. If you don’t like it, you don’t like it. Move on."
"I’m not a fan, but only because the live action remakes are phoned in. That being said this move made a lot of little girls happy and I’m all for it."
"It’s gonna be awesome fuck these white power motherfuckers. 
- white guy"
"Okay, I have a bone to pick with some of you; specifically, the ""no one asked for this"" camp.

Was there a process where we were *asked* if we ""wanted"" a movie? I don't remember if they ever handed us questionnaires about whether we wanted the LotR trilogy, or Terminator II, or any other movie in existence. We didn't vote for the next movie to be produced.

So when some of y'all are saying ""no one asked for this"", I guess you're technically correct; but no one ""asked"" for any other movies, either. So what on earth are you guys complaining about?"
Are they going to show this movie in china or will they switch the posters and demand an actor change?
Man and I’m just here being sick of Disney making love action films of all their old movies
"I saw the same crappy meme on like a dozen different templates yesterday. The ""They're made the little mermaid isn't white, wait until they find out about Jesus"" ones.

Just screams manufactured outrage to me. Unfunny shit memes like that don't usually circulate their way through the internet that fast organically.

Seems like they don't have a lot of faith in the movie, if they're jumping to doing shit like that immediately to build up publicity."
"I wonder how people would feel about a gender swap lol

Instead of race swapping characters that where originally white, why not introduce new stories with new characters that may be minority ethnicity? Imagine how people would feel if Disney took a black character and race swapped to white. I know that cannot happen today cause there still exists racism and Disney is doing its part such as this to address and fight it. I just think it would be more authentic to introduce new great characters. As we see here people are cynical when you take a white character and make it black, it feels more like a political statement then the actresses merits or story 

You just know when they were casting for this role they knew it wasnt going to be a white person"
Probably red heads feeling discriminated against.
"disney be like: ""oh cool look at all these views!"""
"Maybe one day Disney will stop making shitty live action remakes of their classics, and make original films

Ha, just kidding. Who's ready for the shit storm when the Robin Hood remake comes out though?"
"Just another film I'll just pirate for my nieces if they want to watch it. I'm not giving Disney my money for this low effort.

Looks like a horror film, girl doesn't look like Ariel.

Keep her black, but where's the lighting jfc"
"I hate forced diversity. It’s so fake. There’s a right way to do it, that black kid in stranger things. He fits right on, even falls in love with the redhead. Perfect. There needs to be a backstory. Triton and the sisters better all be black or else….!!"
"The only problem of this movie is that it is another generic live action movie noone asked that milks on nostalgia of already masterful 2d animation movies that didn't need remakes, specially sucks in the case of live action remakes since this implicitly states that realism and live action is superior that ""childish"" 2d traditional animation"
I don’t see why people are so upset about her look being unrealistic for a mermaid. They’re focused on really insignificant things like hair and skin color. Her eyes are so far apart she’s practically a hammerhead shark.
"I think people are making this too much about race when really I think the majority of people are just over these live action Disney remakes… 

It’s also the less obvious changes that are irritating. Why did they take away her freaking sea shell bra? Why is the hair not red enough? Why is the tail not green enough? etc."
That publicity picture is not doing the movie any favors she looks exactly like she is at the bottom of a toilet… in NY Central Park
"I bet Disney was thinking how to remake another movie and one of the employees said…why don’t we make her black.They were all looking at eachother and thinking that’s brilliant,we will make so much money"
"I wish Disney would stop pandering, it'd be fine if they cared and put in an effort. Why is it another movie with completely washed out colors. Like yeah it's nice they recast some actors as poc since they refuse to make new stuff they are kinda out of other options but are they trying to make diverse movies unlikable?

Also why is the article quoting Matt Walsh if you ever make an argument and feel a need to quote him you probably made a bad argument. For his arguments to make sense you gotta believe that history started when you were born and like ffs he is qt-ing that black kids are more violent etc, like come on find a less racist person for a quote."
"Disney needs to stop doing these remakes. I don't care who plays Ariel, Aladdin, Lion King, Snow White, whoever. They're all trash. Went from fantasy fun adventures for kids to these clear cash grab, visual spectacle, re-telling of the same dang stories."
"It is weird that all the undersea people(aquaman, namor), people who would be exposed to very little light and would be extremely pale, are the characters they chose take liberties with. The reason white people are ""white"" is because they moved where the sun don't shine a long time ago."
Aren’t gingers a greater minority? Why take the role away from a natural ginger? Oh no what have I become
"Dislike the trailer is the right thing, it's not racist"
"Is this when everyone gets sanctimonious, but when it's released no one actually supports it, cause it sure seems like it's getting set up for a doozy."
"There are obviously a lot of racists people who hate this new mermaid because she’s black, but I think that a lot of dislikes comes from people who hate Disney because they know that these race swaps are done not for the sake of real inclusion or diversity, but just to show “ehy look how progressive we are”. It’s also likely just a commercial move, they know that most critics will give a good rating because they’re scared to appear racist even if this live-action remake is gonna be bland as fuck like the other ones."
Why would a creature living under water away from harsh sunlight even develop dark skin
"It’s been said before, but there hasn’t been a single live action Disney remake that has been better than the cartoon counterpart. Why won’t they learn? The Lion King is one of only two films my ADHD son has asked to leave midway through (the other was the recent Fantastic Beasts film which was also dreadful)."
"But also, it’s not really a great trailer. I understand the controversy is about Ariel not being white. But from a trailer perspective it’s sort of mediocre too. People are expecting to see a literally translation from the cartoon and that’s not what this is. I have a feeling when the movie comes out people will love it."
"Regardless of the fictional mermaid's skin color, everyone seems to be ignoring a simple fact:

These live action remakes of Disney films are poorly realized soulless cash grabs that fail to capture the magic of the originals.

Downvote all you want, they were all garbage."
"Disney knew it would get a reaction… it’s a weird moral high ground to take when everyone is like, wait that’s not the little mermaid I remember … then calls anyone who says anything (critics) racist."
"Question, are those trolls in the comment section? They keep saying the part...?"
"The very dim and dingy color grading does no justice to its intent, unless they're going for a **gritty dark reboot** (I know they're not). Even in the linked article, compare the embedded trailer to cast interview clips. It's like they're denying the existence of a full gamut!

It's not just the underwater scenes either, the ones taking place above the waves feel more in place in a bootleg DC offshoot than any Disney property, it feels so dirty and grimy, ew.

For even more relative comparison, watch this side-by-side with other just-announced Disney trailers like https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VayH-CnPh7s and even the Hocus Pocus 2 one has a better dynamic range https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idc0EOmKr30"
I DO NOT ASSOCIATE
At the end where she's sitting on that rock.  It doesn't even look like she's under water.  It looks like a cheap stage play with an average mermaid costume and stage lights to give the effect of water.  At the very least her hair should be flowing like in the Aquaman movie.
"This is all free marketing.

The Huntsman, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin; all these live-action remakes are absolute garbage.  This show will be absolute garbage, too. 

I don't even think any real people care about the race issue.  It's like Disney made a ""controversial"" decision, and then hired an army of PR writers to drum up word of mouth marketing."
I’m mad about her tail looking like a barbie mermaid tail to be honest.
"This will suck for sure, but I worry saying so makes me look racist. 

I want to be clear that this will surely suck in the way that the new Pinocchio sucks. Bad acting, poor script, obvious CGI, just lazy lazy Disney at its worst."
"I hate the little mermaid because its terrible like all live action remakes of cartoons, you hate the little mermaid because you are a racist. We are not the same"
"All from bigoted racists, I’m sure."
she ugly af tho. there are some very very beautiful black women who couldve played the role if disney wanted to represent the ethnicity.
Oh look another waste of money and time live action remake. Goodness can we stop with these? I thought they would have learned their lesson post Mulan Remake backlash with how much it blew up in their face.
"The whole trailer is filmed to prepare the audience for the final revelation that Ariel is black.. ehi world, we run out of ideas for good movies, but look! We're forcing gender and race equality into every new version of our old cartoons"
"I didn't think any of Disney live action remakes were doing well? Set aside people being angry with casting etc why remake these movies to begin with? Originality is certainly a problem with movies being produced today. Seems like more and more we are just cycling through the same movies, making remakes, live action versions."
Shouldn't she be albino? Not much sunlight gets in the sea. It would be cool to have an albino main actress for a change.
"You can think what you want about changing little mermaid from white to black, but to be a grown ass man and get upset about a Disney movie is down right absurd."
I’m thinking about the poor actor who must be in the middle of this. Receiving so much hate for no reason
Fills me with joy how outraged people are…especially the gingers.
I'm a young white male who never watched original cartoon. How can any grown-up person truly care about skin of a fictional character is beyond me.
"She wasn’t cast based on race. They had auditions, she stood out."
I honestly can’t wait to see this movie with the kiddo.
"Least its easy to find the racists.


Honestly  little  mermad will always be wrong until she has big sharp teeth and a fish face"
"Ok after many years of saying white washing was happening in movies and now opposite is happening, ppl grew up and still have the vhs of the original movie.  This isn't some 1940s movie that was overtly racist..yeah a dic appeared in castle..lol.  This is a widely loved movie and to change char is a sin too a whole lot of ppl"
"Great video. And the people saying, “why don’t they just make another black princess?” They did. It’s Ariel. She’s black in this version. 

People telling themselves and the internet they aren’t racist and then arguing against a new film starring a black actress."
Drinking all these delicious tears
Just aggressively ignore all of it.
"Another marketing trick to attract the woke sheep for more viewership. Believe it or not, they're simply using minorities for more $$$. End of story."
"I don’t have high hopes because of the race swapping, I love Halle Bailey’s voice in the trailer and she has a great talent for singing. My problem is that this is another lame, half assed live action remake. Disney has proved to us time and time again that it can’t make a good live action remake because that is impossible. The originals will always have better writing, story, and direction. I’m a bit iffy on Melissa McCarthy as Ursula but Javier Bardem as King Triton I am very excited to see. The only thing I look forward to in this movie is actually the cast itself, it’s gotten a lot of great talent like Bailey and Bardem, along with Daveed Diggs, Jacob Tremblay, and Awkwafina. Will I give this movie a chance, yes. Will I most likely hate it, yes."
"Wow.

This is getting ridiculous."
"Fucking stupid too seeing people rocket STRAIGHT to the racism when like, the actual movie proves why it's bad lmao."
I just really hope this opens the door for Nicolas Cage to play Blade next.
"The only thing that bothers me about this white character becoming a black character is that people would be furious if a black woman was white washed and went from being black to white. Imagine if Jake from state farm was always black and then for some reason they gave some white dude the exact same name. And It reeks of ""black people are so in right now""
They would have never casted an Asian woman or a Hispanic woman 
Or an Indian Woman. Black women with white features are what sells!"
I'd really love to see the alternate reality if they took The Princess and the Frog and cast a white actress as Tiana. Surely everyone here would have the same reactions... right?
Based on what I’m reading you’re either (1) entirely sure the trailers critics are pathetic racists that care too much about a childrens movie or youre (2) entirely sure the people who love this are woketards who are Disney shills
When I found out about this I was like “…..But Moana?????&Tiana&pochantis&the queen of Atlantis??? But to have her play Ariel?! You had to have know this was gonna get spit on”
I mean Disney for sure knew this was going to be the result. I knew this was gonna be the result when I heard about the casting a year or two back.
Waiting for the “white girl” live version remake of Tiana and Princess and the Frog…. Guessing that won’t happen?  Why not?  Artists interpretation.
Idt people hate a black Little Mermaid. People hate the agenda behind it. What agenda? Watch a YouTube video on “Why Marvel Phase 4 is Suck”. Could help.
Now do Princess Jasmine as a white girl.
Why does no one talk about Hispanics/Latinos being ignored for these kind of recasts???
"To be fair, the movie genuinely looks pretty bad and I think people are sick of remakes. But I’ll still give it a watch on Disney+ so I do hope it’s at least decent. I never root for a movie to be bad."
This was the goal of Disney marketing and casting. Most viewed trailer in history. Controversy = traffic.
Go woke go broke?
Because of racism.
"Its weird to me that people on both sidesfeel like they cant associate with a FICTIONAL character unless theyre the same gender and skin color as them. Its fucking weird guys, both the people angry for the change and the ones making cringe reaction videos of her being black. 

And lets be honest its a disney live action, its gonna be dogshit regardless of what color she is lol"
"I think it's because she's not that great of a singer, has really weird wide spaced eyes and the CG sucks."
People need to stop being racist. Grow up please
"What a stupid, meaningless thing to get all whiney and racist about.  People are utter cretins."
The trailer made me literally cry.
"I don't really care about the race or anything, it just seems like a stupid change"
"The REAL casting blunder of this movie is having a 56 year old Ariel. We could have had mermaid zendeya, but instead we’re getting Halle Berry with half-assed cgi that’s supposed to make her younger just have her face look more alien and unnatural than her tail."
Couldn't have picked a more not so good looking actress
"And, racistly, the most altered one as well."
Jesus Christ I preferred it when actors were unnaturally attractive. Whats up goggle eyes over here?
"Ok so here me out.
In the original little mermaid Sebastian did say that its the black fishes sing.
All the others just play music.
Except for that kinky blowfish."
Doesn’t this take place in a setting and time period that is almost defined by colonialism and the ownership of black people?
"The movie is gonna be shit either way, but that's modern day capitalism for you"
"the colors of the ocean are too dark, I had to turn my brightness up to see anything. I hate that about live action remakes, the colors are not as beautiful and vibrant as in the original.

her voice is pretty nice but when she sang ""wish I could be"" I hated that how she did it like  BeeEEEEeeEeeEEEEee and not like ""beeeeeeeeeeee"". I dislike that style of singing.

the tail looks absolutely awful, they should've made a costume like for H2O. would've looked way better than this.

why does she not have red hair ?

and i'm sorry but for my taste her eyes are too far apart."
Race stuff aside it looks pretty bad.
"Two issues I have, first it looks dull as shit. Second this is a shit attempt by an awful company to make themselves look good."
"Why do people care so much about what race a character is. If it doesn't affect the story or the character then who gives a fuck. Ariel could be black, white, Asian, native American, who gives a shit"
"Well, she does look like a genuine fish. I guess it’s too realistic for a romanticized title?"
"I hate how this is so politicized. I just want to hate this movie because these ""live-action"" remakes of classic animated films are little more than market-research-driven ugly computer-animated films with creepy deepfake celebrities superimposed over them.  And in this case the decision to make the whole shebang look so murky is beyond my comprehension.  Why? Because underwater is murky? C'mon!

But no, now I have to say ""oh this is fine"" because to say otherwise puts you in the camp of the actual bigoted monsters. It's like it's the ultimate Disney marketing tactic. Fuck this movie. Fuck the people who are hating this movie for their nasty monster reasons.  Fuck Disney.  And while I'm at it, I might as well go fuck myself."
Stop calling CGI diarrhea films live action.
Is it not a rather big assumption to assume dislikes = automatic racism?
The little mermaid:the return of the EBT card
I'm ready for a live-action remake of Pocahantas. Starring Jennifer Lawrence as Pocahantas.
"I just feel so bad for the actress Halle Berry, such a shitty situation to be in. People need to grow up, it's a movie."
"12 Years a Slave, starring Bryan Cranston as Solomon Northup."
Racism quantified.
"I don’t care about the race swap, but it’s legit unnecessary and will bring tons of trouble. I work at Disney parks and I’m worried about what will happen with the meet and greets. Ariel in the parks is a white red head, as she is in classic movie. Will she now be brown? Will she be both? What if a black family wants to meet brown Ariel but they get the white redhead one? They will be mad as fuck. What if racists run into the brown one? They will be mean as fuck to her. It will be hell. 

If Disney leaves classic Ariel at the parks, people will call out racism. If they make her brown, they will get called out as woke and will provoke hostility from some guests. If they do both? Then problems like I described above will occur every fucking day. 

As I said, I’m indifferent of the movie’s portrayal of Ariel. But you don’t just change the race of an established character without sure chaos ready to take place. Dumb move imo. could’ve hired that actress to be Tiana and would’ve done great."
"It's funny how these complaints are laughable, but whenever a role is recast with a white actor we get lectured on how serious it is? The hypocrisy is tiring."
"Guys, If Brandy can pull off playing Cinderella, Halle Bailey can do it. I think Brandys Cinderella with Whitney Houston is the best one!! Anyway I hate the live action remakes but I’m so excited for this one. The little mermaid was my favorite as a kid and still is, I 100% believe they chose the right woman to play Ariel. 

Not to mention her voice is just.. wow!"
Racially motivated idc
No such thing as bad publicity. Seeing so many trolls hate something just makes others want to see it.
Only thousands?   Kinda sounds like they’re underselling that number.
She looks like the Grindylows from Harry Potter.
A bigot’s thought experiment. Don’t normalize this.
I love seeing Reddit go at each others throats over differing opinions of a kids movie. This is too funny
I wpnder how many went there not to watch the tralier but just to leave a dislike? Close your eyes from 1:00 to 1:17 and you'll completely miss what most of those dislikes were for.
I just don’t understand why the screen cap I keep seeing is such muddy colours
Good. I hope they change it
Why isnt Principe Eric black?
"All press is good press.

It sucks, and I feel for the actress, she doesn't deserve any of this, but the ""controversy"" will increase sales."
"Thousands?

1.3 million is more like it."
You know theres a few people who disliked it because its another tasteless remake of a classic disney film. But none of the others shitty live action remakes got this kind of backlash. You know most of the outrage is from racists who will never watch this movie anyway and are just pissed that a black person is getting the spotlight for once.
"Those haters really love Disney for doing stuff like this. That's how they get all their ad money.

Heck, if it wasn't for these haters, these movies would probably be forgotten in a few months, along with all the other mediocre remakes like Clash of the Titans, Ben Hur, Death Wish, Hellboy, etc."
"Im not a fan of this movie bc I already know what’s going to happen story wise, and because Disney remakes are consistently the worst trash Disney releases. Really was hoping for something original but Disney executives seem to be releaseing the same movie. I’m also terrified to put my opinion out there for fear of being labaeled racist, when Infact my issue with this is strictly story/corporate related."
my only complaint is that the color palette looks super washed out and all the vibrant colors from there original are gone.
"Unrelated somewhat, I rather enjoyed beauty and the beast live action, granted I like Emma Watson as an actress / her playing the role. But I don't think she was good for the singing role."
"I'm having flashbacks to 2016 and everybody who criticized Ghostbusters was called a sexist and a racist, lol. I saw the movie and it's shit."
">...with thousands of dislikes -

More than **Pinnochio, the Dumpster Fire**?"
“With thousands of dislikes” you mean 1.5M.
How can you tell ? They disabled it
Disney fans are the new Rick and Morty fans
Thousands is massive understatement.
"“Thousands”, lol"
thousands = 1.5 million dislikes
Hundred of thousands***
"I havent seen the trailer but I have no problem with her being black, but id take issue if she was the *only* black person in the movie and they keep everyone else white. If you want diversity and inclusiveness then make king trition black or redesign the merfolk to be inspired by a black culture or have the human kingdom be different otherwise you might as well make her white"
Thousands??? It’s at least over a million
But thousands of dislikes is like nothing
"If Sebastian is blue, I’m going to boycott!"
Race drivers are gonna racist.
"Pretty sure Disney knew a live-action remake, or any remake, would suck so they purposefully cast a black actor to get brownie points that way and likely counted on the pushback to garner even more brownie points (haters were never gonna go see it, but the anti-hate folks might). When Disney cuts their own stuff up in order to appease certain countries you know they must have expected this to happen."
"Oh, what a surprise......!"
"Can’t take these folks serious LMAO 

they’re THAT upset over a mermaid.

Oh well. They better not fuck up Under The Sea"
I don’t know why anybody gives a shit.
"i'm only now realizing there a lot of dedicated racists in EVERY fanbase in every pop culture thing. even the gay fantasy book reading loving tolkien nerds recently whining about the house of dragon stuff.  to the people whining about buzz lightyear the movie being ""woke"". i imagine the people having a issue with the little mermaid being black are the kind that buy season passes to disneyworld. I swear if a future harry potter movie casted a black guy for a white character in the books we would hear the same thing and jk rowling would rightfully tell the people whining to kindly fuck off"
"I think Disney is behind a lot of this outrage marketing because it is free and apparently very easy to fish people in on arguing over it. 

I’m sure there are people who are actually upset about her skin color but there is so much coordination to Disney’s releases I also wouldn’t be surprised if they had a fleet of bots stoking the fire."
"You dislike it because of racism.

I dislike it because it's another soulless unnecessary Hollywood nostalgia remake.

We are not the same."
Nice! Fuck them all!
Gee I wonder why
Still has red hair - works for me. Still never watch it unless it’s with my granddaughters.
Obviously this is racist and ignorant as fuck but at the end of the day it’s just straight up total immaturity.
"They announced the casting choice (what feels like) years ago. Same reaction. Disney is hungry for the demographics. 

I’m like 90% sure that one of the characters is going to be Hispanic. Like, fucking imagine if Sebastian speaks Spanish.

Feel free to down vote, but the anger about this Ariel is not only racism."
"These racist idiots fail to realize something.... 

Ariel is a fictional character. She can be white, black, brown, orange, purple, pink, polka dot, and/or zebra striped. It's not based off a real person. 

""Not staying true to the original"" is horseshit. If they did a live action Pinky & The Brain, would they be pissed off that Brain wasn't short, fat, and had jowls the likes of Orson Welles?"
"Racists absolutely melting down, what's new"
Sorry.  What race are mermaids supposed to be then?  We should have fact checked that first?
Hooray for racism
Yeah Im sure live-action The Little Mermaid is the most anticipated thing Disney has done in the last decade. Im sure those views are all legitimate.
"Why the fuck is this random blog platforming self-described ""theocratic fascist"" Matt Walsh?"
"You can say all you want about it not being about skin color, but if Bruce Wayne or Clark Kent went black, it would be the same exact shit all over again."
What if she comes across a sunken slavery ship? That would be so dope! “ I want to see where my ancestors live… before they were killed by people who hate meeeeee!”
So much hate for the live Aladdin remake but when it came out we had to admit Wil Smith did it right.
"I must preface this with an acknowledgment to Holly’s acting ability — she’s great at what she does — but she is not the right pick for the role. It just doesn’t make sense from a logistics standpoint to have dark skinned mermaids. Sunlight isn’t able to affect sea life in the same way it affects land creatures since water refracts, thus deluding the UV rays. This is why sea life was the first to evolve as it wasn’t exposed to radiation prior to the forming of the ozone layer. 

They could just as easily create a new story based on the same fairytale without it being a copy/paste of their original version of the movie but with more diversity. They made multiple version of Cinderella without having the exact same setup."
Lol let the bigots squirm
"Americans be appropriating other culture's stuff again, Fucking American culture Imperialism."
"Yea you’ve got all the people who have an issue with her being black and the fact that the trailer just didn’t look good, looks like another lack luster remake"
How is it possible to be so mad at a trailer that reveals almost absolutely nothing.
How’s about the fact that Disney needs to come up with NEW material.  Are they going to do EVERY one of the classic cartoons as live action?!!  Come on…. They are even remaking the Haunted Mansion movie…. WHY?!?
I think they only keep making white people into black characters just so they can squeeze some money into their pockets thinking there pushing some agenda
"Is this really a race thing, or are people just finally fed up of crappy live action remakes?"
"I wonder how it's going to handle Ursula, Sebastian, Flounder, and Scuttle. 

Also the whole ""Kiss the Girl"" sequence. A bunch of CGI animals singing will either be weirdly funny or horrifying."
"Instead of taking a very old story and changing it, why not just make a brand new story??? 

Like it seems so simple for both ends of the argument. 

Plus. I want new movies. Very baised there. 

We gotta stop “remaking” everything and have a few new ideas lol"
They're not talking about you. They're talking about fictional characters. FIC-TION-AL CHAR-AC-TERS! Am I getting through to you at all?
"Imagine bring mad at Disney for not sticking to the source material, and having the chief complaint be *skin color*."
I just can't get over that a bunch of people are mad that a made up half fish lady is a different skin color. If they focused that energy on anything important we'd be further advanced as a society
Can anyone prove Disney isn't just manufacturing outrage to curb the success of an oversaturated market of remakes? How many of those dislikes and negative comments are just bots?
"Whatever. I'm so beyond sick of reading ""controversy"" about movies like this. Haters are always going to make a huge deal about the race swap thing. Meanwhile, fans are always going to lose their minds over every single callback and reference to the original film. In the end, it's just a derivative remake that no one will remember in five years. Let Disney keep pumping them out if they want to, and let the audience keep paying to see them if they are so inclined, but please for the love of God, can we all just agree to stop pretending to be outraged about multi-million dollar Hollywood movies?"
I actually like all these live action Disney films.  Just watched Pinocchio and thought it was pretty good.
Imagine if she was picked because of her talent?!?
Announcing live action princess and the frog starring Billie Eilish
"All goes according to plan… Talk about it bad, good, whatever, keep talking about it"
"I mean I wasn't going to see it, regardless."
I never understood why disliking things is necessary if it’s not actively harmful. Most things in the world are not going to be made for you. Why give those things the energy of negativity? Why seek things out specifically to dislike? I don’t get it. In my life I’ve probably “disliked” maybe 10 YouTube videos total
The racists have really gone wild with review bombs lately.
I’m still waiting for the passion of the Christ reboot with a black Jesus. The collective imploding of the Bible Belt would be superb
"Are people honestly upset that a mermaid, which aren’t real!!, is being played by an African American?! Mermaids aren’t real!!!! If that’s the case, can we all be upset that Avatar is played by white folks and not real blue people!!!!"
"Racist twits. There’s simply no justification to dislike this movie yet.  It may suck in its own right, but as it stands right now only racism."
"I have hated the term ""ginger"" since it started a few years ago. My daughter is a redhead, as is my ex-wife. My daughter is all about hello kitty and Bluey right now, she won't care about little mermaid until she has a unicorn horn and magical powers. It's who she is, it's what she likes. To see other little girls scream ""mommy she's brown like me!"" at the little mermaid, my dad heart just melts. All kids deserve heros, parents just need to get out of the way sometimes."
"Didn't watch the trailer. Not interested. Couldn't care less.

But I still just went on YT just to Like it.

""I'm doing my part!"""
And so it begins
"People are upset that a *mermaid* is a different color than in the original? A fucking mermaid.

I can’t even man"
"It’s make believe, not a documentary or biography…and it’s about mermaids. God damn mermaids who last I checked weren’t real either. So for all I care or anyone else we could make them have blue skin w a thick Boston accent. Point being, if they cast a POC and that upsets you, man you’ve got far more important things to be pissed about. Like real life problems not make believe problems."
"1.6 mil dislikes out of how many views??? 

Perspective, people."
"I was immediately outraged when I read the first sentence. I don't care about Disney making live action versions of thier animated classics, or if they change the color of thier skin.

I'm dyslexic, it thought they said Halle Berry.

The Little Mermaid is a princess, Halle Berry is a Queen!"
" I’ve been arguing with idiots all day about this. Some people have no idea what it feels like to have a lack of representation in entertainment. Literally no idea, why would she get the part JUST because she’s black? That shit is insulting and racist."
White people are ridiculous
Because she’s black. So sad.
I'm sure this about ethics in video game journalism or something equally valid.
I have hopes for the movie but the trailer was lame. TBH I only really care about Ursula; Melissa McCarthy better be amazing because I’ll never forgive her if she isn’t.
I'm surprised that they made a movie not tailored towards the Chinese market
"What…. racist cretins in the world!? Shocked, I tell ya’, shocked."
Its because when they click a dislike button they know they won't get doxed for their racism like if they openly spoke out about it. I'm pretty sure that the opposition to this more or less has racist motivations.
Oooh the dislike button is back?? Thank fuck. Nothing like sitting through a 10 minute intro to some shit tutorial that doesn't even work because you can't see the dislikes
"I’m all for having someone not already hugely famous as the main character. 

So tired of every movie needing huge actors to either play or voice the characters. 
There once was a time when animated movies didn’t have to push the famous actors that voice them all over the marketing. It takes away from the movie."
"I don't think raceswapping white characters for sake of diversity has helped reduce racism but has led to dividing people. **Many** movies and stories with white characters are being race swapped from white to black, meanwhile when a movie or story that is based on black culture there is little to no changes to ethnicity of the black characters to diversify the story/movie. You can say ""this is just a children movie"", and you're right, but it's happening almost everywhere. And it's not just limited to race swapping, there is also gender swapping, changing of characters persona, dialogues, plots and more.

Can't say I mind this trailer though, the actor looks and sounds nice, but it's really uncomfortable to see people call others racists so easily while ignoring the many things happening in popular culture that makes people angry."
"I don’t mind who’s playing Ariel, but can we please stop using these muted, drab and dull color palettes for all these live action Disney movies?"
Pandering sales.  I wasn’t a fan of Ghost in a Shell with Scarlett Johansson.  But love the anime… Race is getting out of hand.  A story is a story though.
Shit I’m more pissed with crap CGI! I could draw better tail than that crap.  Unreal
Eric's about to get himself some live action Caspian caviar
I honestly don’t know why people are complaining her voice is so perfect for this.
Breaking news: racism is still a thing
I’m more upset about that unnecessary vocal run she added to a perfect song
"Personally I like when shows / films stick to the source material, as in, the people LOOK like they are from that thing I love to watch... if wanting that makes me racist then, weird take, but okay.

The actress in this looks nothing like the source material.

They got live action Aladdin right. Will Smith was a weird choice but whatever. 

At the end of the day these movies are bad regardless...

So go ahead Disney, waste your money on whatever you want."
Isn’t Disney the same people that remove black people from Chinese posters to please them? And you guys are gonna run and support this money grab? I don’t get it
"B... b... But...

YouTube removed the dislike. Impossible! /s"
I think Disney is being super progressive by hiring an actual fish to play Ariel
"Same would happen if someone replaced Black Panther with a white dude. There’re plenty of white dudes in SA, but it would just be dumb af."
"If I was casting Little Mermaid, I would have picked either a White girl or an Asian girl, but they are obviously going for a certain demographic with this play and it's probably part of a broader advertising strategy. Between black panther, princess and the frog and the new little mermaid, they are building up a nice little portfolio."
Racists didn’t like this.
Fuck those 1.5 million racist assholes
"Race/gender swapping is so unauthentic and just plain lazy. And let's be honest, it's Disney here that we are talking about so it's not like they are being altruistic. 

Only race swapped I've ever liked was Nick Fury. They wanted to update him in the Spiderman comics and they modeled him after a much more badass Samuel L. Jackson. This wasn't just a race swap though, as it was also a character upgrade and was popular enough among fans that they cast him to play that role in the movies."
I love Rings of Power and am a true Tolkien fan. An enormous amount of reviews are bro brothers who really aren’t fans just ripping the show because Elon musk tweeted he didn’t like it. The toxic male crap happening all over the place is disgusting. It’s gotten to the point that I don’t pay attention to the reviews or read a few and once they start spewing “woke” or “diverse” stuff I tune them out. They are bullies like their overlords. Streaming services should go back to Nielsen ratings or most watched ratings. I’m glad Netflix got rid of it.
It wasn’t necessary at all to change this.  I’d say that they even damaged a positive role model for young red heads who often are picked on as well.  They should just make new movies with new characters who are black.  Or heaven forbid they actually make some more black fairy tales.  Almost none of the ones I was read growing up have even 2nd tier movies.
The discourse around this this week worldwide has been insane and exhausting. Braindead takes in all languages across all countries
They really made the little mermaid black?  I thought it was a joke hahaha
"Y’all acting like it’s a crime to not like the constant race swapping, Having to preface all this shit with disclaimers and all, can’t have rational discourse on here.  On the other hand as well, white guys been playing Persians, Egyptians and everything in between for ages, where was the massive outrage then. But two wrongs don’t make a right is my motto. All this race swapping is unnecessary and reeks and pandering."
"Currently at [576k up, 1.6m down](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-wPm99PF9U)."
"Please make this actually a good live-action remake. Just nail it, just to push the nail in. Go all out with this film."
Im just gonna leave this hear so when its locked i  can comment
"I don’t understand tho. Why do they make stories of white established character instead of just using an ip they already have like princess and the frog and promote there movie to black audiences like that? White people will have just as much of a problem with race swapping a character just as much as Asian/Japanese people had a problem with Scarlet Johansson playing as a Japanese character in ghost in the shell. 

And y’all redditors out here thanking Disney for diversity and inclusion let’s not forget how they receive a lot of money for working with the CCP and shot “Mulan” (live action version)in the same province where xinjiang Muslims are being tortured.

These guys aren’t inclusive at all, they are just pandering lol"
"I’m upset now!!! This complete bs. Why isn’t the original little mermaid blue!!!! That’s discrimination against Mermaid’s!! They are blue with dark hair!! Why did they make her pale with red hair?! Unreal.

That sounds as dumb as the racist who are hating on the live action. Weirdo’s"
I can't believe they didn't cast an actual mermaid
RUNNNNNN!!! She’s black and that’s somehow fundamental to my comprehension/reception of the story. Fuck me racists are beyond stupid

Sad to see, personally I loved the trailer, to me she has red hair, that's her signature feature in the Disney version, and that girls voice is so enchanting, she's going to kill it."
"Oh come on, the film didn't look THAT bad. Sure the animation isn't top notch and it's another unnecessary reboot. But, I'm still going to see it cause I enjoy watching new films. I even watch poorly reviewed movies like Pinocchio and Light-year (I saw both opening day) cause I want to form my own opinion, not have it decided for me by other people.

I'm looking forward to the music. I love musicals especially in the theater with the surround sound. I suspect the soundtrack is going to be the best part of this movie."
"Wtf is this? Srsly? Over the little mermaid, guys?"
Maybe it’s just the part I watched but I hate it when people over sing things.
They should have also cast Marjorie Taylor Greene as Ursula. It would have been perfect!
I thought the dislike button was disabled?
Cause no one wants to watch that crap lol.
"What bothers me the most is that at the end when she's singing looking up at the surface, she's *clearly* not underwater. Like they didn't even try to make it look like she was.

If it's going to be like that in the whole of the released film, I feel like the whole movie will feel ""off"" to a major degree.

I kinda suspect this will flop at the box office, and get panned as the worst of the Disney live action films."
America is beyond racist and white supremacist settler colonial state
It’s amazing how fandom makes racism okay.
"Anyone who is upset about her race isn't thinking about the bigger picture...I had no idea who this actress was, but I looked her up, and you have to admit she kind of looks like a fish.

https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Halle-Bailey-16x9-1.jpg"
I'm willing to bet less people care about what shade of human a fictional character is and more pissed about constant unoriginality.
A bunch of grown ass adults really throwing a fucking fit over nothing. Bunch of damn clowns.
"Honestly didn’t notice the skin colour, I was too focused on how far apart her eyes are. She looks more normal in other photos (I googled) must be a particularly bad angle."
"At this point they are cynically using actors of colour to shield them from any legitimate forms of criticism.

Like why they even needed a live action version of this movie."
Anyone who even thinks anything about any of this is worth talking about in any way is a complete and utter waste of human life. It's a thing that people made. Your opinion is as meaningless as your pathetic fucking life.
2 million dislikes. Get it right.
"Just waiting for Disney to withdraw the animated movie into the vault for a couple years (removing from Disney+ too).

In fact, they should have done that already, then announced they would be releasing on Disney+ 1 month after the new movie."
"Fool me once.

Fool me… what is this 8 times now?"
"Well what did you expect? People loved their little mermaid, why fuck with it?"
"I just watched the YT trailer.... wtf are the comments.

I love this part.. 
that part.. 
I absolutely like the... 
best scene was... 
my favorite is...

lmao what am I missing?"
Thousands? I heard hundreds of thousands at least...
Disney is great at making new princesses I’m not sure why they felt the need to race swap. Just come up with some original content.
I don't know if it was a wig or something like that but her hair just doesn't look good. It should be way more vibrant! This is a movie about mermaids make her hair scarlet not orange.
"Encanto, into the spider verse, moana, Raya, turning red... universally loved.. but no its racists .. maybe people would like to see original stories (with any color person) than rehashing movies that were already pretty damn perfect."
Thousands?  It's up to 1.7 million.
How do they know? I thought Youtube removed that xD
The most annoying thing about the trailer is all the “the part where Ariel says…” comments
"I thought the trailer looked great. What a lovely girl, and such an amazing/beautiful voice!"
"Honestly I think this outrage could be deliberate. If this never happened a lot of people would probably never have heard of it or thought about it, a lot of the people who are getting super mad about it probably wouldn't have seen it in the first place but now the movie is a lot more talked about"
"Mermaids are mythical creatures but it bothers me that live action ones don't have gills. She's singing ""underwater"" and should still be letting out air bubbles at regular intervals from at least her mouth even if they don't give her gills. 

Disney has done live action mermaids in pirates of the Caribbean on stranger tides and they looked fantastic and realistic. This looks way to fake."
"It’s millions of dislikes, not thousands."
"Is there any proof this is linked to her skin color ? The youtube comments seem to be memeing something entirely unrelated, although I'm not sure what"
All that just for having a black protagonist huh. Telling.
A really popular rocket league former pro and his gf were streaming and talking about how they didn’t like her being black. And the reasoning was because black people “can’t” have red hair. Guess they overlooked the fact that she is a fish lol
Millions of dislikes
It's neither making history nor their most viewed trailer
It has over 1.5 million dislikes lol
"2 things.

1. Why on earth are they making a live action of this? Leave it as is.
2. People really do care about race it seems regardless of what they spout."
I wonder what kind of metaphor they’re going for.
"Don't care who plays Ariel, but make the ocean look more vibrant at least. Lighting's terrible."
People are such haters.
I'm hoping they didn't spend much on marketing because this movie is getting more publicity than you could possibly buy...or maybe that was their goal all along?
I want a live action Shrek next.
A million dislikes*
I wonder what percentage of those votes are from viewers under 18
lmao every negative comment on the video is being deleted
Can the live action ones please be villain origin stories from now on? like Cruella and Maleficent??? Pretty please!?
"You just have to think of them as different movies. I liked the new Pinocchio although it’s not the same. Some parts were even better than the original from the 40s. Remember these are kids movies that introduce life lessons with musicals and shit lol.
It’s not like they changed Italian Pinocchio to a Asian Bamboocchio. Or Snow White to Coal Black and the 7 little people. The blue fairy in the new Pinocchio is much better and more memorable than the original too"
The trailer does not make me want to watch it. Big fail disney.
Personally I don’t like any of the remakes in the live action - Disney steals from itself steals from others basically plagiarizes itself at every turn just to make another buck can’t do anything original they can kiss my ass and fuck off do something new and different. I figure eventually Pixar will be remaking the live action to Pixar remakes.
I wonder if this movie will be supported?
"I'm not even too PC but it looks fine. 
I maybe wouldn't like different complexion for historical figures. Even Jake Gylelenhuleugh for Persian Prince was a weird choice.

But the Ariel girl looks pretty and naive like I expect to be and it's fine."
"Reminds me of Wizard of Oz and when they did ""The Wiz"""
I dislike it too. The story is about a woman who is able to get the man of her dreams ONLY when she changes herself and is forced to shut the fuck up.
what about a million dislikes?
Why does Disney even keep making these remakes? They’re all horrible. Just got done watching the live action Pinocchio and I’m beyond disappointed. Just like I was with Aladdin and the Lion King.  Not sure how Chloe’s acting is but I am in love with her voice so I’ll watch it. Hopefully it’s executed decently. My expectations aren’t high to begin with.
I’m upset they changed the song lyrics in this trailer. Isn’t she singing to Eric?
"Honestly, the majority of live action Disney remakes are boring as hell (Beauty and the beast is the worst)...  I'm having high hopes for this one.  Actually, I'd like them to keep more to the book where the ending isn't the happy one we had in the animation."
"Love it!  People need to realize mermaids  🧜‍♂️ aren't real!  It's like Santa Claus, he can be whatever color a person wants."
"So many racist people in the world. Complaining about the skin color of a mermaid, cool. Most won't even watch the movie, they just like being angry at pointless things."
"Oh wow, racists being racist. What a news!"
Tell me these are the same people that years ago.. loved Hamilton…
"These movies could make $0 and get zero views and they would achieve their aim: extend the copyright on the originals for another 50 years.

Even Disney doesn’t care what colour the characters are. Putting a black girl in a old role balances the race stats allowing you to put a white girl in the next blockbuster.

None of these remakes matter."
I really couldn't care less what her skin color is if she does the character justice  my only problem is that switch the situation a black character cast by a white actress people would be flipping their shit
"It’s hilarious that it’s always the gingers and redheads, should ask the leprechauns if they are offended and if not, we can move on."
"Idk man. If I was sailing the high seas and I happened upon a mermaid, her being black would not be a the top of my “I can’t believe this” list. It’d probably be the gills. Or the huge fish tail."
"If you're a grown man who's irrationally angry about a Disney princess in a movie for 8 year old girls not being race accurate to mermaid lore, you should be forced to wear a badge  so the rest of us can identify you on sight and avoid you. It would probably help them too, because when they start to act like a fucking moron in public, we can see the badge and understand that they're just too dimwitted to know any better."
Thanks dArK bRaNdOn
And millions of LIKES
The very fact it makes this many sad people this angry means it’s really necessary.
"Disney: Millions of young black woman available.

Disney: choose 56 years old actor to play young mermaid"
Not seen it - what was the common reason for the dislike?
"White dislikes, and who cares? Whine on!"
If people dislike because the actress is black then they are not being logical. The question for me is whether the actress was chosen on merit and suitability or because of her colour.
"The people who shout ""snowflake"" often certainly do seem to be very, snowflakey themselves.  Over a mythical fictional children’s character, screaming ""But people of that time there were white, it’s not realistic!"" While having zero issue with mermaids and talking crustaceans."
*millions of dislikes
Part of your world was animated with a sense of wonder and curiosity. Not too make it look like Ariel is running away from a deadbeat household.
Because everyone knows that mermaids are white... 🙄
The Ghostbusters remake with all women was downvoted because it was terrible
And that’s exactly what they were aiming for with the casting
How about stopping with these remakes and just make new IP? So boring seeing all the live versions that are mostly worse off than the cartoon. Feels like they are just doing this to keep the copy right.
Stay mad
"It just looks super dark, which makes sense cause there isn’t a lot of light unda da sea but I want to be able to see"
"I’ve never seen anyone more perfect for a role than Halle Bailey, she already looks like a mermaid 🧜‍♀️ (hey apple, fix your emojis, mermaids are half human, so it follows that they must come in all shapes, sizes and ethnicities)

It reminds me of when there were an audition at the Swedish tv for [Pippi Longstocking](https://youtu.be/FaWN4BRSX0o) a little girl at the audition told her mother “look! There’s the real Pippi!” The girl she was referring to got the part."
Thousands? Try 1.7 million (according to bring back youtube dislikes chrome addon)
"Imagine with all the shit going on in our country, and the rest of the world, people who work 40-50 hours a week still finding the time and energy to somehow be offended/outraged by black mermaids, elves, dwarves, and hobbits. I can't believe how dumb and shitty half the people in this Country are."
"She’s black because oscars announced only movies with “lead roles to minority’s “  will qualify for awards. 

That’s why you’ve seen all movies start to Lean this way"
"The only thing that infuriated me was her riffing all over the place on the vocals. The songs are classics, leave them be, this isn't American Idol."
"Look, I’m all for keeping established lore consistent (fuck you, rings of power).  But Ariel is a fucking mermaid, not a human.  Who gives a shit what color her skin is?"
“How dare you make a fictional character black!!!” -incels
"They chose her because she was the best out of everyone that auditioned. They’ve spoken about this already.

I can’t imagine caring about the skin colour of a fucking mermaid. I have a mortgage to pay"
Fuck the haters.
Yo fuck this article and fuck this website
The keep using the worst picture of all time for these posts about it to
Another bunch of tired 'critics' claiming people hate the trailer because Ariel is black and therefore all critique is just racism and can be dismissed without thought.
I didn’t even know this was a thing before seeing this post right now.
"I’m honestly just watching for Halle’s voice and because I love mermaids. 

On the flip side, while other people are complaining about some races not getting roles… I probably have to wait 80 years until there’s another Native/indigenous Disney movie that’s not Pocahontas or brother bear🖕"
Who cares what others think. There are thousands of little girls that are ecstatic that Ariel is black...it's strategic. They need more fans of color to replace those chased away by DeSantis and company.
Disney is **lovin'** the free publicity all the the racists are generating.
"I just wish someone, somewhere, could manage to create a new original IP."
"oh God,

it's a fucking mermaid is it really that deep"
where do you see the current number of dislikes?
"I dont care about her being black at all, I am just tired of Disney. Their shit sucks now."
"So it got like 1.5 million dislikes because or how the mermaid looked?  I agree, they should have never changed the character design of mermaids.  #bringbackmanatees"
"*Mickey sits in a dark room somewhere*

“All according to plan.”"
"I know It's a live action, but making the atmosphere hyper realistic (dark below the sea) is so stupid, I get sea horror movie vibes from it."
that many dislikes is the greatest indicator of success.
"The only criticisms I had were I'm not keen on the warbling, and also I'm just done with teaser trailers lol

I swear teaser trailers used to have more footage than they do these days, this was pretty much one scene."
"To be fair, Disney hasn't made a good live action remake yet.

The only time I've given a shit about the skin color of a character is Roland Deschain from The Dark Tower.  An integral element to the entire story is the racial tension, dynamic, and acceptance between him (white) and another character (black).  There's nothing wrong with Idris Elba, he just shouldn't have been cast as Roland.

Otherwise, this is just screeching from racists."
"We need more, good, original content. Stop rinsing old stuff for clicks."
"Man, do.not tempt the bear, the animal.is wounded and has nukes."
No such thing as bad publicity
"There are racists on YouTube? Oh no! 
/s"
"When they announced the cast my only question was can she sing and act?  (All sources point to yes) Because Emma Watson is a talented actress, looked the part as Belle, but is not a singer. I don’t think I’ll see this one in theaters.  Why pay to see a movie I watched over and over again in VHS as a kid?  But I’ll watch it on Disney +."
"The funny part is it's definitely NOT the kids giving dislikes. Like grow tf people, you aren't the target audience"
Lmfaoooooooooooooooo
"Must say I have not really liked ANY of the live action remakes they’ve made. 

I don’t really see the point and they usually don’t add anything useful to the IP. 

BUT if people are hating on it for having a “dark” Ariel then these racists can you f@&k themselves for all I care. There is no place for discrimination in this world."
My favorite part is according to the US census the white population is steadily declining & globally the trend continues.
My wife is unhappy with Melissa McCarthy being cast for Ursula. She's not a huge fan of the actresses brand of comedy and it makes her concerned for the film in general.
Now how many dislikes are because this is a cheap cash grab and how many are because of racists?
"How boring. People and their petty little fears, the story has been done."
It's a fish with a human head. People need to calm down.
"Honestly i don't care about her race, i just hate live action reboots"
I thought once they found Walt’s directive in his old desk to not remake any of the original films they weren’t going to do any more live action films. Oh well.
"How would people feel if they just made two movies? One with a white Ariel and another with a black Ariel? Would that be a fair compromise? The black Ariel version is just 33 years late, but it comes with all the latest tech."
"Thousands is an understatement. 
It's 1.5 million"
Nobody was surprised
"If the ""Twitter community"" is represented by Matt Walsh we better start building a lot of very tall bridges."
I mean I don't care about the race change (although it's weird how it's always gingers) but all these remakes have sucked something fierce.
If that don’t tell you racism is alive and well then I don’t know what does.
The Bob Chapek era should be interesting
there is a google extension that shows them. 1.5 million dislikes
"You know, as a white guy, I wasn't too happy with this character alteration. When I later watched the footage of those kids' reactions to the trailer, I realized it wasn't for me, so I instantly shut up and moved on."
This is why Youtube removed dislikes
So there is really that much of racists. Oh the world...it's depressing to think a lot of people are actually like that.
"I'm on Youtube right now and yeah, you can see likes but not dislikes."
Yeah the *just stop testing and the results will improve* thinking doesn’t work like they think it does.
Why would you want that? Why is everything not allowed to be the opposite of a good thing. All this positive vibe cr*p is forced n fake making us as depressed and have therapists now!
Only for Presidents
Thats like the dirtiest move ever in a so-called 'free-country'. Absolutely scandalous and the people cant do shit about it. 'Free' has always been an illusion.
I wish her hair was much more colorful! I'm hoping they don't omit Sebastian's singing and turn it into a poor man's Mulan.
"If you have an android you can get Youtube Vanced, its basically free premium and has other features like showing dislikes."
It's also highly inaccurate.
"Or the crap they pulled with the Lion King and be prepared. 

It was suppose to be so epic. Instead it lasted like 40 seconds and had nothing that made that song iconic. 

It was as if Disney just needed a movie to renew the trademarks."
It’s Melissa McCarthy.
"Seeing as how Ursula's character design was heavily inspired by the drag queen Divine, I want to see her played by a dude or trans person. Latrice Royale or Eureka O'Hara would tear that shit up. What's the matter Disney, too *woke* for you?"
I think Lizzo would make a good Ursula
........Jafar doesn't have a song in the first Aladdin
Can Melissa Mccarthy even sing?
"Honestly if I was interested in this movie, I'd much rather they didn't reuse songs that we'd heard in the previous versions.  

I'd say adapt it and remake it, we don't need a remaster of the exactly same script.  

Basically please don't do Lion King again"
"They took out when genie turns into a kid during the parade and says ""100 bad guys with swords!"" In Aladin too."
"Or Scar’s. “Be Prepared” got butchered, it’s such a banger."
"I need to know they do Eric right.

My man got all his men to safety, then went *back* onto a burning sinking ship to save his dog.

He could have easily escaped to safety, but no - he went back for his dog."
"My point of contention is mainly based in these constant reboots where they simply drop in a minority or female and then wait for the praise. If you want a strong minority lead, why not create a new character for them? Currently it's like watching a new Spawn, or Blade, with a white lead."
"I didn't like that trailer either and it's not the actresses' skin-color.

1. It shows nothing to indicate it has something new or cool or better to make it worth watching over the old one.
2. The song sounds worse to me then the original rendition of the song. Maybe it's not the actress and a director choice/direction, but either way, downgrade.
3. The cgi they did on her hair floating in the water is really bad. It's not that her hair is in long dreadlocks, it's that parts of the dreadlocks looked smudged/blurry. Like someone was in photoshop and smeared them. It's very weird and dosen't look real to me at all. And the smudges sometimes cross over her dreadlocks too?? I don't know if they are trying to add like badly drawn loose straight hair mixed in with her dreads but if so it looks stupid/fake and dosen't make sense?

And this is the trailer. If they can't pick something to show their movie is worth watching, find a single song that is either new or sounds at least as good as the original version, or manage to make the main character's CGI look believable . . . that bodes badly for overall quality.

Based off this trailer I'm hesitant to go see this film, it looks sucky. And for reference I'm the target audience. Not only did I watch the original when I was a little girl, I have a mixed race six year old with super curly hair and their Ariel's skintone.  I really want good kids Disney movies in theatres to take her to now that COVID is over (enough?) and she's old enough to sit still and quiet the whole time. But I'm defiantly not going until I see reviews that don't say this film is another trash-sandwich where they remake a classic Disney cartoon ""live action"" with worse musical numbers.

Edit: I love Emma Watson but I did not go see the new version of Beauty and the Beast and from the clips and songs I saw on youtube I feel very good about that decision."
Melissa Mccarthy as Ursula is the greatest casting since Patrick Stewart's Charles Xavier. Won't even need make up or cgi. Can't wait to see her rammed through the chest with a ship.
Wendi McLendon-Covey from The Goldbergs would be a phenomenal Ursula
The very people who complain about “appropriation” and demand that minority characters be portrayed by minority actors will then turn around and mock and deride any white person who tries to apply their own logic in the reverse.
"She is a Mermaid FFS. Do they even have races?

Was the Wil Smith genie horrible too? Cause it was Robin Williams in the cartoon? Or is that OK because they are both blue?

So much fucking horseshit I can't even begin....."
"The Wikipedia says she'll be played by Melissa McCarthy.

Jafar had a song?"
"Jafar only sings one song right? ""Goodbye ex-prince Ali""?"
Melissa McCarthy
Melissa McCarthy so have fun listening to that.
Melissa McCarthy is in the cast so I feel like its going to be her.
"Melissa mcarthy is Ursula.  

As someone else mentioned... it will be crazy when the end has a giant 30 story tall ursula screaming aaaaahhhhh at ariel."
Mellissa McCarthy will be interesting
"I only care because it's lazy of disney to churn out an already made movie and add a black actress and claim diversity

It's shameful because disney only cares about people thinking they care about any sort of diversity"
Oh you’re going to be *sooooooo* happy when you hear that it’s fucking Melissa McCarthy playing Ursula
I liked queen latifah in that anniversary live performance
Megan Thee Stallion as Ursula?
Jafar had a song?
Ursula needs to be a drag queen
Ok you’re the second person who’s said something like in reference to the live action. I honestly haven’t watched anything since beauty and the beast. Are they seriously just omitting songs?? The soundtrack is the best part!! You leave the theater and then relive the movie through the amazing soundtrack
And Scars
"She might not have the size to do Ursula, but the personality I’d crave to see is Jenifer Lewis. There is a sass, a gravitas, an energy that she would own that role!"
"It's Melissa McCarthy

They will save money on make up"
Ursula's now skinny and really wants to help Ariel
I seriously can’t fathom them removing the (arguably) best part and song from the movie.
"Seeing who is playing ursula, im scared"
Is Melissa McCarthy known to sing?
Melissa Mcarthy… don’t get too excited
They had Jafar Binks sing a song? Now I hat the prequels even more. I must have blacked that out.
Live action Ursula is being performed by Melissa McCarthy.
I wanted Ursula to be played by a drag queen so hard… that would have been an actual bold move.
Did some research and found that Melissa McCarthy is going to be playing Ursula.
Oh babey I’m gonna tell you right now Ursula is probably gonna be one of the worst parts of the movie. Extremely unfortunate (souls).
"Scar was cast aside too. Some of the best songs belong to Villians, and they keep cutting them."
Can Melissa McCarthy sing?
Lizzo for Ursula
If only Divine were still kicking
"Potential racism aside that may sway some opinions, if you grow up with a character looking how they do, when it comes to the live action film remake perhaps a lot of people expect that character to look like the character they they know from the cartoon film. Difficult to cast mermaids i know , they are out there tho... somewhere."
America has an abundance of morbidly obese ladies past their prime. Ursula would have been easy to find.
All I cared about was that Ariel's voice was pretty. Which it is. But it's nice to see little girls' astonishment at a princess that looks like them. All those videos made me cry.
Omg… this whole time I thought it was Halle Berry too.
This! Where is the singing Sebastian?
"Yup, I remember when Mulan came out, me and all my friends (all Asian) had a watch party on D+. That shit was straight trash.

Most movie studios, Especially Disney, couldn't care less about diversity and making the world more inclusive. They just care about selling movie tickets. They know that race-swapping their most popular characters is a trend right now and it makes a ton of news. They literally get the same, if not more, media coverage if they race swap or change the sexuality of one of their characters than spending an extra couple million on marketing."
FR. They hate little mermaid because she ain’t white. I hate little mermaid because it will be just another low effort cash grab reboot that lacks the creative passion and charm of the original. We are not the same.
"Its not a ""race swap"". Ariel live action was never white, so they never changed her skin color."
Live action… which is also funny because 90% of the shit in that trailer was never light traveling through a lens and was rendered at some slave labor effects company.
"Yeah with how the other live action remake films have been, they could have found a real mermaid for the role, and I still wouldn’t bother seeing it"
"Say what you will, but the live-action Cinderella was great.  Not as good as the original animated film, but still great in its own right."
"Lin-Manuel Miranda of Hamilton fame is on the film, and this actress can actually sing, so I am more hopeful."
We enjoyed Malificent and the live action Beauty and the Beast. BatB I felt fixed issues with their relationship and made it less Stockholm syndrome.
The new songs might be good. Lin Manuel Miranda will be working on them.
">  low effort live action remake for Disney that will 100% be a lesser version of the original.

I don't disagree that it won't be as impactful as the original.

However, this movie has still taken hundreds (thousands?) of professionals years to make. Script, scoring, storyboarding, acting, editing, etc. Sure, they didn't make the script and score from scratch, but they still had to do tons of work on it.

To call it low-effort is a pretty big slap in the face to all the people who have worked on it. The *initial idea* may have been low-effort, a couple people just saying ""Hey, wanna do The Little Mermaid again? Yeah? Cool!"" but not from then on."
">I don't care much about the race swap as much as this is just another low effort live action remake for Disney that will 100% be a lesser version of the original.

Yep! I've disliked every live action ~~money grab~~ remake so far. They failed to transcend the original in any meaningful way. Or failed to make something new and original. Or they went sideways with the concept that didn't really work for me.

So my current opinion? It'll be a bland remake in the vein of their other attempts to date. I wish people would stop seeing these movies so Disney can are least shuffle their vast resources to other endeavors that may or may not suck, but at least it'll end the parade of stupid pointless ~~money grabs~~ remakes."
"This has become Hollywood PR 101. A million people can dislike something for a perfectly valid reason, but as long you can find a dish toxic people online in some obscure corner who just like it for a bad reason, you can play the victim. Then you act like anybody who doesn’t like you’re a crappy product isn’t progressive enough. 

This is known as the “Ghostbusters Defense”. It’s 100% successful  and can’t be countered. 

***

I’m not surprised that Disney is using this. Frankly I have no confidence in Disney’s ability to do anything, particularly when it comes to a live action remakes from the golden age of Disney. The problem is that they go out of their way to remove any plot elements that are ideologically unacceptable to the Chinese government, while at the same time putting in a couple token progressive points that don’t really offend China like two same sex characters holding hands. 

Let’s take a look at Mulan. The original movie is a flawless and engrossing story about individualism, self determination, and the triumph the sprite of someone who is willing to break all traditional social norms. All of these things are completely antithetical to the Chinese communist party, so all of that was taken away in the remake. 

On top of that, the driving force of the original Mulan is the character arc as she develops from a ditzy klutz who doesn’t know her place in the world to someone who literally changes the world. Well, you can’t have development if you don’t start low and build her up overtime. In order to have a growth you have to start from nothing. But China is really really sensitive about negative portrayals of any of its folkloric euros, so the idea of portraying Hua Mulan  as a clumsy everyman is not something that they’d accept. So instead they gave us this ridiculously overpowered super heroine who starts out the movie inexplicably being a total bad ass and then the whole movie is just her running around killing Mongols like a one woman army. It absolutely sucks ass because there’s no character development arc. 

Why am I bringing all this up now? Because everything that made The Little Mermaid’s plot what it was is *even more* antithetical to China’s ruling party. Ariel represents an oppressed girl in a dreary, constructive society, who dreams of casting off the oppressive social norms of her culture and rising above the surface, seeing the whole world for what it truly is and living in the land where  people are free. This could not be more offensive as a concept to the Chinese government. 

Also there’s some thing that China has a really weird hard-on for censoring, and it’s not homosexuality. For some reason they get really really touchy on lesser animals being depicted as equal to humans. I’ve never understood it, but you can have a movie about animals that talk to each other or you can have a movie about humans - but if you have animals that are sentient  and talking to humans as equals, that really gets their panties in a twist for some reason.

Disney got slammed hard on the western PR front for bending over backwards to appease China. So now they’re putting in a few token progressive points to show that they haven’t forgotten about the rest of the world, but they still really, really want to try to keep that Chinese market open to them as much as they can. They’re probably going to reach some compromises on the version they released to the west, with a few short clips that are pre-agreed-upon to be censored out of the Chinese version. But the heart and soul of the original movie is just not going to be there because it’s too antithetical to the Chinese government."
"Funny thing is, the racists who bitch about this have a point in a way.

Disney is doing this because they are shamelessly appealing to a POC audience, and will call everyone racists if the movie sucks and nobody goes to see it a hundred times like a typical Disney movie."
"Im going to (hope) its not a race issue, as much as its ""playing the race card"" for disney to get more ""diversity dollars"".... it just seems like a cash grab to me... i could really care less what ""nationality"" of fish she is... but that were in an age of shameless reboots to stir up controversy: so that DisneysWorld can cash in on our nations children..."
The frustration is in Disney trying to lump the two together.
"And Im sure you have the same energy for little mermaid 2: return to the see. 

What an “ethics in journalism” type answer."
it honestly feels like they intentionally cast minorities for parts just so they can accuse people of being racist when they get called out on how shit the show/movie is.
I wish they would give minorities their own stories so it’s not just a color swap but has stuff about the culture and things. Something like Moana. It is really low effort the way they’re doing it with this. Having said that it’s nice to see bathe reactions of little black girls and it’s nothing to get outraged over.
"Listen to yourself

“I don’t care MUCH about the race swap”

So it bothers you a little? A medium amount?

Talk about showing your true colors in the first sentence."
"This is the real take here. Everyone getting worked up about a movie we already all know is going to be mediocre at best, regardless of the cast. I couldn't care less about Disney's latest lukewarm reanimated cash cow corpse of a film."
People would care if they race swapped princess Tiana if they ever did a live action princess and the frog
Yeah it's like the backlash to this trailer and just casting direction in general has me really annoyed but also like....... that doesn't mean I'm going to watch the movie.
"Yeah tbh I just watched Maleficent 2 and while it’s not a GOOD movie per se…it was hella enjoyable. 

I think the best live action adaptations have been the ones that put a spin on the animated versions and dont remake them scene for scene. 

Cinderella was great imo. They changed just enough up, kept some nostalgic references, but didnt make it a full blown musical that followed the og scene for scene. 

Maleficent changed it up a bunch which was great to see. Not peak cinema but still a fun watch. 

The Jungle Book, same thing as Cinderella. 

Cruella was fantastic. Probably my favorite so far. They really put a twist on the character and made her backstory, fun, interesting, and meaningful while making her a complex character you’re both rooting for and against.

Beauty and the Beast was fine. It was a well made film. But it was just a replica that thankfully happened to capture a lot of its own magic. 

Aladdin tried to replicate what Beauty and the Beast did but fell flat in a lot of areas and failed to have it’s own magic. 

Lion King was just pointless. It was basically a frame by frame remake of the 2D animated version with little magic. It drained all the magic you’d get out of the stage play or the animated version. 

If anything they should have just gone with making a Mufasa prequel from the get go imo. 

Alice In Wonderland was fun. It was campy, not an A+ film but still brought something different. It was Alice’s return to Wonderland and as adult. It kept the story as something new and added more elements of the original book which was great. 

Mulan was somewhere between Cinderella and Beauty and the Beast. It didnt turn itself into a musical, and fleshed out/changed certain characters which added to the story, but was still missing something. It felt like the movie had a beginning and an end but no real middle. I would still say this is probably in the better half of the live action adaptations.  

Havent seen Dumbo, Lady & the Tramp, or Pinocchio yet but from reviews, they seem to suffer similar issues to Lion King. 

I just hope the Little Mermaid changes shit up enough and maybe incorporates other elements from the original fairytale to make it interesting. I really dont want it to be a frame by frame remake of the animated movie."
"I enjoyed Malificent for similar reasons that I enjoyed Wicked.   Like, a suspiciously similar amount."
"Yep, same here. All aspects will either be ""yep, copied from the original."" All changes will be worse. The movie will be way longer than it needs to be, with a couple original songs nobody will remember, and bastardized versions of the original songs.

And it'll make a billion dollars and continue Disney's money train."
TIL there is a Mufasa movie being made!
"remember everyone, live action is ALWAYS a downgrade from animation."
Maleficent was at least unique. This will a soulless cash grab like the other remakes.
"Yea, but each of these remakes basically gross a billion each.  If people still want these then good for them, they’ll get more with these numbers.  I don’t watch them, but it doesn’t bother me since I’m clearly not the market they’re going after.  If they’re doing good numbers, it keeps people entertained and people employed.  Sounds fine to me."
I mean live action remakes are tough. They usually bomb. But the quality of the movie isn’t what people are upset over here. That’s the problem
The live action remakes need to continue at least until the live action brave little toaster remake.
"The whole movie was the voice performances music and animation, these remakes take two of those and just do the same songs. This kind of criticism will be brushed over though because everyone wants racist responses."
"Anyone who cares about a fictional species being a different race in their cash grab remake needs to get help.

Hate the movie for the same reason all the other live action remakes have been hated: because they’re soulless cash grabs by a behemoth company intent on owning all fiction. 

I didn’t see the Mulan remake and gave zero shits about it. I didn’t see the Jungle Book remake and didn’t care about it. I didn’t see Cruella or Malificent or the Lion King (a movie I have a big soft spot for) or anything else that has been released. And for all it, my reason was not because of the brain dead reasons a loud bunch of people have with this one. It’s because these movies didn’t need to be remade and I wasn’t going to participate in the cash grab."
"I grew up with Ariel being white. But of all the choices, why Ariel? I couldn’t care less if Spider Man was suddenly black.

But will I start WW3 over it? Nope. I will still watch it and don’t mind it at all.

I’ll have to do a one minute explanation to my daughters and that’s it."
The annoying thing to me is that will say that all criticism comes from people that don't like a black Ariel. So they just go ahead with the low effort live action.
"Let's be honest here. Every Disney movie coming out is pretty much advertising for the merchandise. Very low effort. Disney crunched the numbers and realized that if they can now sell white and black skined Ariel toys therefore they need a black actress in the live action movie. 

They also get plenty of free advertising because of the controversy.  Turning Red was a pretty forgettable movie that was seen by people who just wanted to see what the fuss was about. Disney has been pissing off conservative for media coverage.  I expect to see a live action version of Pinocchio with a visible minority playing the lead or having a gay kissing scene."
Literally the only live action I liked was Beauty and the Beast
"The recent Pinocchio CGI/live action is also a huge mess from all the plot changes and, funny enough, it's very inconsistant/ugly CGI for many characters"
"So far, every live action have been garbage, Pinocchio Aladin Mulan, cruella, lion king, dumbo, Cinderella, beauty and the beast… of course this is gonna be shit. But because every other one has been shit"
I dislike race swaps when it's just like 1 person.  Black Ariel is cool if they do the whole family.  If you just swap Ariel it screams low effort.
Tbh yea it’s just another let’s see if we can change up some old shit and have the cash come in thing. Unoriginal af
"Step 1) choose random iconic character 

Step 2) race and or gender swap

Step 3) use low budget and put minimal effort in. 

Bonus: hire writers and directors that have never seen the original 

Step 4) accuse anyone that says said iconic character isn't being portrayed properly as a bigot

Step 5) get that sweet, sweet free advertising by the brain dead people that can't accept it's okay for characters to not change AND the reeeeeeee people that counter

Step 6) ????

Step 7) Profit?!"
">low effort 

Nothing low effort here.  These movies take a lot of effort and coordination to make."
How am I supposed to enjoy a movie if I don’t already know how it ends?
I'm looking forward to the Pitch Meeting for this!!
I literally only care because I want them to make new shit instead of rehashing every movie under the sun in a new medium because they're out of ideas.
I wasn't much of a fan of Mulan either but I appreciated that it wasn't really an adaptation of the cartoon and more its own retelling of the original Hua Mulan story.
Honestly I think they only cast a black actress to drum up controversy and blame racism for poor reviews or performance. Probably even stop some bad reviews from sources who don't want to get attacked for being racist by calling a shit movie a shit movie.
"> …the new Mufasa movie…

The new fucking *WHAT*????"
This is how we know that the producers have no intent of this being about increasing minority representation or some sort of cultural progress. It is simply a cash grab riding on the coattails of nostalgia and social media engagement fueled by controversy.
"They do nothing to make it better. I did the the Cinderella one albeit it felt a bit short, like something was missing. But many seem so low effort."
"Everytime, since the beginning, people complain about movies not targeted to them."
"Exactly! The actress playing Ariel could be purple for all I care.

The horrible special effects are what get me. Ariel’s tail looks fake and her hair isn’t moving enough to give a somewhat accurate feeling of being underwater. I just hope Flounder, Sebastian, et al are better rendered than Disney’s previous subpar adaptations.
Edit: don’t do grammar at 3am"
This is my gripe as well. Just another low effort cash grab. Maybe it will be decent.
Then don't watch it? I know I won't. It's not that hard. I didn't watch any of the others either.
"Heh, I got reported for being suicidal, once.  No idea what comment I made inspired someone to abuse the function like that.

edit - ha, someone reported this one too"
I honestly chalked it up to the hair being shown in a nighttime scene under water. Bad lighting and cgi. Hopefully the hair is a little more vibrant under betting lighting.
"The whole trailer looked way too dark and gloomy. Unrionically kinda spooked me with the underwater segments and the fish tail, something I’d expect from a movie attempting to illustrate how dark fairy tales really are, not a remake of a colorful movie."
"i mean, seriously are people really going to discuss what is the natural hair color of .. mermaids??"
Ariel's hair in the original wasn't a natural shade of red either
">i mentioned on here that my only issue was that her hair wasn't very vibrant…

The deeper you are in the ocean the more muted colors are. Red is the first color to disappear at 15ft."
I mean even if black people could not have red hair.... it's a fucking MERMAID. They're cool with the fish tail but not the red hair? Nah. It's just an excuse to be racist IMO.
"As a black person who has family members who are gingers, I find this funny. 

Malcolm X is one such black person with red hair (not my relative though.)"
"She's a fucking mermaid. Why does any human biology apply to her in the first place? 

They're upset about her skin color. SHE HAS A FISH TAIL.

They're upset about her hair color. SHE'S A FISH PERSON.

They're upset about blah blah blah. SHE. IS. NOT. REAL.

What I think is funny is that it's always grown Men who complain about this shit. You're not going to see the movie anyway! Lol, gtfo of here."
"The racism is crazy online.

Ps— my grandfather was a red haired Native American"
I've know black/biracial people who had natural red hair. People need to stop being such dicks!
"I hate the fact that the support option became the ""superdislike"" feature, it's so insulting, it's like; ""you should feel so bad you must be thinking about offing yourself"""
"Lol, complaining about inaccurate hair color on a mermaid!"
"I got massively downvoted for saying the same and that we redheads aren’t hurting for representation. People are really using the whole redhead thing as a shield. There are tons of things that differ from the original fairytale, including her hair color. From what I’ve heard the only reason it’s read in the first place was because Splash had only come out a few years before and the mermaid in that movie was blonde. And yes, my hair does look more vibrant underwater but that’s not a huge deal to me, or at least not a big enough deal for the vitriol we’re seeing."
Her hair should look brown. Red is the first color you lose underwater. It should be a dull brown underwater and a vibrant red above water.
"I also commented on someone's post saying that it is red, but just a natural shade of red lol.

And about the suicidal reports, what's up with those? I've gotten them twice in a single month, I don't get it."
"Black people also can't have fins or breath underwater, and THAT's what they claim is unnatural?  Any who says Herbal Essences doesn't have an underwater branch? 

I'm decades past the last time I saw a Disney fairy tale in a movie theatre, but I might go see this one.  It looks gorgeous."
Wait til they find out black people can also be white lol
Black people most certainly can have red hair.  From what I remember it’s either someone with some European mixed in or they’re albino.  That said this is a mermaid so she could have purple hair and it would be just as real.  If the kids like the movie that’s all that matters.
They’re not trying to make that poor girl look like a carrot. I’m glad they didn’t
I am black and my grandmother had red hair. Bright red.
It’s a movie. They’re acting. Couldn’t just put on a wig?
Doy black people can't have red hair but they can have fish tails? Got it.
I Don't believe black people have  fish tails either
I'm just glad her hair is red. That's the iconic thing about Ariel to me well besides being a mermaid. I remember when they first announced she would be black soo many people were saying black people can't have long red hair and her hair has to be short black and kinky.
"or also the fact that she lives at the bottom of the ocean where there is not much light, and therefore would have darker hair"
The suicide report is the butthurt racist troll’s version of firing a gun with a flag that comes out of it saying “BANG!”
Black people also can’t have fins
"I got reported for being suicidal last week also, some kids just don’t have a life."
"I mean I would say that Halle’s red hair in the trailer is as vibrant as a natural red you can get. I feel like people just have way too many critiques and emotions over a 30 second preview of a movie that isnt even fully edited or color graded and is still the better part of a year away. 

Like it’s not gonna look super saturated like a cartoon. It’s not a cartoon."
Lol Malcolm X had red hair
"My only issue was her singing, it didn’t really fit the mood of the trailer. Seemed like she was just showing off her singing rather than singing as the character."
Black people can and do have red hair
Black people cant have fins either soooo….i don’t understand all the hate. It’s a fictitious being. Mermaids aren’t real.
"To be fair, the shade of red from the animated movie isn’t real either."
"There are whole legions of people who have a desperate need to set themselves above others, but they're such losers that the only metric they can use for that, and is the one and only thing a chronic fuckup can't fuck up: the race they were born as.

I'll address them now:  You guys come up with all sorts of rationales and inventive excuses,  but you ain't fooling anyone.   Not even yourselves.  You're some of the worlds' foremost losers, and everyone knows it."
IIRC you can report those as abusing the system
These people need to fuck off to the sun.
Why would it matter if it’s not a natural shade for  black people anyway? In the same way her having dark skin shouldn’t be an issue because she’s a fictional mermaid then her having vibrant red hair shouldn’t be either lmao.
Red hair looks darker when it's wet tho
"FYI - If you report the message from Reddit Cares, they’ll investigate the person who originally reported you and likely ban them, or at least that’s what happened when I got a message once (Braves and Mets have been very competitive this season, and idiots brigade the respective opposing sub when the other team loses)"
"In my experience on this website, the same people who say they are for free speech and hate woke culture report my comments and tell Reddit I am suicidal every time I disagree with them."
"Dude... 

I love how the hair color is where they draw the line.

""OMG this fictional fish woman has the wrong color hair!!!""

Like come on."
"So much yes!  She’s a freaking mythical creature, so you can give her fire-engine blindingly red hair.  It’s a fantasy character in a fantasy world, give me fantasy hair."
"I agree, I wish her hair were more vibrant as well. The argument that they are trying to keep it in the natural range is ludicrous. The whole film is a piece of fiction, she's a mermaid! They could give her brighter hair."
"I'm really going out on a limb here, but I know at least 4 black people and *none* of them have a fish's tail either. /s

I'd wager none of the people whining about this had any complaints about ANY of the Caucasian depictions of any character in Egypt or the Middle East, just as a starter.  White washing happens all the time and is much more egregious than this will ever be.  GROW UP."
"I don't care much for the whitewashing or blackwashing of Disney characters, it's not a big deal. 

the erasure of Gingers is not ok. I won't stand for this. My people have suffered enough"
"You cannot say that she should have vibrant red hair. It is racist (from what I’ve seen literally all over the internet, at least)"
My only real issue was when it ends with “part of your world” to me it sounds like she says “wild”.
"What I have a problem with is the actual replacement in a movie that’s already been made.  It’s putting African Americans in the shadows and telling the world hey,,  we can only be popular if we shadow a white person in a remake.  Make some stand alone franchises is all I’m saying like Spawn or the black panther."
"I was thinking the exact same thing! Black, white, whatever, don’t care. Glad they cast someone who fit the part. But Ariel’s hair was RED dammit!!!!"
My complaint would be it doesn’t really look like she’s under water. I get it’s cgi and what have you but still.
"The issue with this is complaining when so many racist and hateful folks are also saying the same thing you are because they don't want to admit that they just hate her being black. Does this mean you're racist? Nope. But it does mean you're saying the same things they say so there's no way to know what side you're on when hypercriticizing a black woman who is already getting so much hate.

Also, she's a fish. Who cares if she her hair isn't super shiny"
"Yep. It happened with GoT, Star Wars, Ring of Power, House of Dragons etc... if you dislike the material for whatever reason, they immediately discount your opinion as a bigot, misogynist and racist. You can't dislike a source material that's capitalizing on being inclusive for any reason"
"Wait, like natural red hair? Not dyed?"
I had always assumed when I saw people with that hair color that they were coloring it so I learned something today.
Black people can’t have red hair…on a mermaid. And what are the normal features for a mermaid then?
">i linked an article stating that yes, black people can in fact have red hair

link it again, i'm curious."
"Holy shit I got two of those. They’re out there. 

And they vote."
"Being seeing that everywhere too, like that is how you know the racism is their only drive. Didn’t we all learn Punnett squares in middle school? Red hair is like the first example given and someone always asks about black peoples and red hair in those classes.

I ended up taking a good amount of biology for my major and that was like the main question always asked, and recessive genes can work in weird ways for sure"
"Just to be sure that you are not suicidal, should I ask them to check in with you?"
They are reprehensible and take any and every advantage.  They did that to me once too.  Felt they lost the argument and pulled that nonsense.
suicidal reports. I get those all the time. It’s a last ditch effort to get you off reddit. Don’t worry. It means you won the fight
I had this happen too... definitely not from the same point of view either.   Must be the latest fad.
"I bet they'd say folks in Afghanistan can't have red hair because they're arabs.

Despite a large chunk of the population having red hair and green eyes.

And *not being Arabs.*

Ignorant racists are everywhere."
"It's just a teaser, and I'm expecting nothing more than a bad xerox copy of the original film, but visually what we've seen so far has looked fine to me.

Except Flounder. Them going for uber-realistic fish is going to really counter what I said previously. Just a bunch of dead-eyed emotionless sea creatures swimming around human characters."
"There are 31 countries that we know of that use troll farms. People are literally paid to be ""those"" people online."
"I hated it because of how dark it was, showed nothing about the movie except her swimming through pitch black tunnels. 

Not a very exciting trailer at all, more of a teaser than anything"
"My FIL has red hair.

Although, he probably could have legitimately passed back in his childhood"
A kid in my HS said he had red hair as a kid and nobody in our hick school believed him since he was black. He brought in a photo the next day to prove everybody wrong. Bright red curly hair.
My friends with natural red hair have specifically stated that their favorite thing so far is that the color of her hair looks natural. I guess they’re tired of all the unnaturally bright reds and oranges that often appear in cartoons and movies.
If a black woman can have a fish tail I don’t see why vibrant red hair should be a stretch.
"lol Jesus, that last sentence made me laugh. People are crazy… especially when proved wrong. I have a family member who is black with red hair. Yes it’s a more natural red, not vibrant red because he’s a human not a cartoon."
"I was reported suicidal recently over a comment, I guess the “fuck your feelings” group aren’t as tough as they think."
Guess they never heard of Sinbad. Or Malcolm X.
"I love being reported for being suicidal.  

It's why my favorite band is suicidal tendencies"
Even if black people couldn't have red hair why is that where the line is drawn? Black people can't have fish tails but that's ok apparently
They have white genes somewhere in their history.
"Reddit 100% knows whose abusing the report function. Mods don’t, but admins sure do. There should be a report this report option, and admins should ban anyone that clearly abuses the report."
 Be happy for it only being suicidal.  I once got reported for distribute child porn by some ass hat that didn't like my opnion.
"Somebody did that to me, too. Sad douche wads."
As far as I’m aware black people can’t have fish tails either
"Damn I thought that was just me. I wasn't a fan of the dreads(clump?) As well as the brown color hair. Just looks like shit, litterally. If it was a bright red and straight it would look so much better imo. I thought the point of having that hair in mermaid was so that when they swim it looks magical"
Black mermaids can.
I think the hair probably just isn’t that vibrant but it being an underwater scene was what made it look brown. I think it’s going to be a very understated red.
Black people can be natural red heads. I know a few. Not certain where you are getting this from. https://newsone.com/4359782/black-people-with-red-hair-origin/amp/
Actually people of all races on Earth can have red hair it's one of those traits that doesn't actually belong exclusively to one ethnic group (almost like...every human trait)?
I got reported for being suicidal for comments on ROP as well. Literally objective critiques about the pacing of the show.
If you report someone online as suicidal just because they disagree with you then you are a deeply disturbed person who is a net negative on the world.
"I mean, some of these things make bank, so someone wants them.

I prefer the cartoons myself, or when they make weird reinterpretations of them like the Peter Pan 'Hook' movie with Robin Williams."
"If kids movies you didn’t ask for annoy you, you will spend the rest of your life annoyed. They don’t end."
"Kids are the target audience, not you."
"> Just wished they stopped making live action remakes no one asked for. The originals are fine.

https://www.boxofficemojo.com/chart/top_lifetime_gross/?area=XWW"
"I heared they do it for old expiring copyrights.
Dump out any live action garbage and you can claim the rights again."
"This is what I feel most.

It feels like tokenization, in the sense they give us the same movie, make some small tweak, and positive or negative, they know it will generate attention, and sure enough its all people are talking about.

But does anyone need this story, again?  The same story?  The one retold a thousand times since the 1800s, many times by the same damn company producing the new one?

Go weird with it if youre going to do it.  Give us Little Mermaid a la Quentin Tarantino.  Give us R rated Little Mermaid.  George RR Martin Little Mermaid with black Ariel and Jack Black Ursula.

Produce something *different.*  Something with purpose or meankng that changes or evolves the source material in a relevant way.

Now of course the millions of racists out there are going to say this is why *they* dislike the movie, but we all know damn fucking well a remake with Taylor Swift in a red wig would produce *ambivalence* from the trolls, not troll activism in the form of bot swarming and downvoting.

So we can have both.  We can have a clearly racist minority of the viewing clearly throwing a tantrum about race, while at the same time this still being a lazy cash grab by an increasingly lazy and unimaginative corporation that would rather rehash than take on the risk of imnovating."
This so much. Like it's so obvious all the live action remakes are just for cash grabs instead of making new contents.
This is the best comment I’ve read here!
"I am just a white man, but I found your comment funny and relatable."
It would be so much better if they went back to using original stories. [Sukey and the Mermaid](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1110093.Sukey_and_the_Mermaid) would be amazing turned into a movie.
">Just wished they stopped making live action remakes no one asked for

If Mermaid flops as badly as Mulan maybe they will, but Disney could barely be blamed for continuing a business model that was yielding billion-dollar-plus box office returns.  Clearly someone was asking for them - or at least paying for them."
They gotta find a way to monetize that content again.
The mouse needs to feed
These are made so they can keep the rights to the original ip. It's kinda like refreshing copyright.
Yeah but money
"If I remember correctly, the only reason they’re pushing out the live remakes is so the copyright doesn’t expire on their IPs."
"I think it was in Walt Disney's will that the films be remade ever so often so that the next youngest generations can experience it for themselves.

... I guess he did die before even VHS cassette players were commonplace in households, thus I could understand this from a theatrical perspective. But, now that we have on-demand players that don't even require physical media, these films can be enjoyed by just about every generation."
They (Disney) found a letter from Walt saying how he never wanted live remakes of animated works. He thought it took away from the magic of the original animated movies.
SUS. I keep reading this same exact quote from numerous user accounts. Dean Browning effect?
Personally I'm APPALLED that not even one of the mermaids is eating a sailor's marrow. It's total erasure.
"To Disney's credit, at least they chose to go with an actress who looks like a fish"
"If that was the only problem, they made her a fish on the bottom, human on top mermaid. Give me fish on the top, human on the bottom mermaid Disney, you COWARDS!!!!

The best comment here!!!
This comment needs more attention.
The overlap between people making a big fuss over the casting and people who were going to watch the movie is zero.
Humans putting all those hard-working [Deep Ones](https://lovecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Deep_One) out of jobs.
"i think that’s the point. people like you (and other causal viewers) may dislike the concept, but you’re probably not going to go out of your way to dislike the video. it’s weird that this remake has gotten the most dislikes out of all their most recent, crappy adaptations (like mulan, which was already hugely hated before it came out and it didn’t get nearly as many dislikes as this). at this point it’s hard to look at the intense reactions to this trailer as anything but racism."
"Honest question for you, then.  What of Disney’s movies WOULD translate well to live action?  They all more or less follow the same formula, are all colorful and vibrant and expressive, and feature memorable songs."
"Looks like a horror film tbh.

I also wanted more lights. Glowing fish etc.

What a let down before it's even out."
Umm what? The only colorful parts of the animation were the “Under the Sea” musical number and when she was on land. Everything else was pretty blue and dark green for most of the movie with the occasional gold for when they were in the palace lol.
"I don't understand why people keep making this comment. The scene they showed was a few seconds, not the trailer for the whole movie. There is a side by side comparison of the scene with the animated movie and it's identical. The premise of the scene seems to be she lives ""under the sea"" and she's reaching out to the surface where she prefers to be and is ""brighter."" They captured that scene well. I'm not sure why people are assuming the rest of the movie won't be vibrant."
"I chuckled at the audible big deep breath while underwater. But I agree, it's a colorful vibrant movie. Hopefully we see more of those colors."
Everyone’s a critic
I don’t see a problem with dinghy lighting in a sea movie.
"The preview was just the song part of that world? Yeah, thats a dark and dingy scene in the [animation.](https://youtu.be/SXKlJuO07eM)"
Yeah I just think it’s another bad live action remake.
Agreed this really doesn’t translate well. The second she started singing I was like oh no this doesn’t work. I can suspend my disbelief with animation that the characters can talk and sing underwater but it just doesn’t work for me with live action. How is she breathing? How is sound traveling? It just broke my disbelief immediately.
"This was my issue with Lion King as well. When I think of Lion King I think of bright, vibrant colors. The whole movies was a dingy brown grey I was so thrown off."
"I could get behind bioluminescence. The one thing that would've made the most sense in my opinion would be if she had short hair or dreads. I get it, it's Disney, it's meant to be magical and not real, but come on, if you're going to do a live-action remake that you want to be as believable as it can for a fantasy world, then why would you have long straight hair? Long hair isn't efficient for underwater living. I wanna see short hair that isn't going to get tangled up in a fish the moment you swim by it (using your long hair as a sort of fish net would be cool I guess, but think if how much stuff it's going to get caught on)."
"That scene from the animated movie is at night time. So this is a relatively realistic “night time under the sea” lighting situation. It’s also a rather sad song. She’s lamenting that she cannot have that which she most desires. I do think bioluminescence would be cool, but this scene has a different mood from sparkle."
"Colors and animation style/speed don't always translate to live action.  

Imagine a zany Looney Tunes cartoon done live action."
Its going to translate just fine.  Disney master movie makers know what they are doing.
Plus: UNDA DA SEE!
The only reasons Disney keeps making these is the trend of these live action movies making a ton of cash from people who will simply see them without a second thought along with extending their copyright on these properties. Its going to be a sad decade or two for animation fans.
"I mean, it's a teaser, I wouldn't assume the whole movie will be quite as murky, definitely won't be as vibrant as a cartoon though, but I'm fine with that."
Disney Marvel sure hate vibrancy and saturation
"Tbf, we're only seeing a brief glimpse of her underwater area.  I have a feeling the colors will be more vibrant when she visits land."
"I think the movie is going to be pretty vibrant. But the dark and dull sea is gonna contrast with the bright and vibrant land. In the animated movie, it never made sense to me why she would want to leave. The ocean looks amazing! Colorful, vibrant, fun! Every fish is bright! Every piece of coral is stunning! Why would she feel *such* a strong desire to go to the surface, when the ocean already has everything and more? Maybe it’s because I come from Broadway land or something, but I’m looking forward to this adaptation. We don’t have many stories that take place in the spooky sea; and if we do they’re horror movies. I think it’s gonna be cool. I don’t have much hope for Ursula though. I think *that* is what is gonna tank the movie."
"I’m hoping that a lot of them were merely pissed at how the film looks so dreary and dark. I’m hoping it’s actually going to be brighter. But no matter what, once that young woman opens her mouth to sing, it’s going to be glorious. She has such an incredible voice."
It does not? That’s an estimate extrapolated from the sample of people who download an extension.
brb going to thumbs up the video
"It's abhorrent tbh. You can forget how important representation is when you are white. I mean, as a kid I had 2 blondes, a brunette, a raven haired AND a red haired princess to pick from. I didn't consider the over abundnace of representation I had (WP at play right there).

I keep seeing montages of black kids reacting to the trailer with so much joy and surprise. That alone says how important representation is.

And yet, white people are kicking off at having one of the MAAAANY that they can pick to relate to no longer looking like them?

It's gross. I didn't have much opinion before tbh, aside from being annoyed a remake was happening which is sure to not stand up to the original. Now? I applaud it completely."
Who gives a flying fuck?
And deservedly so.
1.4 million people probably being motivated by the race swap is scary.
All racists will mutiple accounts...those dislikes can be ignored.
That is a lot of attention.
"1,400 thousand."
"that's just one thousand four hundred thousands, though."
Dozens and dozens of dislikes!
"I imagine a lot of guys in their 20's to 40's disliking the trailer, a movie made for little girls."
"Most coral reefs are closer to the equator and tropical areas.

What were they expecting? Florida keys mermaid?"
The skin color of a magical fish person. That’s the hill they wanna die on
"Between this and the Rings of Power idiocy it is truly sad to see just how alive and well racism is in this country. Even on a lot of Reddit, tons of upvoted comments that are simply racist or xenophobic views packaged into a semi coherent statements involving “lore” or “lack of explanation”, when in reality it’s my fellow white people just upset a character in a fantasy universe is not their same skin tone. It’s pretty pathetic."
"It’s always over some fantasy shit, where, technically, they could be any color….because it’s *fantasy*."
I am a 38 year old man and I care very much about Ariel.
This happened last month in the Guilty Gear community when they released a newly trans character (Bridget) - tons of people who never touched the game crying out about retconned lore and whatnot.
"*Racist people

Ftfy"
I’ve never met a person in real life who cares about this. I’ve heard more about the “outrage” than the actual outrage.
"They really don't understand the *entire point of the movie*, do they? It's that race don't matter. Love can transcend every barrier."
Why change her skin colour? We have the original metric. Why replace it? How does it serve the story?
"This is a very exaggerated interpretation of people making fun of a shitty movie for trying to get attention with an obviously-pandering race swap.

Studios don't do stuff like this with films they think are going to do well, lmao"
"You’re kidding yourself if you think this is just about the little mermaid and skin colour. This is just another example of lazy, dispassionate film making from Disney. Instead of using their billions to take risks and fund actually creative, new and original ideas, they’re pouring it into resurrecting already great classic franchises, turning them into live action and reducing them to statements in whatever political argument is popular at the moment because that will obviously get the most attention. That’s what annoys me at least.

Aside from Pixar, Disney pretty much has no affiliation with productions that genuinely prioritize good storytelling anymore. For people that care about film making, Disneys massive influence is what’s hurting the industry today."
"This but for all the times a movie was ""too white."""
Can you point to an actual single person willing to die on this hill?
It's really weird that so many people are so shook over it but Disney knows exactly what they're doing.
On both sides of this stupid hill too
Ever worn a red swimsuit in the pool before?  Red is the first color to disappear as you go deeper.
"What do you mean you didn't like Mulan?

You know how many Chinese Uyghur Muslim slaves Disney used so you could enjoy a nice traditional Chinese movie? Ungrateful...
\s"
Because they’re always god awful. Disney needs to leave them animated.
"I'm willing to bet if it were just a regular 'non race-swapped' boring ol' reboot, it wouldn't have nearly as many dislikes or negative comments. Not even remotely."
Also it looks like it’s gonna be mostly a shitty CGI remake.
Okay but the reaction to this is a lot different and a lot more severe than the other pointless reboots. There’s definitely a big elephant in the room this time around.
But it just happens to be the pointless remake with the race change rather than any of the other pointless remakes?
That's where I am
"There aren't that many people that'll go outa their way for another reboot.  You're giving racists too much credit.  

If you wanna play that game, you could pretend its a bunch of hardcore feminists against teaching young girls to change for a man too.

That ain't what's going on here friend."
Yeah but majority of people bitching are bitching cause she’s black
"You don't have to be racist to dislike an iconic character being changed. I bet that these live adaptions would get just as much if not even more hate if someone changed a black female original character to a white male. It's just very obvious that they intentionally went out of their way to cast someone different looking from the already iconic disney redhead character. There are plenty of dark skinned characters in the disney universe, why not just make a movie about them instead?"
"If the story is a good story, there’s nothing pointless about putting a new version in theaters for new audiences to see."
This has 100% been Disney’s strategy ever since Star Wars. When their shitty cash grabs blow up in their face (like we see here) they can pin the blame on the audience by spinning the wheel of -ism’s
Adults are not the target audience. They dont have to dislike or even watch the trailer.
If you just hate pointless reboots why would you even watch the trailer?
"Ok but 1.5 million…

We know why the large majority of that is for… its literally record breaking."
"Thing is, none of the people who hate such a thing are the target audience, Disney doesn’t care that adults who were not going to watch hate them. Banking on old nostalgia is profitable but creating new one is even more so."
"Umm, don’t watch them?"
"One by one we get to watch our childhood favourites dragged out, strung up like a piñata and beaten senselessly until the money stops falling out.

But the money keeps coming.  People watch these films in droves, nostalgia bait has become the go-to cinema formula.

All the outrage etc. just feels like Disney manufactured BS designed to generate visibility and engagement.  

Representation is important and I think the benefits are still there regardless of intent.  Still, somehow I don't think Disney execs are altruistic in their motives here.  Capitalising on culture war BS and laughing all the way to the bank with it while twitter runs the worlds largest promotional campaign for them, free of charge."
"That's probably true, but your average Joe just wouldn't give enough of a fuck about it to go view it and give it a dislike. These people are going out of their way to dislike it. That hints at something else going on IMO"
"Yes, that’s simply it. That’s why this one is so disproportionately downvoted despite all the other pointless reboots."
Good point. But the biggest factor is race.
"And that’s fine - but the vast majority of people with that gripe aren’t going to download an extension to dislike it , or post some 5 paragraph long thing saying something like that but then ending it with some double speak racist shit."
They can’t even cast Asians in roles of Asian characters in many instances.
My cousin is an Asian actor and he’s talked about how hard it is for Asian men to get roles. I honestly want to make a movie just so he can star in it
I can’t name ten anything that aren’t Jackie Chan to be fair.
Like 30% of the US is Hispanic and they get even less lead roles
Isn’t the stats showing that white and black people are overrepresented in Hollywood while every other race is underrepresented?
"Exactly. Where are our Asian/Pacific Islander lead actresses/actors??? I would love to see a Filipino on the big screen! When Disney finally makes a movie about South Eastern Asians, it was just an amalgamation of a handful of SEA countries with no specific ethnicity. To me that just seems like a lazy approach. Like some kind of catch-all for Asians. I still loved Raya, don't get me wrong. She's my Filipino princess even though she's not a specific SEA ethnicity. Tbh, having a Filipino Ariel living off the coast of the Philippines would have been a great idea imo, the inspiration coming from the Filipina Marvel heroine Wave. 
Not surprised you got immediately shut down for asking that question. Asians are more underrepresented yet not much is being done to fix that."
This would make more sense! I could see a Polynesian or pacific islander  actress play Ariel. Maybe in the next remake!
"Yeah, as a Hispanic I get bugged out that most white roles are replaced by seemingly only black actors. What!? Are blacks the only minority race in the eyes of Hollywood execs?!!!

Edit: I don’t want Hispanics to replace the whites. I’d prefer original roles. I don’t like being pandered to."
"[Ariel was played by an Asian woman named Diana Huey in the onstage version and people were pissed, so probably.](https://www.huffpost.com/archive/ca/entry/asian-ariel-little-mermaid_a_23156090)"
Asian Americans need a lot more representation overall
I genuinely feel bad for AAPI people. The representation is quite low. I also wonder if the reaction would be the same.
"Would they cast a Pacific Islander or Asian?

This is done for money, and in the current climate, this is an easy way for companies to generate a buzz and sell product."
"Ooh, I would love to see a Korean Ariel. Those guys/gals pull off red hair so well."
"Michelle yeoh, Bruce Lee, jet li, simu limu, Lucy Lou, awkwafina, Tony Leung, chow young fat then I googled Asian actors and the only other one I really recognized was Constance wu which I am disappointed in myself for not remembering who"
"Hispanics are a larger minority btw.

The obvious issue here is people are tried of the obvious race swapping and baiting.

It's literally intentional. Low budget with a no body in the lead role. Yet has this massive coverage. Wow. Shocker. Disney isn't known for its insane targeting or marketing."
"According to literally every study ever done on Earth Black people experience more racist encounters than every other race.

So if we translate that to like vs dislikes i would assume the numbers would be different."
"I think if they did get a pacific islander character most people  might still not recognize it. But even still the number might look bad because it's *another* Disney live action movie that just looks downright worse that the original. 

Aside from that the actor herself just doesn't look the part, and when you've got people calling her sid the sloth... Jeez man I dunno."
"There also are a lot of other red headed characters for kids these days. 

Ariel is not even the only Disney princess with red hair anymore. Merida, Ariel, and Anna have red hair. And expanding just slightly Jesse from toy story, Mrs Incredible, Jessica rabbit, misty from pokemon, Jessie from pokemon, daphne from scooby doo, Wilma Flintstone, poison ivy,  ginny weasley, heck Megara from Hercules is questionable etc. 

But also... the Ariel cartoon you know and love... still exists. Not directed at you, but even that criticism falls apart these days. Also I guarantee all the little [black girls geeking out](https://www.reddit.com/r/MadeMeSmile/comments/xcek0b/black_parents_on_social_media_are_sharing/) over this film, also like the old little mermaid."
Didn't they race swap Annie too? What do the studios have against redheads?
"It's not about her skin colour in general, it's about remakes using ""woke"" as a crutch, alot of people hate the woke movement because it makes for awful films, think ghostbusters or terminator dark fate.

Was it really so hard to just make a different film with this same actor, I mean it really can't be that hard to make a movie based on a princess aimed at 5-15 year Olds and I think thats what the issue is."
"<3

Sad part is the movie will be review bombed worse than Captain Marvel or whatever with Brie.  

Female plus black?  Yeah be ready for the worst review bomb a movie has ever seen.  The racists and incels are going to be teaming up for this one."
"Too bad little girls nowadays won't have an Ariel to look up to. 

We don't need to be so docile just to show we are not racists."
"I agree with this! I didn’t have red hair but she was white and so am I, so I was represented. And I love her so much. Seeing the videos of the little black girls’ eyes lighting up is lovely to see. I, too, am happy to share Ariel."
"Don't you think it's more valuable for a girl to have a princess that is alike, as an original? As opposed to say, a red hair and pale Pocahontas?"
"> When the casting first broke I had a split second of disappointment that the live action version wouldn’t look like me. And then I realised that that was the situation thousands and thousands of black girls had growing up, except they didn’t have an Ariel then. So, I’m happy and honoured to share her.

This is exactly what happened with my red-headed wife. Ariel is, obviously, her favourite Disney princess, and for a moment she felt sad for having that ""lack of representation"" that made her feel so special when she was a kid, but then immediately realized that there was going to be a whole new group of young girls who will now feel represented because of this film, and it will help them just as the original helped her.

I don't think the movie looks good based on the trailer that we've seen (having nothing to do with Ariel's skin colour), but it's hard to argue with the representation and what it will mean to young girls (but goddamn if people are trying)."
And the girls that look like you did get left behind
Jamaican crab? I sleep. Black mermaid? This is obscene
in a movie targeted at children that they likely had no intention of watching nonetheless
A sister was black and the crab was Jamaican.  They're fucking insane.
"Nah, it’s just another shitty live action.

I’d totally be down for a classic 2D animated spinoff of the little mermaid where the main character is black"
I can understand cuz they made fictional Jesus white.
the iconic ginger disney princess... soo many ginger kids grew up identifying with her.  of course people are gonna be mad when you try to change their icons.
"I think it is just a very, very small handful that are loud. Media loves to eat it up and race bait. I couldn’t care less and I think most people the same. It’s a kids movie and will suck because all live action remakes have been bad."
"They're racist. They've been bitching about every single person of color in every single show/movie lately, it's getting so ridiculous."
"It’s a super important issue…..

Yes I’m being sarcastic, sad that I have to clarify this LOL"
"People can pretend that Jesus was white, for some reason the skin tone of a mermaid is a step too far."
"I realize the inevitability of this comment being downvoted into oblivion, but if some conservative-leaning film studio (like whoever made that shitty ""My Son Hunter"" movie) decided to make a movie where the Black Panther was played by a white guy (ignoring copyright for the sake of the underlying point), could they just defend it by saying ""people are really so pressed that an imaginary superhero is white""?"
"I mean didn't they have just about the same reaction to having to ""endure"" a black president? These are just the loud minority party over country nutjob racists and probably even trump followers... so is it any wonder?"
Maybe it's the decades of browbeating especially recently with casting complaints in movies like Ghost in the Shell that made people reactionary.
"It’s art, it’s not attempting to directly influence public policy; what have you done in the past when you don’t care for a piece of art? If anything, this situation reminds me of Warhol’s Campbell’s Soup Cans, considering the amount of controversy it’s creating. It’s interesting to see."
"The original movie is part of American culture as are many Disney movies. Imagine if a movie was made about Martin Luther King, but he was played by a white dude, or Elvis Presley played by a Chinese guy. It would be confusing and upsetting to many people."
"I agree and celebrate the representation.  I don't care if the Danish are upset that Disney appropriated their folklore.  Like you said, it's imaginary.

I'm also looking forward to the inclusion of other minorities such as Asians, Indians and Gingers to Wakanda Forever!"
I’m only confused bc Disney has a black princess that they could have used her as bc when I think Ariel I think pale white skin and bright red hair. They also announced that the little mermaid was going to be black when they were being called out for being racist and xenophobic. I think personally disney is trying to virtue signal just like companies do during pride month
Which people??
Reverse the roles and you’ll change opinion in an instant.
"Are there racists who dislike it because it’s a (light skinned) black Mermaid? Sure, but that’s not the story here. It’s the pandering aspect and the live action remake to make a quick buck."
"so quick to assume the over 1 million dislikes are because of that, many people are complaining about how bad it looks, nothing to do with race."
wait until they find out the Little Marmaid was originally inspired by the original author's internalized homosexuality.

"This is a big one for me. I fucking love redheads. Give me that bright, ridiculously vibrant red hair. Stop race swapping away all my damn redheads you bastards."
"Cue the ""but black ppl can be redheads too"" and yet I've never seen a real redhaired black person in my life."
It worked in Shawshank Redemption…
I think so. I was upset in the flash that they didn't make wally and iris into redheads.
Are you 12? This is a movie for little kids. Grow up
It's not a good film outside of the animation and 2 songs.  The plot is actually kinda terrifying even for 1989.
Lets be honest it wasnt a good movie. They mke ariel a dumb bimbo when she doesnt need to be. No self respecting person would give up their fucking voice to get legs so they can be with a man. How the fuck is she supposed to communicate with him? When him with good looks? The plot is dumb af
Are they really living that deep if there are a bunch of colorful fish and coral reefs around?
"Scientifically crabs and seagulls don't talk either which is why I refused to watch the animated movie as a child, absolute nonsense and I won't partake"
I mean scientifically speaking u wouldn't be able to hear her singing so clearly underwater either.
"Wait… are you saying that scientifically, a half-fish, half-woman hybrid wouldn’t have that shade of skin color? 

What the…??"
I’m not sure how this works but if someone was born black they would still be black even with the lack of sunlight? Maybe their skin lightens a little bit but their skin color would still be dark right?
Are you really scientifically analyzing the skin color of a half-fish humanoid that lives without oxygen?
"Well realistically from experience as a scuba diver you can’t see red after a certain (pretty shallow) depth anyway, the red color disappears. So Ariel would have greenish looking hair while underwater as well lol"
Majority from racists/bots made/used by racist people
" “It is essential to the storytelling of Hamilton that the principal roles, which were written for nonwhite characters (excepting King George), be performed by nonwhite actors,” 

I don't have an issue with it, there was a message Hamilton was trying to convey with their casting...but they were definitely casting for race."
"The casting for Hamilton VERY specifically castes for race, as per official statements"
"Funnily enough, Hamilton is about the only musical that casts based on race/ethnicity (cast members have to be non-white, or had to be at least, except for king George). Fully agree with your point though."
As if any of these people would leave their house to go watch a musical
"I thought the whole point of Hamilton was that the actors were the wrong race. Like I thought that was the joke. 

I didn’t watch it so forgive me if I’m wrong."
And Daveed Diggs is in it as Sebastian.  And Lin Manuel Miranda is rumored to be playing the chef.
Funny enough I don’t remember any outrage about skin color back in 1997 when Brandy played Cinderella and had a white stepmother and stepsister. Not to mention her prince was Asian with a mom that was black and a father that was white. I didn’t hear people freaking out back then but then again there wasn’t YouTube or Reddit. But people are acting like this is a new thing to switch things up when it is not.
I'm surprised Sebastian is even in the film. I'm just picturing a hyper-realsitic animated red crab...and the horror of watching it sing. Oh my god. It'll be so awful if they go the Lion King route...
"The people acting like they care about the original are full of it… the original was a love letter written by a queer man to his crush. (Hans Christian Andersen was bi-romantic) And the mermaid commits suicide in the end, sooo"
">and broadway hasn’t been casting based on race for several years now

I think the counter argument is that Disney *is* casting based on race in this case. That they specifically want to cast black leads for inclusivity purposes (or more cynically, for free advertising via the rage cycle - sometimes called ""stunt casting"")."
People bothered by this recasting aren’t going to watch Hamilton.
Ones a voice actor for one of the easiest accents to do. The other one you can see and she doesn’t look like the original. It is not the same
"The first 15 or so minutes of Hamilton I was genuinely salty. None of these folks would have rapped, most probably owned future rappers.

Once I got out of my own ignorance and suspended reality it became one of my favorite stage plays ever. You can find me just about any day in the office singing:


“I…… I wanna be in the room where it happens, the room where it happens.”"
The guy is white.
But that’s Carribean erasure. Isn’t that more your guys’s thing to get mad about?
"Because Sebastian was a crab in the original cartoon, he can be translated to any human race for his voice acting for all I care. Same for Aladdin and the Genie, played by Will Smith, a black actor in our world.    
It's not the race that matters, but the worlds perception of what Ariel was marketed as for the past 30 years- a light skinned, red headed mermaid with a green tail and purple bikini. Bailey having dark skin doesn't fit with the worlds image of Ariel that has been established and reinforced for the past 30 years.
Appropriately, if Mowgli was a light skinned India kid (who could be mistaken as racially white) in the  Jungle Book remake it would also look out of place like how Ariel is here."
"there's a vid of her and her sister singing the national anthem and it's like.. they legit sound like angels , i was shook they are sooo talented"
She is an amazing vocalist.  Her cover of “Can You Feel the Love Tonight” is incredible.  Her and her sister are both crazy talented.
"I haven’t personally been a huge fan of the live action remakes, although all the kids in my life love them so there’s gotta be something there. 

Hearing just a snippet of Halle Bailey’s “Part of Your World” made me tentatively optimistic that this one might be good??

If nothing else, just from that snippet she’s got such a rich and beautiful sound, I’m looking forward to hearing the whole thing."
1 trailer/1 thought ratio seems like a stable strategy going forward
"Her voice is beautiful, but it's totally wrong for the role. Ariel is 16. Her innocence and youth are absolutely essential to the character. 

For Jodi Benson's performance in the original, Howard Ashman kept coaching her to give her singing a younger tone. Ariel needed to have more youthful sense of wonder, and far less polish than Benson had as a highly trained singer. Miss Bailey's voice is far too mature and polished."
They finally chose someone that can act AND sing. Her and her sister are amazing live performers too!
She's a multimillionaire with 3 million instagram followers and a gorgeous life style. She'll be fine. She's also entirely self made.
There are more posts about the backlash than people actually annoyed about her as Ariel.
"Not trying to start a fight, by my niece said she ""doesn't look like her [meaning Ariel]"" so like...yeah some kids will care. Some won't. They definitely aren't saints though."
FOR REALLLL
"bro,she looks like hammerhead shark,unironically best cast for mermaid"
Gingers?
They are the same people that were never going to watch the movie anyway.
"I wasn't surprised to see Russian comments in the top under the trailer. They won't be able to watch the movie properly at all, but they still rage about the MC."
"Look, they're not racist, they just happen to think it's unrealistic to have a black elf, dwarf, or mermaid."
"Having nothing to do with casting at all, the reality is disney live action remakes have all been bad, and this turns the timeless classic into a cash grab that will be lesser than the original."
People suddenly really concerned about the sincerity of it. They just want your money!!!!! Yes. Disney has always been a business.
Out of curiosity if they casted the black panther with a white actor would you care?
"Actually, people who don't find issues with this are the ones with small minds. They're the ones susceptible to the heavy woke propaganda that's prevalent in society. Deliberately casting a black woman for a white woman's role is actually racist."
"It’s a small-minded world, after all!"
"[Hey, don’t paint me with that brush!](https://i.imgur.com/dnPTxgw.jpg)"
"Oh, which ones? Where have they expressed said issues?"
"That would be interesting. I got real upset because some redditor said she should be pale because underwater= less sun= less melanin. Like bro, have you seen any marine animals? Most of the deep sea fish are black or dark colored and they see zero sunlight. If they were pale they'd stick out and get eaten. Most marine mammals are brown or gray or countershaded. Orcas are famously black and white.   Sorry for the tangent. 

 I'm trying to imagine what a ""realistic"" mermaid would look like but how far would we take the changes? Realistically, a half fish half mammal is impossible. It's got to be one or the other and the decision will impact almost every facet. A mammal with a few fish-like qualities seems more likely than the reverse so let's start there. If she is a mammal then probably no scales. There are some scaled mammals like the pangolin but none in the ocean. You're on the right track about hair. The mermaid would likely be bald. Sea otters have longish fir but they mostly reside on the surface. Seals have shorter fur, while whales are hairless. Unless our mermaid is covered in fur completely she'd be fully bald. Head fins seem unlikely. The only cephalic fins I can think of is the manta ray which uses them for feeding. 

As a mammal she needs to surface to breathe. So she probably isn't an ambush predator, she'd give away her hiding place whenever she runs out of oxygen. So how does she eat? Let's assume she's omnivorous as humans are. If she is a filter feeder like baleen whales she'll spend her whole day swimming horizontally. If she is a more conventional predator she'll also swim primarily horizontally. So her neck should attach at the back of her neck like most animals rather than the bottom like a human's. Otherwise she'll be blind above her. And if she is thus oriented she'll probably be countershaded. Light gray or white on her front/bottom and black/blue/dark grey/brown on her back/top. 

Back to the question of predation. How does she catch her prey? Do we assume she has ""human"" hands that are used for catching prey? If so she can't also use them to swim and her tail will need to make up for it somehow. Posterior limbs are used for steering while swimming in most species. If not she'll need a longer jaw and sharper teeth to catch fish. 

Does she have a blowhole? 

Idk, I'm probably wrong on a few points but I've already spent too much time thinking about this."
Yep. My almost four year old granddaughter is going to go nuts for this. She’s obsessed with mermaids.
It’s literally this simple and I can’t believe grown ass people are making this a such a big issue. A large majority of kids movies aren’t at all made for adults to enjoy
We had 101 dalmatians the live action movie in the mid-90s and most people love that one. I think it’s just a case of people making a big deal out of nothing
"Eh. This kind of thing happens all over the place. Something comes out, some years later tech has advanced, that thing is remade with the new tech. Even music. Jimmy Page remastering Led Zeppelin albums, for example. Or in another way, Eric Clapton has two versions of Layla that became hits, the original and the acoustic rendition. There's nothing wrong with putting out multiple artistic visions of the same fundamental piece of media."
"Well it keeps the property alive, and if they animated it it’s hard to avoid paying the animators - but with actors you can do creative accounting to pretend the movie lost money so you never actually have to pay anyone."
Kids haven't seen the classic.
Is she dumb because she's 4 or dumb because she thinks Ariel has always been black?
"They’ll find any reason to hate and say, “it’s not because of her skin color! I don’t like this because…” Like just stop"
Lmaooo they are trying to cancel halle... for being black! Lmaooo
"The anti-cancel culture crowd is downloading a browser extension so that they can press a 'dislike' button on a video sharing site?

Who said anything about adults?
Because they impact far more aspects of real life than just movie teasers.
"Racist people are less than worth their own weight. They make so much noise, but their opinions are worth less than anything"
My dislike is for the fact that it exists.
And plenty of the people who are upset over it ARE going to see it and either complain anyway or quietly enjoy it and never admit it because they don’t want to promote it.
"Voice can make a difference. It's like saying ""These people will never vote for my party, so why do anything about it?"" The people's voice is the changing tide."
"I was obsessed with Ariel and TLM as a whole as a kid. I don’t get the uproar, I really don’t. TLM was an adaptation of the HCA story - one that diverges pretty significantly in some spots (like the ending!), this is just another adaptation along the same lines but Ariel has darker skin. (I don’t even know if “Black” would be the right word for Ariel since I don’t know how races work in mermaids since they’re fictional creatures.)

My only gripe so far is also how drab it looks. That and I wish they’d stop making live-action adaptations/remakes on general."
"And in that realm, no one should have complained about ScarJo in Ghost in the Shell."
"Social media seems to drive people to define themselves by hills they’ll die on.

> Nobody: …

> JK Rowling: Let me tell you about trans people…"
I will never understand people getting mad at 'soulless live action remakes of beloved cartoons' when they are fine with soulless animated remakes of books.
I didn't care before but I should make time to go to the theater for it.
"it is. this isn't ""wokeness"" it's finally just leveling the playing field and giving anyone of any race a shot, they'll be shocked to know when they walk outside their white bubble that the rest of the world is extremely diverse."
"Which sucks, because the black elf dude in Rings of Power has one of the only storylines I’m vaguely interested in so far - the rest has been a bit boring, frankly - but if I say I don’t like Rings of Power people make… assumptions."
Whites (the ones offended) are feeling scared because other races are now equal to them.  Not above them but equal and they don't know how to act so they have to knock them back down to unequal
I would agree with you here. This isn’t like RoP or WoT casting.
">  The “anti-woke” crowd needs to chill.

This is the theme of the 2020s decade"
Barely concealing it.
White guilt too
Found the mermaphile!!!!!  I'd say find a net or a harpoon but they might be into it!
Half her body is though
Pixar’s LUCA did merfolk pretty decently.
"I care about it.

I'm a white guy.  My relationship with identity politics is that I usually try to ignore it. 

But this one really bothers me.

Did you see the video of the little girls who got really excited when they saw that Ariel looked like them?

Man, I felt that.  Let those girls be happy, and move on.  Don't even press the 'dislike' button on the video....no reason to make it an issue.

I care about this because I think it's usually wise for people to just let other people live, and do their thing.  Lots of kids will be really happy.  Just being represented somewhere feels good.  

And hey, if the movie flops, and doesn't make money...that's not an ""I told you so"", it's just a matter of Disney taking a risk, and let's see how it turns out.

If Disney takes a risk to make some little 6 year old girl happy, then more power to them."

"First, I think a musical draws in a different crowd. And second it isn't seen as a permanent the production version of the story.

That said, I don't think there would have been a big problem in 2000 with this. As others have said Life Size had a black lead Barbie (don't get into skin tone), a Cinderella live action had a black lead. Reddit will disagree, but it isn't about having a black lead/replacing a white character, it is about the cultural time. See comments here calling every dislike stemming from racism. Surely it isn't right, but it also surely isn't going to make people feel good about these changes when you are doing them to ""push an agenda"" instead of just doing them because ""they are the best actor/ress (not judging this casting).""

People think this is the way, but it will cause conflict as shown."
"That show was really good, she was a really talented singer. Took my wife to it in Deluth bc she is really into Broadway and expected to be bored but especially after the first intermission I was hooked"
I’ll add the woman can fucking sing. Anyone open to the idea she was the best candidate for the job?
"It's almost as if Disney should make original princess movies with POC characters. 

This is just pure laziness on Disney's part. They get to pretend they're doing something progressive when all they did was race-swap an existing character."
"I saw that!  The little girl was crying.  It was absolutely beautiful!  Yes, and all the haters can just go fuck themselves!"
"It was SO sweet it made me cry. And a huge majority of the women bitching about Ariel being black in this remake are complaining for the EXACT SAME REASON that video was precious.

The whiners are all saying, ""I had red hair growing up and Ariel was my first experience seeing someone who looked like me! That is why this makes me so upset and angry, they changed my beloved icon to be 'woke'. Bwaaaaaaaaaaaa!""

Never fucking realizing that they are wanting to deny the wonder of that representation to an entire new generation of girls. I hate these racist hypocrites, God damn, I really do."
"Disney don’t give a damn about the hate. The truth is people complaining about the live action movies, is people that never out grow their childhood fantasies. I’m never going to be more happy with the new movies than the ones I grew up loving but the little kids couldn’t care less about the old movies when they see the new ones (unless their parents teach them too) and Disney is making millions with them, that is why they keep doing them, so people can scream their hate all they want, nobody cares…"
"Yep.

The worst part is I feel so bad for the actress.  Probably getting a shit ton of racist hate which she doesn’t deserve one bit.

Hope she can stay strong and positive with things like your link."
You’re really making an “identify as” joke in 2022?

"But that doesn't even make sense! A mermaid with talons would likely be a deep-ocean dweller, while a hot pink one is more likely to live in the tropics. I'd say go with hot pink and white stripes and poisonous fin spines, and stick them in a tropical coral reef."
I was surprised with how Disney she sounded. I really liked her singing.
"No she isnt, her forehead and eyebrows are ugly af. Rather just have zendaya."
Growing up I only heard other white people talk shit about those with red hair BAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHA!

"When the Wiz came out, a lot of theaters wouldn't show it because it was a black production and they didn't want to upset their white patrons.

So this is...just par for the course."
"IMO, The Wiz was done specifically for us.

Granted, I was born in ‘84 so my pontification isn’t socially accurate, but considering the source of the discussion I don’t think tact is a hard requirement."
">No other people are so scared of being outnumbered 

And which other people (groups) are being outnumbered that you know this?"
Racism is never real until they feel threatened

"You don’t understand, this is an attempt to indoctrinate their kids. They’ll be perfectly comfortable around people of color, and that is unacceptable"
They need decency and kindness and empathy. MFs are chock full of undiluted hate.
"its fan baiting, they dont give a fuck about their actors all they see is money money money"
It's just irritating that black community and other minors don't get distinctive and original characters. They get rebranded with traditional Disney characters. As a white male in mid 30s I don't really have a dog in the race but it's so much more refreshing when you see representation from new characters and ideas.
I'm pretty sure nobody complained that a Chinese woman played Mulan.
"I think people are just racist morons unfortunately.

Who gives a fuck otherwise if Ariel is white, brown or black? I'm not sitting here as an adult upset because the cartoon I watched as a kid has a different coloured character. You'd only give a fuck if you're a racist piece of shit."

Do you think ppl who were mad about ScarJo playing in Ghost in the Shell was being unreasonable too?
The little mermaid is originally from Denmark lol
"Friend, the Little Mermaid is a Danish fairytale from 1837."
"You make more money pretending to be woke than trying to encourage other races to see the movie.

We agree about their only concern being money but we disagree about how they’re doing it."
"> I find it funny that white people have it so good that seeing a black mermaid is somehow the worst thing that's ever happened to some of us.

Who claimed that?"
Are you really so dumb to think people complaining about the race swapping means it’s the worst thing that’s ever happened to them? Lmao please get an education
"Chinese, japanese, korean, arabs and Indians are the biggest one complaining though."
"One of the threads I saw with a video of this had 68% upvotes last time I checked, which is the lowest I've seen in a while."
"I find it kind of crazy that a popular argument for many replies to you are ""well, they have Tiana from The Princess and the Frog"". As if having a single other example is totally fair and enough while every other princess usually white."
"I am not here for Disney's live remakes. Even linking Beyonce to Lion King didn't get me to watch. 

I watched the LM trailer yesterday to see what the hype was about and boy, Disney just sold a ticket. Halle killed that tiny clip of the song, I actually want to see this movie now."
It’s one of those things people never consider as part of systemic racism.  The lack of inclusion in society and entertainment.
"This is such a solid comment. I love how you framed how it makes these little black girls feel accepted and they can be a mermaid / princess. 

As many others have said: Who cares if a fairytale / made up mermaid is of another race or has a different skin tone? 

We live in a white world. Having POC in these roles allows us to make the world a better and more inclusive place, which makes for a better society IMO."
"I saw that thread, kids are bad actors though and you can tell when they’re being coached."
Yea weird how a bunch of grown men who wouldn’t give a crap about this movie care so much only because black. Sick of this gamergate shit.
You should post this on your fb and LinkedIn
"Yes! I’m so glad that this new Little Mermaid is a mermaid for the masses! I grew up having every rainbow of white actors playing all the roles and it wasn’t right or fair. Yes, I’m white and I’m saying it isn’t right or fair that we don’t have just as many POC in these roles since day 1! 

I know we have so far to go, but I can take delight in knowing that there is hope for the future and our younger generation has some beautiful role models. 

Please people, enjoy this movie and show everyone that skin color is no one’s choice and it’s actually our collective privilege to enjoy each other’s beautiful differences. 

PEACE!"
"So kids can't connect to an animated film if the characters don't look like them?  What bizarrely racist logic.  By that logic, a white kid couldn't enjoy Encanto, Mulan, Moana, Raya and the Last Dragon, The Princess and the Frog, Lilo and Stitch, Pocahontas, The Emperor's New Groove etc.  

It's an absurd line of thinking."
"They have Princess and the Frog, a new princess which makes sense. You don’t need to change something for the of change to cater to a minority group for the sake of profit"
Little girls should be taught to not care that much about skin colour.
Strange that black people happy/crying/delighted that a white character was made black is so wonderful we make compilations of reaction videos but white people disappointed with it should “die mad”.
"Whypipo really need everyone to be white: God, Adam and Eve, Jesus, Ariel.."
Cinderella and Jungle Book were fantastic!!
"We're not racist, but black people can't swim so it makes no sense. /S"
Live action Mulan made so mad!! They took away all of her grit and determination and made her have… basically magical powers. Who needs empowerment I guess.
"All of those had uproar.  Just because you didn't see it, doesn't mean it doesn't exist.  Particularly Lion King, that one was slammed by movie nerds online."
"You forgot Aladdin, arguably the worst of the bunch. And that's saying something, considering the quality of the others. 

It's just such an easy playbook to follow at this point. Grab existing popular IP, attach some big name actors, deliberately bait racists to stir up controversy online for free advertising, deliver sub-par product, and profit. And I mean *really* profit. The Lion King made over a billion dollars, despite having worse voice acting, worse singing, characters without facial expressions, and less interesting visuals than the original film. Technically, the  film is a marvel, and if it had to exist for Prehistoric Planet to get made, I'm totally okay with it, but it's a creatively devoid and soulless film. 

It would be nice if Disney used this live action remake trend to go back and make interesting changes or modernizations to films that either aged poorly (Peter Pan) or had potential but ultimately didn't come together (The Black Cauldron). But they just want to stick to basically shot for shot remakes that don't really capture the magic of the original and take the easy paycheque. I hope it bites them at some point."
Where have you been? Almost every live action Disney film has been received negatively by fans. Do 5 mins of research.
"Malificent and Alice in Wonderland were both good, though. Mulan was the only one I had any real complaints about, and that’s because they traded in Mulan’s sense of duty and determination for a deus ex machina."
I’m genuinely praying to see the argument to your point. It’s fair for people to say they don’t like remakes. but it’s clear of the one thing that sets this movie apart from the rest to recurve an unprecedented amount of hate
Would have been interesting to see what happened if they had cast Halle Bailey as Mulan.
The Jungle Book was received well by most accounts if I recall correctly
Wasnt that the first of the remakes?
They already have. Some people just have a plug-in that reveals the number.
"Mostly just a bunch of loud ones, yes.  Bots are more easily available these days, to just keep spamming unverifiable metrics like this."
It’s about one minute of footage showing the actress singing and some coral.  There’s nothing more to it.
Absolutely
Didn’t that film bomb?
lol i know... i hate this chick's name
I wasn’t expecting Hans Gruber to make a cameo but here we are.
The princess and the frog originally being based off a European fairytale I don’t think they would be upset about it. What surprises me is nobody complains about Disney’s gender and race swapped version as the frog turns into a prince not the princess Turns into a frog
This is the real question.
We had Moana and Encanto from Disney recently. Not live action.
"I know! It’s like, wait: I thought y’all said race doesn’t matter"
You want it to be exactly like the old one!? Just watch the old one
The only color they like is green
"Racists are, not people. Stop calling them that."
"White people, in general, still REALLY REALLY dislike black people (despite stealing everything about our culture, but that’s a different story for another day)."
Ariel is an established character though. I get she’s made up but what if they casted a black Mulan or black Legolas? It just doesn’t make sense and is so obviously trying to shoehorn diversity into a movie just to say it’s diverse.
White people are under assault bc of the woke lizard people pulling the strings
Thanks Obama
It's on Disney plus if you'd like to rewatch it
"Thats because you are a ,,normal,, thinking Person. Some people dont See black or yellow or white or green...they just See a human. So...good for you. Stay like that pls"
Yep.
I think more than 1/3 of the country is republican.
"She’s not an enslaved minority outsider. She’s just a daughter with overprotective/controlling parents.

Going by your logic. One should be surprised she’s played by a black person instead of an Asian lol."
how is she a minority?
LOL. Than why is it Black? What about us asian? Why are we always ignored?
"Yeah, that's the big red flag for me. I'm almost certain she has no musical theatre experience. I'm guessing this will be a Russel Crowe as Javert situation where a big name Hollywood actor cast mostly for name recognition has to limp through musical numbers they really can't sing."
Actors really should learn some humility sometimes and turn down a paycheck.
They turned down Lizzo for the role..
"The German Fairytale, The Frog Prince. Would disagree with you. It’s funny how you say you want original stories but your example isn’t even an original story that Disney created. They literally just retold the story, set it in New Orleans, made the princess black and had her turn into a frog."
"I saw Halle Bailey before she got cast as The Little Mermaid and thought that she looked like a mermaid, like kinda ethereal."
The director would say that even if it weren’t true though. Got no dog in this fight but just being objective here.
"Can we still dislike the obvious cash grab by Disney though? I'd really love an original story rather than yet another remake of a successful movie or story. I disliked basically all Disney live action movies so far, so I'm pretty sure I'll dislike this one too. I really like the animated Beauty and the Beast, Mulan and Alladin, but the live action remakes are just a lot worse."
Exactly what I said. I can’t wait to see Halle play this part. Her voice is beautiful and magical.
"Like the classics Blacula, Blackenstein and the inimitable Blunchblack of Blotre Blame."
Black Tarzan les go
I don’t care who plays the parts in a movie. All I care about is an entertaining and original story. Don’t remake stuff for quick cash.
Sounds like a good idea to me
But not asians. They only get to be martial artists or the nerdy computer geek.
">People are tired of effortless remakes that pander and exploit race (“Hey, let’s make a black version of the Little Mermaid. The black audience will love that shit), and further flame racial tensions when the movie turns into a flop (“They hated our idea. Let’s just blame it on race—not a shitty remake—and recoup our losses through public support).

This is something you've invented/taken from youtubers who make a living winding you up for ad revenue"
"Are you trolling right now? The Princess and the Frog was the “black version” if you will of the German Fairytale,  The Frog Prince. I feel like I’m in the Twilight Zone with some of y’all’s arguments"
Why would their very first audition be someone who looks nothing like Ariel unless race swapping her was already on their agenda?
In the original story it feels like she’s walking on daggers and she dissolves into sea foam by the end. These aren’t the same “Little Mermaid”.
Exactly why the prequels suck. Get a real fucking space ship.
"Yeah, I agree with you.

You instantly get called racist when you say you prefer adaptations to more closely follow source materials. I think it's way more fun and interesting to see how good someone can follow source material. 

And I think the same for every story. I wouldn't want a white person to play the role of a character that's black, and vice versa. Nor do I want a female character to be replaced with a male actor and vice versa.

But saying that causes people to explode."
Are you a little kid?
"Babe you’re welcome to write, direct, and fund your own adaptation if you’ll only be satisfied by a direct 1:1 carbon copy."
Racists
Holy shit the sanity and reason of this response.  Apparently millions aren’t capable of this type of empathy
Ffs thanks you so much. That is my feeling too. There is a problem there.
Kids like it. You have just grown into a bitter old man crying about the present not being identical to your past.
"Cinderella, Jungle Book, and Pete’s Dragon are commonly cited as better than the originals."
Tell them that there isn't a single white person in The Bible and watch their heads explode.
Yeah it is racist because this is about the trailer and no one has seen the actual movie.
can you share a link?  id love to see that.  it sounds pretty awesome really.
Yes. Halle reposted them on her Instagram and I genuinely teared up. I wish anything like this existed when I was young just to make young me feel pretty for once.
"Saw that compilation. It was sad. Those little girls being fed white people leftovers while being told it's gourmet. How do you think they're going to feel when they go to the store and there's no merch? Or they go to Disney and go to meet 'the real live Ariel' and it's the white one? Or just the fact they have to specify which one they're talking about? Disney could have given them an original movie with an original character. Hell, even a mermaid, it's not like Ariel is the only one in Atlantica. But no. They get Black Ariel for two hours before the movie gets forgotten about like the other remakes. But hey, at least Disney got to pat themselves on the back for being so progressive and if the movie under performs they got a built in excuse ready to go. We know who the real winner is here and it's not those little girls."
"lol

I wonder what they'll do with Sleeping Beauty..."
"Rachel Zegler (Snow White, 2024) was born in America but is of Colombian descent, yes."
"Well, to be fair, it would have been hard for *any* actress to sing underwater. Seems like CGI was necessary.

That being said, I get what you mean. People are shocked when I tell them we had a real live action Jungle Book in the 90s"
"I don’t actually think it’ll be that dark for the whole movie. I think it just is that way in this dark nighttime scene. The other promo pictures look much more vibrant, so, I guess we’ll see! I hope it gets brighter."
"Was Tom Hanks a lifetime martial artist like Wesley Snipes?

At least you could have gone with Steven Seagal the right-wing, anti-democracy, pro-Russian-fascist MAGA-idiot.

Cute attempt at a joke, but off base at *best*. 

Comedy is hard. 

Leave it to the professionals."
So it's okay when other ppl do it? LOL
"LOL. Chinese, korean, japanese, arab and indian websites comments are more racist."
Odd to assume that only America has access to YouTube. There’s racists all over the world and other countries have access to YouTube as well.
Now explain away Snow Brown.
Right?! People are making assumptions about the quality without the movie even being out yet. I can’t wait to see how it looks.
It’s not Disney’s job to do anything that matters in the real world.  They’re in the entertainment business.
Why… Heaven forbid there’s a white Ariel (that’s still available to watch) AND a black Ariel.  Kids just want to see a mermaid.  Her voice is perfect.
Just manipulative marketing
"Half the fanatical hate and fantastical love are corporate bots race baiting their product to build hype for an otherwise horrible product.  

Much like amazon ring and the ghostbuster reboot"
"But there is no debate.

The person who directed the movie can cast whoever they want lol. They can cast whomever they like and they did"
"Moana was a great movie!  I mean, I totally didn't tear up when she sang that song when she sets sail past the wave.  

Why don't they just make new stories."
"Yes, because everyone that disagrees with gender swapping characters is sexist and anyone that disagrees with racial swapping characters is racist, right? Cant be any other reason…right?"
Racists love to racist. Damn racists.
Imagine being so irrationally racist that you feel like you need to try and make a movie fail because a cast member isn't white...
Not here for Disney.  Here for my fellow citizens like Halle.
">Yeah she’s a mermaid, but she’s not portrayed black.

She is now though so maybe you're the one who needs to cope?"
"Hello, it looks like you've made a mistake.

It's supposed to be could've, should've, would've (short for could have, would have, should have), never could of, would of, should of.

Or you misspelled something, I ain't checking everything.

Beep boop - yes, I am a bot, don't botcriminate me."
He could have.
Because Disney likes money
Mixed race kids always get forgotten.
"Given that mermaids aren't real, shouldn't she be invisible?"
"Well I mean, Arial wasn't black sooo. 

Make a new Disney movie with the protagonist as black"
"I can understand. Looks kinda dumb. The CGI will be horrible. The wig is horrible. I like the actress. It doesn't even look like she is in the water. It looks like a screen blue screen reflecting off her face. 






















Let's be real, The little mermaid dies. Also mermaids were killers. They would lore and drag sailors down to their deaths. Honestly though, seems like most kids stories were dark. I'm pretty sure one was raped. 



















But can we have an original black princess with her own plot. Can we not make old princesses black for the sake of it? Please????????????? 























What about a black princess inspired by the little mermaid or that would be interesting. As a Black woman, this is what I want to see more about. I want more stories that are based on original ideas. What about black american stories or even African fairytales? 






















I think a lot of people like me, excluding the racists, don't want to see another remake. The Lion King and Mulan were both failures. I know that this one will be one to.  Some movies should be left alone. All animated movies should not be made live-action.






















We have a live-action Pinocchio ( like no one asked for that). We have one hundred renditions of Cinderella ( only one I accept is Ever After). We have a Beauty and the Beast. Aladdin. Lion King. Mulan. Disney just stop...please.























Okay....that's my rant on Disney."
"Adults will see it because they have nostalgia for the original, kids will see it because they're kids, its not that complicated"
"Strange Worlds comes out in 3 months.  You’re welcome, says Disney."
Don’t forget a President too
"If Hollywood is 90% white for decades and that starts to shift to 75% white instead, that's not a bad thing."
No one wanted scarjo in GitS ...NO ONE
Get back to me when they do a live action remake of Brave with a black actor. In the mean time try not to be so hysterical of a children’s movie. You’re fucking embarrassing to look at.
So I take it you were at the casting call when she auditioned?
1.5 million dislikes. 1.5 million people that can't get their dick hard unless they're foaming at the mouth angry.
"Agree 100%. Ariel’s skin color doesn’t matter AT ALL. I’ve seen people try to bring up Tiana or Mulan, when their race was important to their story and their narrative.

If you’re going to be more mad about changing casting, blame Ursula. The original was based off of a drag queen, but instead it’s an actress added for another big name."
"Of course it is... When casting was announced people immediately said ""I'll never watch it"" or ""HOW COULD ARIEL BE BLACK!?!""

Literally, the only reason people are angry is because they have a black ariel. I don't care. I just want good movie and this seems like it'll be good based off her voice. Everyone saying the trailer sucks are moronic. They showed absolutely nothing to justify that"
"Holy god, right?? Like I had no idea a fucking MERMAID had to have a specific skin tone being that it’s a MERMAID"
Solid analysis.
That is so hysterically accurate. Damn.
And they downvote this without any response
"Funny how black people don't have any compelling stories with originally black characters. Don't appropriate my White/European culture.

Or would you be fine with a White black panther?"
"Lets be totally honest here. No matter what anyone thinks of her skin tone, her face is *exactly* the same heart shape as Ariel. It's perfect casting."
"i do too at this point just to make insufferable trolls mad, i don’t care if she’s white or black but i love the tears of those who *want* to be oppressed"
Blacker?
What a dumb fucking comment.
Share a link please.  This looks like a flop.
"actually i think they revealed Johnny Storm is black in the next fantastic four, just like the previous one."
The Dutch are not mermaids.
LOL How is that possible when we have plenty of shows with black characters?
How is it clearly about diversity? Seems like they just picked her because she was the best one for the part.
That’s not what this is. It’s racist hate-brigading.
"You know why Disney are remaking everything though right?

It's so they can hang on to their money-spinning copyrights/IPs."
Then why were you watching the trailer? And clicking on it?
Disney’s Strange World releases in just a few months.  I’m assuming you’ll be first in line.
How many more do they have left at this point? Sleeping Beauty is one... I think I've missed quite a few over the years.
You still have Merida from Brave.
Princess Merida exists
Gonna blanket a strong 40ish% of the US?  Alright.
Cuz in real life mermaids don’t have eyebrows.
"Why does this question need to be brought up during this discussion. 

What do mermaids need eyebrows for? Who cares.

Yes, you're dumb."
Make sure you watch their brand new Strange Worlds in November!  They’re doing exactly what you want!
"Bots weren’t as readily available to enable a cluster of racists to spam the internet with clicks, I suspect that was the main difference."
Do you think ppl who play historical characters should reasonably match the race or ethnicity of the person they are portraying?
"Heck, if they keep the Caribbean vibe, they’re right there in that era with Creoles and Haiti and the **Danish** West Indies (Virgin Islands)….agreed, you’re absolutely right."
"Whose narrative has a problem with casting an excellent singer as Ariel, exactly?"
Just say the quiet part out loud. You think only white people can get the role of a humanoid fish
"Like how the little mermaid was original?  Oh wait, Disney stole all those fairytales.

Fyi, Tiana exists.  Black Disney princess."
Money by pandering what Disney considers diversity. I’m not saying that having the character be a different race is the problem. It’s that Disney does it in such a half-assed way with these remakes.
"Diversity hire, simple as that. You’d get the same  reaction if belle was cast with a black girl."
">Who cares if a character is black or white

>Ariel was white, why change it? 

Why not? As you say, who cares right?"
"Because representation matters. Little black girls didn’t get the opportunity to have an array of princesses that looked similar to them. The one black one created spent most of the time as a frog and ended up with a lazy, broke, freeloading prince. 

*You* may not care - but a lot of little black girls who see a beautiful, black woman with her natural hair on display, being vulnerable, innocent, rebellious and treasured (a well rounded character) - will care. It will mean the world to them. 

Especially since Halle herself is such an incredibly sweet, intelligent, good, funny, relatable young woman. With an amazing voice and acting skills who will do a great job, and not take anything away from the white original."
"There is no historic person in the story that can be branded as ""factually white"", and aside from that, if you retell stories, especially when your society is a cultural melting pot (USA), but just generally when cultural exchange happens and stories spread, people always have and always will adapt its contents to fit and represent their own.

To demonstrate this, take this a slightly different, but very related and very easy example

Why doesn't everybody in the movie speak danish, since it is a danish fairytale?"
"lol and he could be Mexican, after all... it's a nationality."
"I imagine people like you going out for a beer after work and I just start laughing and how pathetic it would be

“Hey Intrepid-Patience-93 you okay? 

“Nope! I’m pissed the fuck off! You see what they’ve gone and done now? They’ve made a mermaid black!! Like what is the world coming to when I can’t watch my white mermaid movies anymore!!!”"
"Casting a black actress should not be ""controversial."""
Why not?
Her voice is really good!
"
She’s neither black or white or any other humanoid/mammalian “race”. 

If you wanna get specific the grouping is Mythological and the sun-group is Water Spirit. Race has no meaning to this order."
Hate is what turned you ugly.
"People who care about skin color always start with, “I don’t care about skin color…”"
"What, specifically, about Ariel's story makes it crucial that she be white? Does she bond with Eric over a shared love of mayonnaise-slathered foods? Does she have to beat Ursula in a NASCAR race? Ooh, I know! It's the part where, after Triton blows up Eric's statue, she demands to speak to his manager!"
Agreed. They could have created a new princess and new story. This just seems so obviously pandering and changing an already established character just to try and tap a different audience.
"Bro she is literally just a good actress if her being black is a significant change to you even though her whiteness had literally nothing to do with the original plot, then you than you might just be racist lmao"
"Thanks for confirming it’s just a bunch of racists like you, despite how hard so many are trying to prove it’s not about race for them.  Just feeble, insecure, scared racists :)"
I want white Black Panther because black panther is fictional.
"That's the problem they can't take seeing a character they loved be black, apparently it takes away the sentiment lol this is the type of criticism we gotta love. This stuff shows the world no longer gives af what white people think, but they gotta deal with it."
"See the problem is not representation of minorities. Make films about/with minority characters all day long, fine by me. Black panther was awesome, new characters in existing franchises like Matthias in Frozen 2, all fine, but why do you need to change the main character of a movie like that?

Disney could create new characters, princesses, heroes in all forms, shapes and orientations and that should be fine. Racists are mad here, for sure, but a lot of non racist people are also mad, not because she is black, but they changed the main character.
If Black Panther was Chinese in the next movie people would freak out as well. I don’t get the outcry in lightyear because his parents never played a role in Toy Story and so it is of no ones concern that his parents are lesbian, but Arial is a story about a white girl with vibrant red hair and to have that role played by Halle is just a desperate marketing stunt to include a black actress.

Let here play Tiana if she is so good or create a new role for here where she can shine, but don’t change an existing franchise just to include here."
"The fans that wanted a faithful adaptation of the source material give a fuck. Which you don't seem to be. She may be a mermaid, but her character was established years ago, so everyone associates her with the original animation, which then sets up the expectation of having an actress that looks like that for the adaptation. Happens with any adaptation of any book or animated content. Not hard to understand, to be honest."
the only good comment in this thread

"""Everyone who is against forced diversity is a white supremacist."""
"Do you think real life historical figures should be racially accurate? 

Also, I agree about the hair. Maybe when she gets out of the water, her hair is bright."

Marginalised? Is that really the fucking word you wanna use?
And Ronald mccdonald but he's a clown and doesn't really count
"Mulan and her story is rooted in the fact of her Chinese culture and ethnicity. Ariel, being a mermaid, has none of that. You even make a point of acknowledging it. What about her race is really crucial to Ariel's story? (Or Legolas' story, for that matter?) Were you just as bothered when the Maleficent movie changed her skin color from green to white?"

I didn't know that all of Disney's classic princess lineup was massively hated.  Wild.

Disney is releasing Strange Worlds in just a few months!  Make sure you’re in line and put your money where your internet mouth is!
"It’s not a sequel.

But also, so many years later it’s going to be a different actress no matter who it is, so it would be a “continuity problem” no matter who the actress was, even if it was a sequential series."

So the double standard is what exactly?  That they’ve now got a black character in the starring role too?
"They do new characters all year long.  Turning Red earlier this year, Strange World in a few months."

"They’re not George Lucas editing the 1989 movie, don’t worry.  None of that will be changed or affected in any way by whatever they do in this movie."
It doesn’t make sense logically for someone that isn’t exposed regularly to UV radiation — whose ancestors would never have been exposed to UV radiation for prolonged periods of time — to have high levels of melanin in *skin* cells.
"That’s nice. But quite sad once you realise it’s not even an original Disney character with an original story. Instead, she has been replaced from a traditionally white character. “Black girls can’t be successful unless they replace someone” see what a horrible message it brings? I guarantee you if it wasn’t called the little mermaid and she wasn’t called Ariel, there would be way less backlash"

"Yes, people are fucking crazy, as evidenced by your comment."
Here's a thought.. maybe she just earned the role with her talent? Have you heard her sing? Stop making it about race when it's not
Stop obsessing over race she literally is just a good singer and actress and that's why she got the part

"Ah yes, comparing an actual historical figure, one whose life and story is firmly tied to her status as an indigenous person, to an imaginary fish-woman. Are you deficient in empathy, or just intelligence?"
Maybe they’ll try a black Mulan since the last live action flopped…
"I think you overestimate how much the average Joe gives a crap about this, the people moaning online about this will not be going to Disneyland for a family trip"
It only matters if the race is consequential to the part. That’s what people get upset about.
"It'll still be forgotten, but Disney will try to milk it for as long as they can."
"Did they even really advertise that? I saw it pop up on disney+ and from the get go, I thought it looked like shit."
Her dad is Javier Bardem and I think the mom is a black person.
"Ah yes, corporate trolling"
They have to fill those diversity quotas (and I’m not even joking)
I looked up what type of pigments fish have. I also had to look up if there i ethnically such thing as a Caucasian fish
"Considering the original story came from Denmark, and the 1989 film “The little mermaid” has a white mermaid called “Ariel”, we can assume that in the live action called “the little mermaid” with the lead character called “Ariel” she would also be white. 

Mermaids are fictional characters and so they can be of any race. But “Ariel” was created as a white character. And now it seems they are switching her race due to the sake of diversity. Rather than creating an original black mermaid character with a different name, they chose to create a live action based on their previous film they made with the race of the character being changed. 

You’d expect the same reaction if a black guy was cast as Gandalf or if Ryan gosling as the black panther."
There’s a chrome extension which shows you how many it got
"My understanding is that they’re cutting songs out for other songs from the musical, I think?"
"Because it’s safer and easier for Disney to keep pumping out these live action remakes.

They’d rather not risk creating an original live action black Disney princess because well, the audience isn’t really there for it"
Give it a few years.
Happy Cake Day!
It’s just really hard to be a racist and a fan of fantasy right now.
It's probably got more to do with changing something about the main character that is only being done for woke points.
Ppl were mad at ScarJo for not being Japanese in Ghost in the Shell.
Do you think real historical ppl should be played by ppl who can pass for their race or ethnicity?
"It’s always ‘big scary sounding numbers’ with literally zero context.

100 million view the trailer, 1.6 million ‘dislike it’ and that 1.5 percent becomes the story."
"Mermaid is a race IRL now?

I’m trying to find where y’all got this upset about white dudes playing Jesus but those a many, many, *many* comments must be hidden somewhere..."
Then do it. Let’s see it.
"Did they find someone from the Goa Kingdom (a fictional kingdom in One Piece) to play Luffy? How?

Did they find real actors from Agrabah (fictional city-state) to play roles in Aladdin?

I’m completely disappointed they didn’t find real merfolk from Atlantis to play characters in The Little Mermaid."
She was the best actress for the role. You would you prefer someone lesser as an actress and singer to fit your skin color preferences?
She was the best for the role. Her singing and acting was the best. Can you accept it that way.
"Yeah, instead they hired a human actress and put her in fishface... /s"
2 million racists had nothing else to do than spitefully downvote a movie trailer about mermaids. Priorities.
I'm all in for deliberately outraging racists.
You don't have to be too PC to see these people frothing at the mouth over the existence of black people are batshit insane
"Close...but before you trash the casting maybe double check and realize the actor is halle bailey and 22 years old, not halle berry"
"Ariel isn’t white and they are bitching about hair color. So dumb. Soooo, so dumb.(the whiners)"
It will be several million by time all the triggered right wingers get distracted by the next dumb thing.
Nearly half or more films out right now are original IPs.
So you lemmings can live underneath them?
"It's called ""Return Youtube Dislike"" for the chrome extension"
"Ah yes... The Return of the Dislike Button...

With a vengeance!"
"1.5 million, i guess that's technically ""thousands"" of dislikes. One thousand five hundred thousands."
"It’s not accurate, like at all

Only the owner of the channel can see the real dislike ratio"
The extension is incredibly inaccurate though
"While maybe not the root cause, based on the buzz its generated, what a miserable existence these people must have that something as simple as an actor's skin color can trigger them."
It just extrapolates with some data it has. I don’t think its the return of anything
It’s not accurate whatsoever
Isn’t that just an approximation?
"The extension doesn't actually have the data for dislikes from any video made after the api was changed. Instead it extrapolates dislikes based on the dislikes from its users, but the users who download a dislike button extension aren't exactly representative, so it's kind of a nonsense number."
How can it know how many dislikes the video has?
its not really real though. the dislikes there are from bitter losers who go through the effort of leaving dislikes in the first place
You know it’s not accurate whatsoever though.  Like way off when i tested it by more than 8x
Oh Christ yeah I just looked. With about 500k likes.  Seems like people might be hating it for something other than just another shit Disney remake.  Wonder what it could be?
It's also hilarious to see the paid Disney operatives spreading the propaganda video compilations of kids reactions to her color. They're desperately spinning it as anyone who complains is automatically a racist smh
That’s a shit ton of racists
Hilarious seeing these liberals trying to cope
"I got you guys

[link to the app.](https://www.returnyoutubedislike.com/)"
"12 million views, 12% dislikes, sounds like a blockbuster brewing"
One million people care that much?! God that's pathetic. She is a great choice for the role. She sounds amazing and looks mermaid-y to me.
The extension is only guessing. It doesn't have access to the raw data; only the channel owner does.
wow that’s a lot of racists
Headline should be “thousands of thousands of dislikes.”
oops all russians
Also it shows less dislikes than there actually is.
I was about to say they say thousands of dislikes but I say yesterday there was more then a million .
"1.5 million is ""thousands""? Well, technically yes.."
This is huge for me. I really miss the dislike percentage. Gave me a sense of what was worth watching. In some cases like these it’s bogus but in most it’s just helpful.
I was expecting a large number of dislikes but holy shit
"Swear half of the “outrage” is just marketing. I know there are idiot bigots a plenty, but sometimes I swear they play it up a bit just to drum up interest in their movie.  Likely, if anything like the other “live action remakes,” a very mediocre movie."
1.5 million racist Disney fans.
thousands isn't a good metric
Cannot believe ppl waste their time and life seeking useless shit like that
1.5 million angry racists
So 1.5 million racists
Why does YouTube allow the extension to work if they want to hide the dislikes? Cant they prevent this workaround?
"as someone who has access to internal stats for some big brand accounts, i can tell you this extension is absurdly inaccurate, like 10x-20x (ie a video with 1000 actual dislikes will show up as having 10 to 20k dislikes)"
Did they seriously just hide the dislike element?
">1.5 million dislikes

That's a lot.

Disney needs to add a ""trigger warning"" to all racists and people upset about people of color existing to the trailer's description immediately."
That's a lotta racists
That's a looooot of racists...
Which makes it 3x the likes ratio. The majority has very much spoken but can't comment without being called a racist
"Ah that’s a bit worse. Anything incredibly popular and even positively regarded will have a zillion views, a jillion likes, and at *least* ‘thousands’ of dislikes from sheer scale, even if 1% of the whole… but 1.5 million dislikes doesn’t bode well."
I guess all those people are simply racist /s
1.5 million people that cant get their dick hard unless they're angry.
That’s a lot of dislikes
"Yeah but the number they get isn't official. It's based off of ""extrapolated extension user behavior"". So it's taking the downvoting behavior of the extensions users and proportionaly expanding the number exponentialy"
I hear it’s not super accurate though.
That’s really weird that they just hid them from the UI but still made the information publicly accessible.
"Just means that the people who install the extension are biased as they are more likely to be the ones that dislike things and like to see the count.
So the numbers are suspect"
But it is only an estimation
"Wow that’s a lot. Too bad adults have to make a kid movie about them and bash the shit out of it. It seems almost every movie that comes out that’s different than the first is highly disliked… Milan, Pinocchio, lion king. I think somethings need to just be for kids and adults shouldn’t spend so much time judging"
1.7 million at the moment
That’s uh… more than thousands
Does this only work for people that have the extension? And you'd probably only have the extension because you want to see and use the dislike button. Sounds a little weighted.
1.7 million now. In 15 hours 200k people smashed that dislike button.
Oh my god thats a lot of racists...
"Last I heard of this extension, it just extrapolated using numbers visible before they were hidden and let users with the extension become part of that number.

I would imagine it is somewhat skewed since you wouldn't want to see the dislike counter without wanting to add to it yourself, but people are also being purist about a movie that came out before most of them existed."
"I was gonna say, it's more than a few thousand lol"
That’s a lot of racists :(
But YouTubers can choose whether or not it works on their videos
We’re you as adamant about the last air bender casting?  Or any other Asian character based movie that ended up with a non Asian character?
"On one side it's based on a fairy tale from Denmark, which was back then 200% white. On the other hand if it makes people happy then hell why not?"
"So, by your logic, the original isn't for black children.

lmao, woke racism is a trip."
"Nah fuck that, stupid change is stupid"
"Yes, the correct response."
"Especially when you see how HAPPY all these little girls are to see someone like them!  Melted my cold craggy heart, it did."
"Also to ""protect small creators"" even though they can see them in the analytics page still"
"But....but....I thought that YouTube removed the dislike button to ""protect the  small content creators on the platform."" I mean, that's what they said in the press release announcing the change."
Tom Cruise is going to be great as the new Black Panther
"It’s not even the ethnicity that people are annoyed about, I think it’s because it’s changing the very sacred memory we’ve all grown-up knowing like when someone mentions The Little Mermaid more often than none we’re going to automatically assume they mean the very vivid redhead with her majestic voice, we’re gonna remember how well-drawn she was and we’re gonna remember how it was a Disney classic from the days before they became a billion dollar empire of content.

I’m personally going to remember how Ursula looked genuinely evil but knowing how CGI looks these days where it really isn’t that convincing I wouldn’t be surprised if this rendition of Ursula looks frightening and jarring (in a really bad way)"
"Get the YT dislike extension.

Thanks for this update from 10 months ago
"I want to see a live action Disney film, any of them, where Danny Devito plays every part. Which one would be best?"
Those poor unfortunate souls.
"""So anyway, I start cursin"""
"I'm not even gonna lie, would have a higher probability of my watching it if that was the case. Either way I don't really watch the remakes Disney does, not because they are going in a different direction (which they are) but because I want to keep those memories of their older films and creations untouched."
But bolt ons to what parts?
I legitimately think that Danny Devito in drag would be some of the best casting possible since divine is dead
instant must watch..
I’d buy this movie sight unseen if this were accurate. Instant classic IMHO.
I didn't know I wanted this until I read your comment and now it is the only thing I want.
"Dear god, I want to see this."
I’ve never been more aroused
‘Can I offer you bolt ons in these trying times?’
Or adele
Do not get my hopes up like that.
Oh god... that picture...take it away....
"Ramsay bolt ons,  I hope."
I can live with that.

"I watched like a 2 hour long roast of the movie by the same guy who did a 5 hour long breakdown of why the Lion King couldn't possibly have ripped off Kimba the White Lion (which I also watched).

He thinks Be Prepared was shoved back in at the last minute since they had announced its removal to negative fan reaction."
"Its a money grab, but not some complicated thing with trademarks and copyright extension and stuff. They have existing IP that people loved as a child and they want to rope in a new generation while also trying to entice their parents to spend money on it too.  


And it works. Lion King grossed half a billion. As did Beauty and the Beast. Jungle Book and Aladdin over $350 million. As long as its not just truly awful Little Mermaid will almost surely be in that range too."
Want to commiserate with you and say how damn disappointing it was to sit in the theater for the live action movie as a grown ass adult feeling some sense of childlike excitement while anticipating an epic scene for “Be Prepared” and we got that crap. Lol. Sad times.
"At this point, Disney is looking to renew their IP by consistently remaking their original titles so as to stave off would be ""pilferers"" from ""stealing"" their stories.

Always treat companies with mistrust, always."
"That whole movie was a trainwreck, tbh. It was like 'the Beyonce show'..."
">It was as if Disney just needed a movie to renew the trademarks.

Please let's end the era of disney and fundamentally reform our busted ass IP laws."
"When Rafiki didn’t do Kung fu with his stick at the final battle, I was pissed!"
Damn I never ended up watching it. I was hoping it was good. Right when it came out I ended up getting tickets to see the play so I felt lion kinged out. The play was great though so sounds like I made the better choice between lion kings that year.
"All the remakes are soulless. I haven't even seen the trailer for this particular one and I already hate it, and it ain't for any casting reasons because I take no issue with that, I just take issue with the fact that it exists. These remakes are not only money grabs but they also take away a good chunk of what made the originals so appealing. The only worse stylistic change I can think of is the Ghibli movie Earwig and the Witch, which probably got Goro Miyazaki disowned"
"I grew up with the original. i saw it in theaters as a kid 3 times ans is my fondest memory as a child.

but from a story structure standpoint I think the redo was better. Scar's manipulation of the Hyenas was fucking ON POINT and really made him a better villain. Now instead of just being a lion who was already friends with scavengers he was an opportunist and intelligent manipulator.

However - YES I do agree they should have thrown the whole song in there. i know why they didn't - it threw the pacing off a bit, but I would have preferred a song even at the expense of slowing that part of the movie down."
"I thought you were joking, so I looked it up and.. you weren’t joking."
God damn it.
"Feels like self-sabotage a little; didn't Disney do that with Treasure Planet?

Why cast a fairly tame comedian as your main villain?

Do actors ever actually consider and turn down parts regardless of money just because they don't think they are the best choice for the role? Does that ever happen?"
"Oh COME ON! 
I don’t care about the race controversy (although if they were truly brave they would have made her Asian… just saying) but that hurts…"
But Melissa McCarthy isn't even purple! These color swaps are unacceptable!!!1!!
She’s not playing the (gender-swapped) crab?
Ursula should be played by Tituss Andromedon. Not Titus Burgess. Andromedon.
">Ursula's character design was heavily inspired by the drag queen Divine

[Picture](https://media.them.us/photos/5af44e5708d83800109eaa21/1:1/w_867,h_867,c_limit/GettyImages-86135088.jpg)"
That would be ideal but having seen Chicago I only ever pictured Queen Latifah in the role. Melissa McCarthy is going to butcher it so bad I can just tell.
"Ooh, also. Despite their age, Mason Alexander Park (recently played Desire in Sandman on Netflix) oooooooooozes the charisma needed to play Ursula. And they've got that non binary superhero energy."
"I think the issue might be that Ursula is a villain. Representation matters, but if they are going to put a drag performer in a children's movie it should be as a more positive character. Otherwise, it risks sending the message that drag queens are bad people."
"Oh man, that would be wonderful. People's heads would explode."
"> Latrice Royale

Damn that would be a great pick."
That would have actually been progressive so no
I want to see her played by Lizzo
"My husband said Jack Black. Honestly, I think Jack Black would kill it and play it totally straight with just the right amoung of camp."
If they're going to cast any drag queens as Ursula I'd go with Jinkx Monsoon. I don't think Latrice or Eureka has the acting chops for a movie like this.
Ginger Minj would be great too.
"can't do that to get it in Chinese theatres, that's Disney logic 101"
I think its Melissa McCarthy unfortunately
"As a trans person I think it was honestly the right call to not have a trans person play her.  There's only one thing worse than not having very many trans characters in movies, and it's having most of the trans characters that DO exist be villains or psychos."
"Eureka O'Hara could *never* carry this role. If we're racebending, swap Ursula for a sassy skinny bitch like Alyssa Edwards and let her just bullshit and sing for 2 hours"
She's being played by Melissa McCarthy
Drag Queen Ursula would be divine
IMDb says Ursula will be played by Melissa McCarthy.
Yo your right a drag queen would be a great fit in that role
They went with Melissa McCarthy. My disappointment is bottomless.
Its Bob the dragqueen for me or I'm out
Would love that.
We’ll it’s going to be Melissa McCarthy so…
Melissa mcarthy lol
I watched a local play where Ursula was played by my gf gay guy friend and he wore full drag and I swear it was one of the funniest performances I've seen. Dude killed it and last time i heard he was on tv doing something. I support a man playing Ursula all the way.
*Too* woke
Gurl Ginger Minj should have been Ursula. but McCarthy got chops I guess.
I love [Divine](https://youtu.be/wTOWIMJkKpc)! I definitely see the influence
Bruce Villanch in drag.
100% should have been [Ginger Minj](https://youtu.be/x2mqxIKd4Po)
Ginger minj used to perform poor unfortunate souls a while ago when people were pushing to get her the role for...some version i don't remember which
"My pick would be Alex Newell. They played Mo in Zoey's Infinite Playlist. Now I'm not one that usually enjoys musicals, but I was hooked on that show. Mo was far and wide my favorite character."
She auditioned but didn’t get it :(
"Lizzo isn’t really drag. She’s *drag* in the sense of her image, persona, style, and obviously her influence, which seems to contradict my first statement. But she isn’t camp drag. She is Lizzo! Her Ursula would also be…Lizzo. Which I’m totally interested in actually, Ursula stealing Ariel’s voice through her flute. Melissa M is amazing, but I’m almost more worried about that. So much CGI and showing up and doing scenes totally alone. 

No one will ever be satisfied. I thought Billy Porter as the Fairy Godmother was gonna be epic… and it was beyond embarrassing. Disney needs formulaic and sage, with an edge. That girl playing Ariel has an amazing voice so I’m not worried about her at all. Minus she can’t sing or talk through most of it. Im kinda high and forgot what I talking about. Lizzo should’ve been Ursula."
"Naw, she’s too nice and goofy. Can’t get that truly evil Ursula face."
Cast a Caucasian red head as Ursula.   Vote for Sierra Boggess....with wig.
"Yes. All coloured cast. Let's turn this into The Little Mermaid via The Wiz. 

####Fuck the racists."
"He does, he sings a reprise of Prince Ali."
"He does, he sings the reprise of Prince Ali"
She actually can. Very well.
"Melissa McCarthy is playing Ursula? lmao enjoy the movie folks, I ain't watching this shit"
Well she is transformed from a mermaid into a human at some point.  So the latter definitely has races. Would be hilarious if she became white for the human portions of the film.
"He had a reprise for Prince Ali. He didn't get a full song until the second movie. But his reprise was still really good, but they cut it and gave us jasmines weird song."
"Fuck I was like why are they mad she's black when they should be mad she's old? Ah well, better to be dumb than racist."
Man if they pull a Mulan and remove the songs and the fun side characters it'll just be more proof they use these movies as just a cash break. Make new movie keep licenses from going out of possession make as little effort as possible so the funds are high get brownie points for race swapping as if their headlining Black Princess (Tiana whose movie was amazing don't get it confused.)was a frog for 90% of the film.
Remember that chef.... yeah well lets just say sebastian is under the sea... 6 feet under the sea
it was a teaser… daveed diggs is cast as sebastian
"He got swapped too. In this version, he is a lobster."
You want them to show the whole movie in the teaser?
I remember watching the live action Cinderella and waiting for the mice to start singing. Was very disappointed.
"He's being voiced by Daveed Diggs, who is an absolute insane rapper, and the main reason I'll watch this movie."
"I'm looking forward to a guy in a foam suit with his face sticking out whispering ""Kiss de Girl!"""
Dude it’s a 1:28 min teaser trailer with one hint of the song. Why are people acting like everything is removed?
"Facts. Fuck palette swaps I want movies like Mulan, Coco, Moana, Soul, Princess and the Frog. I want original movies with culture and identity even if it’s not perfect it’s certainly better than this."
"I understand completely that Disney as a whole is some sketchy ass huge monopoly bs that has more skeletons in their closet than the Haunted Mansion.

But, there are entire groups with in Disney (obviously the majority being more on the creative side) that do in fact care about diversity, inclusiveness and cultural history. Some more than others and to different degrees. Took them almost 6 years to make Encanto. And one of biggest issues they faced was the pandemic preventing them from further research in South America. Though the biggest issues came from trying to convince Disney to approve a movie with an entire family as main characters. 

Disney and Pixar have really made a giant leap in terms of diversity and cultures. Compared to before that is. They still have a very long ways to go and it’s going to be a slow uphill battle. 

Especially when they’re pushing so hard for these bs “live” remakes that they’re hardly putting any effort into. But as you said, the ones at the top dgaf. They will ride on the nostalgic bandwagon for as long as they possibly can and to the point of live remaking every single movie they’re ever put out.  

Meanwhile there are a few teams that are doing great things at Disney and trying their hardest to come up with beautiful original stories that deserve to be told. Like Encanto, Soul, Moana, and Coco! 

They just take longer to make, get their budgets constantly cut, and then sometimes outshined and out marketed when Disney is shoving out 2 to 4 shitty live remakes every 12 months!"
They removed the songs to make it more realistic but then add that magic witch character. Ridiculous.
"I feel bad for your watch party. Live action Mulan was not just the worst live action remake so far, it was also one of the worst movies that I have ever seen."
"I cancelled Disney+ after watching Pinocchio on Sunday (and watching several disappointing Disney/Marvel films last month). This era reminds me a lot of their ""direct-to-video"" phase in the 90s."
"All of the Asians around me were making a huge deal about doing watch parties, making tons of noise on social media, and the next day it was like that movie didn't exist. Everybody has been getting excited about all of the Asian representation, but OOF that movie shit the bed."
"But see they got you and all your Asian friends to watch it. They totally baited you.  They are going to keep doing it until people don’t get baited with “I have to watch this because of x”.  20 years ago it was chick flicks and male empowerment movies.  Then it was clear teenage female thirst triangles. Now it’s specific racial bait.  Same shit, different day."
"They also know they'll have a legion of morons criticizing the movie for being ""woke"", and that can be used to have fans broadly put down any criticism at all - because only the extremes are allowed to be discussed on the internet. 

Sometimes it feels like for every non-white guy put in a leading role they cut corners somewhere else, since they know the diversity stamp will be enough to get the same number of butts in the seats either way. Other times I remember that Disney is just putting out increasingly bland stuff in a shallow attempt to appeal to an as broad audience as possible. Kinda feels like the days of mainline Disney making memorable projects might be over."
Can’t wait for the live action Snow White where Snow has 2 dads the dwarves are all LGBTQ
The album for this gonna win Grammys tho
You're kidding yourself if you think the boardroom and creative at Disney are not armed with political ideology.
Y’all got that Asian persuasion ;)
"Ugh the Mulan remake was absolutely soulless. They took a coming of age movie about a normal-ass but brave girl who uses her intelligence and training to solve a problem and turned it into “oooo look she’s special, she’s the chosen one”. LAME. Like that’s what made Mulan cool in the animated movie, she didn’t have special powers she was an underdog with a good heart!"
"Seriously. Is it that hard to come up with something new (Disney's version of new, anyway)? I feel like there are enough legends and myths and fairy tales to keep making ""new"" movies off of forever."
"Many filmmakers have done their version of the story.   For a really great and bizarre take, see [Ponyo](https://youtu.be/pfGDfDjAdSE).  

About as far from a Scandinavian fairy tale as you can get."
"I mean I was hoping the live action “remakes” would all follow in the same vein as Maleficent and add different takes or perspectives to the stories we “know” and love. 

Not saying THIS should be the plot, but I’m just suggesting a possibility in making the story “interesting” or different. 

What if through her journey, Ariel realizes Triton is actually a terrible tyrannical ruler and after a ton of conflict and resolution Ursula and Ariel actually team up to beat King Triton and have Ariel rule Atlantica, allowing merpeople to co-mingle with humans and freely travel in and out of the ocean or some shit. 

Imagine if Beauty and the Beast was turned on its head and the Beast actually is a POS and Belle falls in love with like a cabinet or something by the end who was the Beast’s son who was always super kind and generous (obvs need more backstory here). 

What if we did Aladdin from Jasmine’s perspective? Or better yet Genie’s? What if instead we followed Genie on his previous wish stint and see how his lamp ends up in Aladdin’s hands? And then the sequel was “Aladdin” but from Genie’s perspective? 

What if Snow White is actually from the dwarves’ perspective and is called “The Seven Dwarves”.

There are just so many possibilities to interesting live-action adaptations than just remaking an animated film you already made again in live action. 

If you’re going to do that, just remaster or remake the original 2D animation with 2022 tech."
This! I hated the idea before I saw the picture and realized anything was different about it.
"It's the same thing. Pretty much every aspect they change in the remake will be compared to the original: why did they change it? Wasn't how it was good enough? Why they changing stuff?

But if they change nothing, why remake?

And yet they insist in remaking because $."
Honestly I think it’s worse for diversity efforts if non-white characters are most often put in throw away cash grab movies. Put them in the good stuff.
"I think the majority of people who don't like it, don't like it because it is a lazy, cynical, low effort move to appeal to diversity. It's not that she's not white, it's that it takes no effort. Being white wasn't a part of Ariel's identity (that I know of), so her being black isn't a big deal. It's just that instead of putting in the effort to create an interesting, more diverse, new character, they just race swap an existing one. 

And now, when it bombs, because the rest of the film is lazy and trash (see: Mulan etc), they can just point to the criticsm as ""racism"". It's a common tactic nowadays."
I keep reading this sentiment but.. looking back at the little mermaid it's really not that amazing of a film anyways. Most Disney movies aren't pinnacle animation. Maybe for back when they were released but their are so many movies out now that are just so much better.
"I think that’s the problem, I don’t personally have an issue with her being black, but when that’s what takes the front seat to a faithful recreation of the movie it makes it worse. It’s worse because it (like all/ most of the recreations) haven’t been fully focused on recreating, it’s being righting past “wrongs” they made in the original movies that weren’t really issues in the first place. If Ariel was white, the “woke” crowd  would be mad she wasn’t black, if she’s black the “anti-woke” crowd is mad, but really it’s just that the movie will probably suck just like all the other new versions."
">	We are not the same.

But you will be perceived to be. Any criticism will automatically dismissed as racist/sexist/etc. We've been there so many times already."
I have high hopes that the song remixes will be good. Her voice is just amazing
"The Lion King Trailer had 45k dislikes, Mulan had 90k dislikes. The Little Mermaid has 1.5 Million dislikes. Someone is lying."
"I hate Disney cause they keep pulling this cheap ass tactic of “pretending inclusivity” for free publicity. Disney execs don’t give a shit abt inclusivity, they just pull the most “subtly outrageous” PR stunt, to get people talking about their new shitty film to get cheap publicity. Lets not count the people who go watch the movies just to “stick it to the whiners”. Notice how there’s always some controversy that sticks out like a sore thumb on recent Disney movies, if they didn’t carry all the controversy noise, all these cash-grab remakes would go under quietly and unnoticed like cheap cash-grabs would."
"I did not think that trailer was as low effort as everyone else did. Did anyone take a look around while they watched?? IT’S PERFECTLY ACCURATE OMGGG even the view when she looks up at the top of the cave is perfect!!
That’s what I’m excited about it. Also, please put Ariel’s bangs back please and thank you lol"
"Disney has rarely ever made creative originals. The little mermaid is an Americanized version (i.e. she gets the prince and doesn’t die unhappy) of the HC Andersen classic, and basically every famous Disney story is an adaption of classics to American sensitivities."
"I’m glad there are a lot of other opinions similar to this here. To put on my tinfoil hat for a second, it’s almost a perfect stir-up-controversy studio plan because (other than the obvious of it being talked about a ton)  if I say the movie looks bad, dislike it after watching or even had just hit the button on the trailer,  I’m grouped in in with wacko outrage nuts  and racists. 

It’s like when Elizabeth banks (IIRC) said people disliked and didn’t see the ghostbusters reboot because they hate women. Nah the movie was just a massive stinker, sorry!"
"I don't usually like race swaps because sometimes they don't make sense and feel cheaper than having an original character belonging to the minority/less represented group in question.

But Ariel is like, the most swappsble character in existence. She is from the sea, she doesn't belong tona particular human people of culture. Yes, the original tale is Danish, but in-universe the characters are meant to be otherworldly"
"I think hate is a strong word. From what I've seen people just heavily dislike it (obviously there's racists too but they're a minority on here or atleast i hope so) which is my take on this. 

The decision to make Ariel black was extremely stupid in my opinion but If the movie is *really* good (or atleast just as good as the og) then there's not much to complain about. Judging from other live action remakes though it's not looking well so obviously the skin colour chamge compounded with the movie *probably* being bad is going to get people to talk negatively about it."
You are getting nit picky remember this is the same company who called Lion King live action which I'm about 99% sure there was 0 living things in the movie.
"I wasn't a fan of the CGI beast's man face. I watched Belle (anime movie) and I really liked that so it's not impossible to just do a new interpretation of a movie the live action Disney ones are just their own movies again but worse. In my honest opinion they feel like if you've watched the movie when it came out and they have you remake it from memory most times. A few things change, but not enough to warrant watching it over the original animated version."
This is a good way of seeing it. It's always cashgrab this and soulless that but meanwhile there's literally hundreds of people working on these things and I'd argue most of them actually care and want to make something good and fun. I'll be looking for their influence.
I think it’s a team giving their best effort on a low-effort concept they were told to work on
But we’ve had fairytales with characters being played by people of color before. There’s the Cinderella movie Brandy did in 1997. Her prince was Asian. Her parents: father was white and mother black (played by Whoopi Goldberg). And the movie is beloved. I never once heard the word woke back then or any backlash at all. I don’t understand why it’s different now except it becoming more common
"Same for Rings of Power. It doesn't live up to the source material and for such a high budget, it has some embarrassing ass cgi. But they can call fans racist and sexist criticizing."
"[It's absolutely is ""diversity dollars"".](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xU1ffHa47YY)  This is what Disney does with its live-action remakes now.

In fact, this whole campaign of news articles about the ""race issue"" is marketing to them."
"WHY WHY does everyone think this is solely for the race card?

There’s an entire generation of women out there who grew up and saw this movie.

Now there will be an entire generation who will get to experience a similar story in the same “universe” but with a character who isn’t white.  It means more black parents and kids who can feel included.

It’s like no one understands part of the issue with systemic racism.  the lack of inclusion in society.  Doesn’t just mean college and loans and financing.  It means having hero’s your kids can relate to, can look up to, who look like them, or suffered the same shit as they may be currently going through.

Fuck so many people here are out of touch."
That’s pretty much Disney in a nutshell and always has been.
It’s Disney knows if they try to add diversity by making a movie based off of a story from a non European culture there is a risk that nobody will care. By swapping the race in a fairy tale from Northern Europe it at least makes sure they will get a bunch of media attention from making people mad and that will turn into views.
"Yeah pretty much most of the straight to DVD sequels were pretty shite. I did enjoy the lion King ones and the Lilo and Stitch one, but the good ones are usually an exception of the rule. All the live action movies are usually different, but in an awful way Mulan removed all the music which 100% honest?  There was not a single bad song and the fun of it got removed, Lion King became a pretty dull slog of a movie removing/minimzing Be Prepared the best song in it. The absolute only good live action one was Jungle Book i watched it twice it was fun."
"There’s a difference between those direct to DVD movies and these live action movies pushing for theater release as if it’s a brand new movie. 
  
I like watching them all for the nostalgia but I’d be lying if I thought any of the remakes were good."
I mean yes most people don't care for the straight to DVD sequels. The 2nd Little Mermaid was not the worst of them. But it wasn't good either (also it was just a copy of the first one plot wise but in reverse and sans prince).
"Thing is, you couldn't make Moana and have it be about a white girl (although 30-50 years ago, that's exactly what would have happened).  

With the Little Mermaid, her skin color has nothing to do with the storyline.  The original cartoon was a bastardization of H.C. Andersen's fairytale, it's not like it wasn't already taking a Danish fairytale and turning it into something mainstream western viewers found palatable in the 90s, so now Disney is doing the same thing.  H.C. Andersen's tale wasn't about a white mermaid swimming around in the Caribbean with her Jamaican crab buddy."
"Really trying hard to find something, I honestly couldn't care less I'm probably not even going to watch it I've watched Lion King live action and Jungle Book and Dumbo after those I've been done with anything they make live action. They could have had someone that looks identical to Ariel like a literal 1 to 1 hire and I still wouldn't care. I would rather they made something new I would genuinely be more interested in a movie touching on Ursula and Triton over just little mermaid again."
"You aren't being attacked for not liking it.  Hell, I probably won't like it.  I likely won't see it. But you might be called a racist if you say ""I haven't seen the film, she's black, she's supposed to be white, therefore I don't like it."""
"Pretty sure it was a d23 announcement too, but just a title card nothing substantial."
"The only reason I don't want them doing good is because I want them to have to branch out and try new things, hell I wouldn't mind if they intermingled with new movies occasionally. Pixar is the only thing pumping out original or mostly original films (shame Lightyear was boring)."
"Cruella was great, it's a prequel not a remake. Haven't watched the others cause I don't really want to, not new and and can only ruin them for me."
Black Spider-Man (Miles Morales) has been around for a while.
"https://movieweb.com/mufasa-the-lion-king-everything-we-know/

Yeah it was revealed during D23, but wasn't really talked about much just a title card."
They do that just to make you get a random bit DM about it cause they think it’s funny. Happened to me too
"It doesn't take much. I suspect the ""feature"" is used for trolling and gaslighting more than actually helping anyone."
They can get banned for abusing the Reddit report system including Reddit cares
"Same. I was like “what?”. Then I was like “ am I?”
Then I was like “no.”. That’s when I knew it was bogus."
First time on Reddit? Unfortunately people abuse that function when they don’t like hearing an opinion they don’t like…
It's a passive aggressive way for them to tell you to kill yourself without violating reddit rules.
That has gotten alot more common recently. Pretty annoying actually lol. I’m always like “wait a minute am I depressed. What did I write?” And then realize it’s just someone being a dick lol
Yeah I got reported for that the other day. What a bizarre thing to do
"Ah yes, the classic suicidal report problem, I've been reported as well. I'll probably be reported for this one too."
"I think its bots when you say the word as an auto trigger just in case.

if its wrong 10,000 times for every one its right, the cost of being wrong it nothing."
"If you contact the mods they can open a ticket with admins. The admins can see who sent you the suicide alert, and if they think it's malicious or see that user doing it a lot, they will perma ban them site wide."
Reddit really needs to start punishing people who abuse that feature.
Same here. It was around the time I was calling out assholes during the whole Roe v Wade thing.
“First time?”
"I've gotten reported as suicidal multiple times. I'm like probably, but I'm not actually gonna do it."
I personally think it’s not accounts - they report you and likely that’s the only option they can choose without getting flagged themselves
Reddit would do well to ban IPs from people who abuse that. I was reported 3 times for one post. It's ridiculous how easily it can be abused.
Always one of the funniest ways to troll. I always laugh when I get them.
I also got reported recently for being suicidal and have   No clue why. Weird
Don't mind them. People are pricks.
Isn’t that ridiculous?  That happened to me and really pissed me off - it should have made me leave Reddit!
"I got one a few months ago. Never knew what it was for, but uh, interesting that I made them so mad."
I got reported for that too. I don’t get what the point is? Like???
"Same, I was like wtf? All I said was something regarding cowardly gop tactics and fake outrage"
I got reported for being suicidal because I was aghast that anyone could divorce their spouse and dove their children in Stardew Valley.
"If you make a comment about suicide, don't be surprised if you get reported. Either by bots or simply because you're putting ideas in people's heads. I wonder if I'll be reported now."
They do this because it's against TOS to tell someone to kill themselves.
It helps racists feel like they did something about their inability to murder you. Poor stupid pathetic racists.
Happened to me before. No idea what a posted to trigger someone so much.
"Just got [one](https://ibb.co/p6D9TtM) a few hours ago after someone told me not to get so offended online and grow a spine.

Grow a spine like them, where they are so offended they go to people's profiles and click the option to send it lmao."
"I’m collecting suicide reports like infinity stones.  For some seemingly innocuous arguments, too."
Reddit perma bans from the entire web site for that and they're extremely aggressive with it. You have to report the help message though.
I had a spate of those reports. I'm not so I turned the function off.
"They want to hurt you, but the very thing that stops them getting the absolute shit beat out of them eventually, being on the internet, also stops them doing much.  


Everyone laughs about it, but at the end of the day it's a directed, intentional act of malice from a weakling scumbag who only wasn't violent because there was no way for them to use violence. If they had the power, they would harm you."
That's a weird way to report someone because you don't agree with comment.
Is that what that's about? I'll randomly get these suicide watch messages and was always confused.
Congrats!
I once got reported for being suicidal for stating that a mass child molester should die in a gruesome fashion.
You can now report those suicide hotline messages as harassment and Reddit will take some action
"First time?

Welcome to Reddit.

I am on the Fortnite sub and get reported all the time when I say something about the state of the game that people don't like."
I'm going to fucking kill myself.
I've had the same thing happen after arguing with a right wing nut. That should be a permanent ban.
"I did too. I hadn't even had a conversation with anyone or even had a reply. Just a bunch of no vote comments for weeks, about mundane shit. When I saw the suicide thingy I was so confused"
I get them often. Especially when calling out sexist and misogynistic men. They cant handle being told they’re wrong
You watched the trailer correct?? And you're not suicidal
"You can report the reporter, and they *should* have their account banned."
"I got that a couple times, but just laughed it off. Yeah I wanna die, but I aint giving anyone the satisfaction."
Yeah welcome to the club. Happened to me when I argued with someone in the conservative post that made it to popular....
How does being reported for being suicidal work? Like what is reddit going to do?
glad I'm not the only one that happened to lol
I got banned from an entire subreddit I’ve never posted on for being a “biological terrorist” like… Wha??  Lmfao
"I got reported like that last night, I have no idea why"
I hope you’re doing ok today
That happened to me too. I also have no idea which comment I made prompted someone to report me.
"Yeah they just do it when the want to tell you ""go die"". 

These are not the smartest people, be gentle with them"
yeah i'm really hoping it's just a fluke from the trailer! the colors in the trailer honestly felt very muted in general so perhaps it was just because it was supposed to be night time
I am a little worried they are going too hyper real like they did with the lion king. It'll be disappointing if it lacks the character and color of the original in the same way Favreau's Lion King did.
"Yup, my only issue with it is her hair, that should be everyone’s only issue. Nobody should be complaining about skin color"
Honest question - how can it look vibrant and still not look weird with her skin tone? Or maybe I just haven’t seen a black person with vibrant red hair?
"If sonic is any example, there’s still a lot of time to change hopefully"
Red doesn’t show up underwater.
"From the screenshots, I assumed it was bad makeup/bad color editing, which I still kinda stand by, but you’re totally right about the “environment” they were going for. It’s absolutely because it was supposed to be a *nighttime* scene."
"Yeah, the scene was totally dark in her grotto and I’m sure it will be more vibrant on land under the sun"
I was thinking it might be because it’s underwater… when you scuba dive red is one of the first colors to completely disappear and look murky brown underwater. It has to do with the way the light spectrum is filtered out the farther down you go.
I like the natural red hair! That crayola red shit didn’t even match her eyebrows!
I def don't like how every movie in the world (America) these days seems to be literally dark. Even the new Jursassic remakes vs the originals. Maybe to help cut costs of CGI but damn dude
Part of me thinks the darkness is intentional just to make all the CGI look a little better.
"Somebody mentioned it was supposed to be a night-time shot, which makes more sense if it's true."
"I mean, yeah.. it was the sunken ship stuff, which is a kinda dark scene, and also.. it's pretty dark under the sea! I thought it looked really good actually. Way more realistic, and maybe they're going for a little more realism. It spooked me too btw, deep dark water and the things in it is like my only phobia haha."
"That’s what I thought. The trailer gave me “this movie is going to suck” vibes, I wasn’t even minding the casting choice."
"If you look at the scene from ""Part of Your World"" in the original animation, the grotto she's in is dimly lit and not very colorful."
"I had a look after reading this comment. I absolutely love the way the underwater world looks (though I admit, I adore underwater settings so I am rather biased). But it definitely didn't look like a Disney film. I guess they tried to keep it more realistic and kind of overshot that mark, forgetting that Disney films are supposed to feel like they are full of life. Or it was a conscious decision of course, in which case it's a weird decision."
"It wasn't a trailer...it was a teaser. It's impossible to know the lighting situation in the entire movie from such a small snippet, no?  I highly doubt that if you really went to the bottom of the ocean that it would be bright and colorful with sun shining through.  But I can't be to sure as I have never been to the bottom of the ocean. Surely in the scenes that she gets her legs and is frolicking on the beach, the sun will be present lol but maybe I'm just too logical. I'd imagine that the live action version of a cartoon would look a little different. Right? I got a caricature drawing done of me and my family and I must say I looked different than I do in real life. 

Some of y'all are doing a lot of mental gymnastics to avoid the actual issue you have with this movie that you have certainly not seen in its entirety lol.  We saw a glimpse of two characters in this teaser which was Ariel and the ocean and you're miraculously able to form such strong opinions.  Maybe wait until you see some above ocean scenes, Ursula, Eric, Sebastian, Flounder, like literally any other scene than what was shown.  If I remember correctly, that particular moment is when Ariel is in her hidden cave playing with her human treasures.  So is it possible that her being in the gloom of the cave under the ocean might be dark? Like seriously....just say what the real issue is at this point lol. Stop dancing around your truth! 

The same conversation was had when they announced a Black/Puerto Rican boy as the new Spiderman...turned out to be an amazing film that meant a lot to a lot of brown and black children including my son (who is half white btw).  Representation matters.  Give it an actual chance."
"The original story, before Disney got ahold of it, was dark"
To be fair color is actually muted under water the deeper you go and the coral shots looked like they could be partially real but I wasn't really looking that hard.
My historically accurate mermaid lore only has them eat the flesh of sailors.
"My dude, there are grown-ass men on TikTok arguing that it’s scientifically impossible for mermaids to have dark skin because the sunlight doesn’t penetrate deep into the ocean. 

Let that sink in."
"Did they have the same issue with The Lighthouse?  I mean, who’s to say that’s an anatomically correct mermaid vagina?"
"Well, since their problem seems to be the “natural skin color” of mermaids i cant expect much better from them sadly :("
I wasn’t aware that manatees had hair at all
They are literally fantasy creatures lol
The guy has over 1k upvotes and tons of comments for whining about a mermaids hair color. Gotta love it!
"I mean I feel like it's pretty obvious that no one is talking about the ""natural' hair color of mermaids.

They're talking about the actual character of Ariel and her history as a character."
People see a tanned Japanese high school girl in anime and call her an African American. It's like their entertainment is being insufferable.
"You must not have been around for the fast zombie vs slow zombie flame wars...

Although I am willing to fight and die on the ""vampires don't sparkle in sunlight"" hill if necessary."
Yea these ain't even real. Mermaids ain't real y'all. They are not like Santa.
"I dont care about this movie, or the original animated one, but just because something contains some element of ""fantasy"" doesn't preclude people from complaining about changes to the source material."
"I mean, it’s kinda dumb, but it’s not about the hair of mermaids in general but the hair that one specific mermaid who’s trademark look is pretty much bright red hair"
"It's uncanny. Like a white person with dark skin, or a black person with blond hair"
"> i mean, seriously are people really going to discuss what is the natural hair color of .. mermaids??

It's racist code. Kinda like all the hoopla over The Rings of Power and how the black, female dwarves didn't have ""beards"" sent fanboys into a week of tirades about ""beards""."
"My issue with it is that it would seem someone decided she had to have red hair and the actress' natural color wasn't good enough. Unless the color of the character's hair is crucial to the story, leave it alone. Like if the character is supposed to have long hair (Repunzel), then yeah, she has to have long hair, but the color, it could be any color and the story would still work."
Yeah the original had Ariel in constant excruciating pain when she got legs and she never got the love of her life. Also the original she dies and becomes sea foam but we both know this isn't the story everyone wants to see. They want Disney's The Little Mermaid with fantasy bright red hair.
My mom's argument was that black people can't have red hair and that's why she was upset. So I asked her what race has natural fire engine red hair.
"It's not the same. Animators usually do the complete opposite of realism for it to look good (Looney Toons, for example! The exaggerate how characters move, walk, etc.)

Live-action, on the other hand, needs to have tons of realism (good CGI) unless you want to creep people"
"i know, my issue is that they went naturally shaded in the live action rather than vibrant and bright."
"That is one of  the problems with moving from cartoon to live action.   Cartoons can do all sorts of things that don't trigger a ""that is creepy"" response in the brain."
"Yes! Given how “realistic” they’re making the ocean scenes, I wonder if her hair will look redder when she comes up to the surface?! Would be a very cool detail. 

Speaking of her hair, I also dig how much it resembles surfer hair, with the partial dreadlocks and texture. I haven’t liked a single live action Disney remake except Cinderella, and The Little Mermaid was my crack when I was a kid. But I’m going to see this in theaters. It looks awesome from that clip."
yeah someone else mentioned that below as well and i didn't realize that! i don't live near the ocean and don't really engage in a lot of discussions or research related to it so that's good to know! hopefully once she goes on land it'll be brighter to account for that
"Be pretty cool if they used that. Like a reveal of her swimming up into view and the hair gains saturation until just pow, redhead Ariel."
Yes this is a very scientifically accurate movie portrayal of a mermaid…
"Dude, didnt you know. Black people can't have mermaid tails. No one can. (/s)."
The craziest thing for me is what makes her a black person other than the color of her skin? Even if black people never had red hair black mermaids might
Or people wanted to see an animated character they grew up loving brought to life and instead Disney is using the live adaption to stir the pot using racial controversy as that's the latest trend
"Is the fish tail red, though?"
I would be interested in what the most invested demographic - I assume 4 to 6 year olds - have to say after seeing it.
"I've seen black folks with red hair. Not something that really enters the brain. It just looks natural.

Until you get some of those Latino gingers. That engages the pity center of my brain tbh"
When I live in Africa I saw some people with red hair but at that time I assumed it was because of the serious form malnutrition. But now that I think of it I don't recall them having the other symptoms. But that was over a decade ago.
"I’m saying though. When it comes to skin tone and hair color, we probably have the most variations. I have two fraternal twin sisters, one of which is chocolate with dark brown hair and another who’s like walnut colored with natural brownish blonde hair."
"Wait, what?

Did not realise that at all. (Malcolm X having red hair)."
"The author of the original story doesn't say what her hair color is and she doesn't even have a name. So Disney makes up a bunch of details for the first movie and people are fine with it. Then, Disney makes up some more details and now all of a sudden it's bullshit."
People just want to be outraged about something
Thanks. You saved me the time of having to type
Feel like those people got bored with “black elves don’t exist in LOTR” and re-boarded the Hate Train only to stop at The Little Mermaid.
"Gotta remember these are the same people who think they can see chromosomes, dna or bone structures like mega Superman or someshit.

They simply aren't living in this reality anymore. That's all it is. there's no logic behind it, it's so disconnected from reality it's actual insanity at this point."
"Whales, sea lions, dolphins, orcas, walruses. None of these are pale skinned outside of a couple outliers like belugas or Amazon river dolphin."
"Because the character is literally iconic?

Imagine taking ANY iconic black character and white washing them today."
"Funny, I know  alot of women that dont like the casting decision."
"I don't care much, but my wife just wishes she had red hair. Totally cool with the race aspect. So I guess it's not just grown men."
"Why couldn't she be the other kind of mermaid, with the fish part on top, and the lady part on the bottom?"
"People are upset that a character they know has been changed. Idk why people act shocked when this happens. It's not about whether a mermaid can be X Y or Z. It's that Ariel, to a lot of people, is already a character who is recognisable.

Personally idgaf about that character or this movie. I was already an adult when the Disney film came out. But I can understand why people do."
Just because someone doesn't like does not mean they are racist.
Malcolm X.   IIRC at one point in his life his nickname was “Red.”
">People need to stop being such dicks!

I've got some bad news for you."
"I think it's just the easiest way to block someone. They want to report without having a good reason so they use that one instead, likely because people complain often."
Because it’s a huge part of Ariel we all recognize her by the fire truck red hair.
"I mean it’s obvious that the problem is her tail is an inaccurate accurate color. That tail looks nothing like the color of Ariel‘s tail, and it has way too many fins. Why aren’t they complaining about that?"
"She's not even the only Disney princess with red hair. Merida, Ariel, and Anna have red hair. And expanding just slightly Jesse from toy story, Mrs Incredible, Jessica rabbit, misty from pokemon, Jessie from pokemon, etc. 

But also... the Ariel cartoon you know and love... still exists."
It would be really neat if she ended up having the bright red hair above ground.
That would be true for the cartoon too though.
"there is nothing biologically based on reality about mermaids. I don't see a point in saying which colors are unrealistic, it's all unrealistic"
Yup! And if you look at the movie poster it looks way brighter when she’s out of the water.
"Red is black at depth.   Blacker than black, apparently.  Hence the reds in some deep critters."
"This is where I thought they were going with this in the trailer. 

Underwater everything will be muted and we'll see her in her full color in the  
Part of Your World rock with waves crashing on it scene. I can see them even having her save the prince and interact with him on the beach at night instead of night/day so they delay showing her full colors until that song so it's an even more emotional/powerful moment."
"reddit has a bot that basically sends support resources for people thinking about suicide, but assholes misuse the feature by reporting people as suicidal simply because they disagree with them or dislike what they said"
"On the automated mail, there is a button to report people who abuse it."
Albinos?
i actually really liked her singing but i can understand where you're coming from
"It isn’t, they’re just trying to cover their racism."
"she looks awesome, my only criticism is they missed an opportunity to have her had woven stuff she found (human artifacts or shell beads or any number of things that would have looked cool) into her hair"
"lol amen i am a ginger supporter, as a woman dating a red head man"
Guess what color isn’t visible deep in the ocean?
i understand your concern with that. i say it as someone who loves bright red hair (and is planning on dyeing theirs bright red lol) so i'm probably a bit biased. she has a lovely voice though and i love the way they made her tail and i am looking forward to seeing what the final film looks like
Yep! Malcolm X had naturally red hair when he was younger.

Hook was perfect. It’s still one of my fave movies of all time. Disney needs to do more adaptations like that.
Probably IP expiration
Hook is a damn masterpiece.
"Even if they didn’t make bank, they keep disneys properties from going public domain, which is all they are there for.  Modern day equivalent of that fantastic four movie"
"As someone who spent 4 years managing a movie theater, many parents will shove their young kids into any movie they deem “for kids” and run off to have two hours of peace and quiet lol"
"Hook isn't a Disney movie, though."
"Kids are most certainly not the target audience, just like they weren't for all the other live action remakes."
Copyright last for like 75 years and Disney is the main proponent and lobbyist that is trying to extend their stranglehold on IP even more. This is about $$$.
"It doesn't work like that.  For example, Winnie the Pooh is now public domain, as of last year (95 years since his original publication), but only the Winnie the Pooh and characters as exhibited in the 1926 books.  The newer stuff doesn't reset or claim anything, but just creates additional copyright dates for those changes.  

Similarly, unless there are legal changes (possible, because Disney is the biggest driver of copyright extension laws, due to this), Mickey Mouse will be public domain in 2024, but only as he appeared on Steamboat Willie.  Though in a complex addition to this, they may be able to make a trademark claim on that, due to their use of that version of Mickey in modern branding, and trademark doesn't have an expiration date (which may be what you're thinking of, but this doesn't require a movie or other art work, just its use as a trademark."
I think this is a long way of saying don't call me racist for not wanting a black Ariel lol.
"Sadly, I doubt Disney cares about them. If they cared they'd just make an original character instead of rehashing remakes. This is clearly a cash grab and they knew there would be backlash. People will hate watch and people will support watch it. Win win."
I'm miffed the mermen don't l look like these [guys.](https://slate.com/human-interest/2020/01/merby-merman-calendar-history-masculinity.html)
"Jokes aside, Ariel has had a well established image for decades. Disney knew it would blow up on social media, this decision was 100% part of their marketing plan."
This is colonization lol
That is exactly what the scene is in the [animation.](https://youtu.be/SXKlJuO07eM)
I dislike all disney live action adaptations equally
"Bingo.

The people who have legitimate gripes with maybe the direction of the movie aren’t going out and downloading an extension to dislike it.

They aren’t taking the trailer and remaking it with a white mermaid and trying to pass it off as not racist.

The deeper bowels of this thread are honestly sickening.  

I’m all for constructive criticism like lighting or the cgi quality - but literally none of the loud complainers have anything of substance to say.  Aka closet racists."
"There's still a good portion of the internet which is very reactionary to diverse casting and sees any race changes from previously white characters as forced diversity, unfortunately"
"Lmao racism, i am almost as dark as halle baley and i am european so there is no b/w culture war over here - its obvious that disney is doing this to bait - all in all this increases profits, the outrage is PR too - and in china f.e. they dont do this shit, they just pretend to be woke in the west"
It's not racism.
"How would people react if they do a live action of a movie where the lead is already a POC and cast someone white to play them?

Would all the people screaming about it also be racist or would the people complaining about the people complaining about Ariel be hypocrites?"
Everyone is racist but me -  ^ this guy
"I disagree with the last sentence.  
Sure, for a lot of people changing the race of Ariel will be the reason to press that dislike button, but Disney specifically is getting a ton of hate (And a lot of it well deserved, I say) for various other things.  

And if disliking the choice of what Ariel's hair looks like is legitimate criticism, does disliking that the new one has different skin colour have to be only comming from racism?  
(It is. but technically it doesn't have to be and I can pretend that all those haters are just disliking the visual differences for their own artistic preferences of the previous work)"
That's a miserable assumptions to make
"I’m not sure why it’s that weird, these films are already very disliked and they added another layer on top of it of swapping the race of the character, which I don’t care about but plenty of people freak the fuck out when a white person plays anything that should be another race. 

ie. I don’t think a significant amount of people care that she is black, they care that her race was swapped at all.

If they wanted a black main character, they should have just made a live action princess and the frog, that would actually be doper because they could the original voice actor for the bad guy to play him."
"Please explain why people were upset over Scarlett Johansson being cast in Ghost in the Shell

Edit: that's what I thought"
Really? Cause we've been burned before THREE times now. I think the hatred is well earned. Your seriously defending Disney and it's capitalism ways?
"You think there wasn't racist thinking on Disney's part? The change is calculated. The question is whether or not the change matters in the scheme of things -- the US is not the whole market, and the rest of the world is becoming richer. If Disney truly wanted to be altruistic, they would have made the Little Mermaid noticeably Native American, the most underrepresented and oppressed group in the United States by far."
">people like you (and other causal viewers) may dislike the concept, but you’re probably not going to go out of your way to dislike the video.

I disagree. I hit dislike or like on stuff all the time. It's also usually that I'm more inclined towards hitting dislike on something I dislike than hitting like on something I liked. I think what you push here is a line they want you to buy into that a lot of corporations have been pushing to try and brush off any criticism from fan communities for their shitty products. 

And I'm real serious about this. Pay attention to where these stories of ""racist fans react to black casting"". Because I'll tell you this I either don't see them or see them far far less when the actual show is good. Right now in front of all of our faces is the truth of this situation. House of the Dragon has quite a few prominent roles cast to black actors but that has received nothing but praise from fans. Meanwhile Ring of Power has done the same thing, and the only fucking story you hear from that is ""racist fans review bomb RoP!"" Maybe some of that is racially motivated, this *is* the internet and you have to acknowledge that that shit will be there, but when it's something like that or something like this video where it got 1.5 million dislikes, then maybe, just maybe it's something more than that. And paying outlets to push stories about it being racist fans is just a vain attempt to try to get some backing for their product do to meta aspects."
"They just voiced their dislike of the movie preview, why wouldn’t they click the dislike button lol? I think if you were young enough to see and like the first movie, the remake movie is an easy thing to hate. Same with the lion king and all their other remake garbage. Then their attempt to win a social brownie with all their race games is just pathetic."
"I don't like any of the live action adaptations, but I will say it feels like there's a double standard with this film with people saying nobody should care about the color of Ariel's skin. The Little Mermaid is a Dutch fairytale. Can you imagine how much outcry there would be if a movie studio took a non-white story and made the main character white? Or if Disney remade Mulan, Aladdin, or Princess and the Frog with a white protagonist? I feel like there would be a lot of overlap between the people making fun of others for being upset over The Little Mermaid and people who would be upset about whitewashing.

I don't really feel like diving into getting butthurt over whitewashing, blackwashing, or any other kind of washing. What I will say is I wish Disney would just drop the remakes and make more *original* films with protagonists of any race their hearts desire.

But Disney is a corporation that just cares about money, and these remakes are basically guaranteed box office successes. So it won't stop any time soon."
"I just struggle to see this as anything other than pandering or going for the controversy just for views. Ariel is a pretty well established character. Sure, mermaids aren't real, they can be whatever color and all that, but Ariel is a ditzy ass pasty redhead. I guess we can race/gender/sexuality/etc swap any fictional character, it just feels like lazy pandering. I really hope the writers are better than recent live action adaptations, otherwise this is just a cash grab."
"For starters, and full disclosure, I'm white. Now, to play devil's advocate....

I dislike it because there is no need to remake all of these things, period. The fact they'll remake things and then change genders, race, etc. just comes across as shameless PR, digging for goodwill. I liken it to coffee places that have a seperate receptacle for their cups and 'litter'. It all ends up in the same place, but it gives the appearance of them doing good. If these studios were sincere, they would be producing original content featuring these minority characters. I'm sure there's no shortage of people writing these stories."
"Do you actually know it got more dislikes? According to the title, the other movie trailers could also have thousands of dislikes, but this one was _viewed_ more than any other."
"Not the person you asked but I think the early 2000s Disney movies could work. Treasure Planet and Atlantis for example. At their core they are kid friendly action adventure movies and there's plenty of live action movies like that. Also Lilo and Stitch I think could work. The family stuff, which I'd say is the heart of the movie, didn't need to be animated and Stitch could work as a CG character."
Under the Sea is the only part of the movie most of these people remember
"The trailer was all about mystery and darkness. The lights flashing above her were clearly a ship battle happening in the darkness. There wasn’t much showcasing of color, but even her tail in that darkness was a good hint of how well they’re going to do the colors."
"These live action Disney remakes have been the same boring, dimly-lit and unimaginative/unnecessary projects for a decade. They’re worth critiquing at this point."
"> I’m hoping it’s actually going to be brighter. 

Hahahahahaha. Ha. No. This is a *Disney* Live Action Remake we're talking about. Unlike with *Sonic the Hedgehog*, Disney is too proud to admit they made any visual mistakes that should be fixed before release. You remember the Lion King remake, right? Bland colors, little contrast, practically no facial expressions - you could barely even tell the lions apart."
"I just assumed she was In her treasure cave, it's pretty dark in there. Hopefully!"
"The voice is actually the one thing I disliked. Well not necessarily the voice but the drawn out ""beeEeeEEee."" I think the original is a lot better by being simpler"
Look at the YouTube comments if you want to be disappointed
"Somehow I doubt the trailer is getting thousands of dislikes because the movie doesn’t look bright enough.

It’s almost like there’s another factor that people are getting unreasonably angry about, but I can’t quite put my finger on it…"
We surely know thats not the case
I am quite sure that calling 150 million people racist is over generalization to the extreme.
"I'm pretty sure there are reasons beyond black=bad for those dislikes.  Bit of a jump to call them all racist.  
Some?  No doubt.  But not all."
"You are racist

Opinion disqualified

Ez"
I am assuming the person who wrote the article and the people commenting about it?
"1.4 million people, as it sounds.."
It’s certainly not the first time guys in their 20s to 40s decided they were welcome in media made for little girls.
">Most coral reefs are closer to the equator and tropical areas.

>What were they expecting? Florida keys mermaid?

I want mariana trench mermaids, deathly pale white from the ocean depths with nasty parasites coming out her eyes and no hair."
The OG little mermaid was in Denmark so probably a white mermaid but at the same time mermaids aren’t real so who cares. Not sure why I’m even commenting TBH.
"Hold on now, if you're gonna use real world logic, living next to the equator is not what gives you dark skin.  Living with high amounts of sun exposure does.

On the surface, living near the equator means getting more sun.

Only problem is that the little mermaid lives under the ocean where there probably way less sun exposure.

Therefore by your own logic the little mermaid would probably not be black.

My bet is that since shes a mermaid she would be either blue or grey like sharks"
You know mermaids aren’t real right?
"Wait, so realism matters now?"
Red head. Maybe Irish?
"Little mermaid is supposed to be set by Denmark I believe. However, I agree that people are being stupid."
">Most coral reefs are closer to the equator and tropical areas.

I don't think fish deep in the ocean are getting a whole lot of sunlight to darken their skin. If anything, it would push them towards being pale."
"Mate, people have darker skin color because they've always lived under the scorching sun of the equator and their melanin evolved to protect them from the sunrays.

Mermaids live under the sea. You know what blocks sunrays? Water. By all means the mermaid would be the whitest girl alive assuming mermaid evolution operated under the same logic as human's."
"I mean if you want to play that game, Mermaids are aquatic and live deep under the sea. Just living in slightly less bright and cooler climates humans evolved white skin. Imagine little sun they would get down in Atlantis or wherever they are living. Black skin would be illogical.

Let's not try to use arguments like biology to describe mermaids..."
I mean we’re talking about the same people who think Jesus was white. I always like to ask them why the Bible never mentions his sunburn.
"I dare say that people who do care (I do acknowledge that a lot of the hate is from racism) care about the new Ariel not resembling the cartoon Ariel whom they may hold very dear.  
I think if the movie manages to evoke the same feelings that the cartoon did, those people will be okay.  

I worry more that the movie will suck and so those people will keep disliking the new Ariel movie (and the character) and the decision to make Ariel black will bring more division than union."
Bleach blonde and drunk?
"Oof, don’t use their points about “geographical accuracy” against them, they’re gonna be pissed"
It’s like they’re programmed for racism on any level. Lol so weird
"Yah you’re right.  I always liked to think the racists and morons were just louder than the rest, but it’s so prevelant still. It’s crazy and disgusting.  I watched a video showing how happy and excited black kids were to see she was black mermaid. I keep pasting that link whenever I see these racist cows post a dumb comment."
Don’t forget about Kenobi
"The criticisms of Rings of Power are pretty spot on. They really did just ignore a lot of the established lore. If you don't care about that then great, but there are plenty of people who do. They might as well have just made an original fantasy world. People can dislike a show without being racist."
"But that’s not even true…the racists are the minority. I’ll tell you 100% I’m not racist, but sacrificing lore and storytelling for a random black elf or dwarf is just corporate pandering. In rings of power for example, they could have just made all the Harfoots black. That would have been great and it makes way more sense. Instead a tribe that is extremely anti-social and not trusting of outsiders has five different skin tones? It makes no sense. 

But because of this critique people are racist. It’s so fucking dumb."
">	in this country

r/USdefaultism"
"Don’t forget the House of Dragons cast hate too.

In fact the only even halfway legitimate criticism like this lately has been them trying to tease a female Dragon Reborn in WoT. That was just asinine writing regardless of the reason."
"Step 1: take popular IP with white people

Step 2: remake with half the cast being black/token minority of the day

Step 3: overreact to criticism as bigotry to rile up idiots on the internet (such as u/SpaceCadetriment). ""We stand behind xxxx because we totally care about pop culture politics and totally not money.""

Step 4: enjoy full censorship of all criticism of your objectively terrible and unoriginal show, as well as advertisement from the stupids that need to virtue signal or just be mad about something on the internet."
What would you say if Mulan or Moana was played by a white person in a live action remake?
"> Between this and the Rings of Power idiocy it is truly sad to see just how alive and well racism is in this country.

Why is racism not an issue for House of the Dragon? Why am I not seeing stories being promoted about how all the fans of that show are racist too? That show took an all white fantasy cast and put black actors into some of its most prominent roles. Why isn't a narrative being pushed about racism towards that shows low reception? Oh wait, it doesn't have a low reception, it is actually a good show. So even what fans would judge it purely on the race of the actors aren't really relevant because all the ones who aren't racist outweigh them. GoT and LotR probably have a lot of overlap when it comes to fandom honestly. So where are all those racist fans review bombing that show? 

It's because this only happens with shitty shows or movies. It's a way for corporations to deflect and hopefully secure some support just from people ""fighting racism"". Same thing happened with Sandman. It has a very prominent black cast and it was well reviewed by fans regardless of that and despite some racists even complaining about it before hand. 

So yeah maybe all this needs to be re-examined a bit instead of just buying into the line that corporations are trying to feed us. All this is doing is preventing any honest discussion about any of this stuff."
Representation matters. When you race swap you dehumanize them.
"This, very much this."
Why?
"Really giving ""Black=woke"" vibes from this post."
"Because they cast an actor who looks like that, it doesn’t need a deep plot reason. Why was the last James Bond blond?"
How does it hurt the story? How does it affect the story in any significant manner?
The actress earned the role through her audition and talent?
"Considering they went with a white person first, and only cast this lady when the first choice backed out it seems like they just picked whoever was the best singer and actress."
Counter point… who gives a fuck. It’s a mermaid movie.
"Listen, if this is what you spend your time on, you need to take a step back and reevaluate your life."
What’s political about the skin color of a mythical creature?
This is such a lazy argument.
No. It doesn’t.  One side doesn’t give a shit. The other side writes essays about why she shouldn’t be black lol.
"There’s a handful here, replying to this comment, who think they’re making smart points but it’s coming from a racist place. And it’s hilarious and cringey."
"The actual children like them and the merchandise, toys, etc."
Disney should just leave the film industry period lol
"My children prefer every live action remake to their animated original. The movies aren't bad, you're just not the viewer they think about when making them."
"The visual update to The Lion King was pretty cool, but I'm still baffled that it was somehow a longer movie that also skipped over parts of the source material."
"The Jungle Book wasn't bad

And 101 Dalmatians way back in the 90s also at least was smart enough to deviate a little bit from the source material."
You didn’t like the Will Smith genie?
"Exactly right! It would still have dislikes/negative comments, no matter who the actor was. So we can say for sure they aren't all related to that."
And you’re assuming racism is the thing making up the gap in attention this is getting?
"I didn’t say the loudest ones aren’t racist, I just some hate reboots"
"So I am, but I just don't watch them. I don't see any reason why I would go to the length of watching the trailer and disliking it. 

Except, of course, that other reason."
You doubt the groans of everyone waiting for the next live action movie instead of something new
"Never forget how dirty they did Admiral Ackbar to prop up a random purple haired white lady with no history in the fandom.   

That one example wholly explains how Disney operates, and Little Mermaid isn’t any different."
The character isn’t even human. Race is a social construct invented by humans. It isn’t racist to change the skin pigment of an **imaginary non-human**.
"It's one of the reasons why Ke Huy Quan quit acting. Dude was only getting looked at for stereotypical ""asian male"" roles for hollywood/tv.  It's gotten a lot better with the arrival of stuff like Crazy Rich asians, Shang Chi, and Everything Everywhere, but that's still such a tiny portion of everything."
Anyone can make a movie!
"This!

You know that movie ""21"", based on the true story about an MIT Black Jack Team genius students outsmarting Las Vegas casinos, where all of the actors were White except for one? Well IRL, they were all Asian-Americans, except for one person, who was a White woman..."
This comment reminded me of the Bruce lee story
Your cousin is a doofus. Cast Jackie Chan instead.
It’s hard for anyone to get roles in Hollywood
My man! I got your reference. [For anyone who didn't. Volume warning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WN71h43iR6U&feature=share&si=ELPmzJkDCLju2KnD5oyZMQ)
I’d be down to see a Hispanic/Latina Ariel too tbh
"They cast a latina for their future snow white remake, so there's that"
I’m sure you had no problem with Zoe Saldaña playing Nina Simone. Take your fake concern else where
"Or an Asian lead that isn’t a nerd, pothead, martial artist, evil mastermind, or super rich?"
Missed Steven Yeun (if you count “Nope”) and Ken Watanabe as well.
"Still not ten.

Strictly speaking, Jet Li, Tony Leung and Chow Young Fat should not count - because they were already HUGE stars in Asia when Hollywood put them into movie for easy cash grab in Asia.  

Michelle Yeoh is also like that: she was already huge in Asia when Hollywood finally put her in a movie.

BTW, Tony Leung has never led a Hollywood movie.

Bruce Lee, Sima Liu, Lucy Lou, Awkwafina and Constance Wu are the only ""made-in-Hollywood"" Asian leads in your list, (but Awkwafina has always played supporting instead of a lead.)"
"Yes, there are other characters now. There weren’t when I was a child; my point was that I’m one of these people that keep getting held up as the person they’re defending (“what about those kids that got bullied for having red hair and this character was important representation for them?!”) and yet I can see why it’s ok. 

I agree re the original drawing still existing. I’d also go as far as to say the original drawing will also still be held up as the ‘dominant’ version; no one really thinks of Naomi Scott when someone says Jasmine, or Lily James when they say Cinderella - they think of the more established cartoon version that’s been and still is slapped on every single piece of merchandise. The point being, there’s literally no reason to be *so* agitated. She’s not being replaced, even in popular consciousness, there’s just going to be a new Ariel as well."
"And my favorite, the little girl in Brave!

Is that Merida?"
"As an aside from this whole thing, a lot of cross racial casting has been redheads! MJ in the MCU also comes to mind."
"I think you’ve hit on an issue there that’s important. This kind of casting can come across as performative diversity, especially when Disney seemingly isn’t dedicating themselves to bringing black-written fairytales or black original characters on screen. 

That said, in this particular instance I think it’s a balancing out of a pantheon of characters that were historically white, in the story where it makes the most sense. 

If this is still happening in 20-30 years and original black stories still aren’t being told, then I think this argument would hold more weight. 

(I also wish they’d cast black actors for Eric and Ursula too, but there we are! Jordan Fisher and Laverne Cox were *robbed* in my opinion.)"
">>a lot of people hate the woke movement because it makes for awful films

Do you think that realistically, they’d put more effort into the movie with a white actor? Because the live action remakes with white actors are just as lazy. The real issue seems to be that remakes tend to be lazy and rely on source material as a crutch. 

And when people do make the original black characters, there’s still an extreme level of hate and criticism."
"Congratulations, you never understood the *point* of The Little Mermaid. It's that *race doesn't matter*; no barrier cannot be overcome by love. The fact that you think this is woke is just demonstration *that they had to do this*. You didn't get the point when it was subtle, now it gets screamed in your face."
"Hopefully the more these people expose themselves as lacking discernment, the less of an effect the review bombing will have on the movie’s financial prospects. Fingers crossed! 

That said, the hate this poor girl will receive will be inconceivable. I hope she’s ok and has a good team around her and support for her mental health. That’s the one part of the cross racial casting I struggle with; it feels like Disney is offering up these young performers on an altar to get hate from the racists while potentially reaping rewards themselves for demonstrating diverse casting. The same thing is happening to the sweet girl playing Annabeth in the PJO series. Really hope Disney puts their money where their mouth is and is investing their resources into providing ongoing support for their performers."
"You do realise they don’t recall the original movie when they do an adaptation, right? Ariel as I know and love her still exists, and will probably even still be what everyone thinks of first when they think of the character. 

Not to mention they also have Merida, and Anna. And Gisele in Disenchanted, which also just had a trailer drop."
Those videos have unashamedly made me cry! So very special
"People can relate to characters for all sorts of reasons.

If you get maligned for your looks - and minorities tend to get this the worst and with traumatic context - then a character that looks like you might be a huge deal."
"Yes I do, and I’ve said in several replies that I understand why this casting feels performative. 

However, there is also a pantheon of characters that have been fed to generations of young girls as inspiration, and that pantheon certainly until the ‘00s was predominantly white. So, to my mind, this is a balancing, in the story where it makes the most sense to affect the change. The value of seeing a character you already love and identify with looking like you may also be very powerful in the context of feeling underrepresented. 

We also have to acknowlege that we’re living in a culture that prioritises remakes and adaptations - these are the films that make money and what the studios want to do. The movies were adapting from (and I’m referring to more than just Disney here) are generally not diverse. If we keep that same casting for the sake of posterity we’re continuing deny POC representation and jobs, which is not the way to go. 

Anyway, as I said if you really can’t get over it you don’t have to watch it, but review bombing etc. is disrespectful and unnecessary."
"The CGI and tail rendering looks a lot better than what I was expecting. Although the colours used look slightly dull, and I loved the vibrancy of the original. Hopefully we’re just looking at a dark scene and they’ll still have the bright colours in other parts! I also wish they’d let her do more Broadway/belt vocals because it sounds like they’ve encouraged her to do a more modern/pop sound with the vocal runs and riffs and that doesn’t suit the music in my opinion. Beyoncé does the same in The Lion King and Ariana Grande did it in Hairspray Live and it just irritates me. One riff is ok, on every other note the music as written gets lost. 

I hold out hope! Lin Manuel Miranda has never put a foot wrong before! 

The amount of people telling me that I’m letting little girls who look like me get left behind is absurd. There’s a cognitive dissonance there between admitting how important representation is and not seeing what a huge step this is in favour of that. 

And lucky you on your redhead wife! As a fellow Ariel lover I hope the movie meets her expectations :))"
"I have no idea what you mean by this, could you clarify?

If you mean there are currently little white redhead girls out there who don’t have this character anymore; the original still exists, and there’s now Merida, and famously Anna from Frozen. Disenchanted is also coming up which stars Amy Adams, a gorgeous redhead. The girls will be ok, I promise!"
"I’m English, which might make the difference. 

Have heard redheads get better treatment in the US (and thus possibly elsewhere, but not sure.) Jessica Chastain does a funny bit on the Graham Norton Show about how horrified she was when she came to the UK about how we treat “gingers.”"
"This is a comment about my personal experience with this character; as someone with freckly pale skin, pale eyes and vivid red hair (not to mention half Irish being raised in England in the context of the Troubles and GFA), who was actively bullied for their looks, this character was meaningful to me in the pantheon of Disney princesses released at the time as one that looked like me. 

Kids going through my experience now have Merida, Anna, even Gisele. I did not; Ariel was it for me. 

So, I had a split second of disappointment when Halle Bailey was cast (especially because she reposted a fan image of her iteration with dark hair) that it wouldn’t look like me. Even if she had ketchup red hair added in post production that wouldn’t change for me, personally. But as I say I have made my peace with that, recognising that the greater good and need lies with black children and adults who have *never* seen themselves represented like this."
Irish crab pls
Jamaican crap is black and is also a servant to the princess. Making it an American Social norm.
Sebastian was Trinidadian.
"Apparently there is a crab called the Jamaican Red Crab, who knew?"
"Cause the original story had him as Jamaican. If the original were black there would be no issue. It’s like if they changed her hair from red to blue, doesn’t change the story still fucking weird that they did it."
He's a lobster lol.
"Subhuman black? Ok.

Nearly human black? Oh fuck no!"
"Based on a book with a completely different ending. 

If anything conservatives should be begging for the movie to become more accurate. In the actual story Ariel dies and becomes a slave for 300 years. During the time she’s a human she’s also in perpetual physical agony. 


I bet conservatives would be remarkably happy with the change to a black actor if Disney followed the original story more closely."
"There’s a big difference though. The point of Black Panther as a story is intrinsically tied to skin colour, unlike this example. The idea behind Wakanda is a world where Africa was free to thrive untouched by European colonialism. The only reason Wakanda exists is because of its strict isolationism. Having white Wakandans would violate the story both logically and thematically - which are the two parts of the story.

In comparison, the Little Mermaid is intentionally anachronistic. It’s loosely based on a Danish story, and the human world reflects this, but the underwater world is Greco-Roman, the villain is based on a famous drag queen and a Caribbean crab sings calypso songs. 

In general it’s harder to swap these situations around (from being about the majority to minority) because minority roles and media are much more likely to have that minority experience in its heart. Most mainstream American and British films with black/Asian leads have specific racial or cultural plots or themes that wouldn’t easily translate if they cast a different race. In media set in the past, non-white supporting roles will likely have some plot or thematic connection to race, because non-white people back then were treated differently to the majority. So some of these roles could be depicted by white actors, but most of the prominent examples can’t. 

When creators depict homogenous societies as diverse in media which doesn’t rely on racial themes/storylines, they’re forgoing accuracy to better represent the modern society they’re making the art for. This can be for emotional reasons or because they don’t want to exclude non-white actors from the vast majority of period roles. This is very different from most films with predominantly non-white casts in practical terms, not even thinking about the differences due to historical context."
"White is such a default for our entertainment that anyone who has a main character who isn't the ""default"" must be virtue signaling. What a ridiculous thing for racists to get upset about."
"“I’m only confused because we already separated the princesses by color, why aren’t they staying on their side?”

Dude, wtf.  This is not a permanent segregation by color, hate to disappoint you.  Start thinking of Ariel/people based on something other than her skin color, that’s the only solution needed here."
"So I guess the answer then is ""no, redheads don't get disproportionately re/cast as black, but they overwhelmingly get cast as non-redheads."""
I've never seen a blue whale in real life so they must not be real
https://www.curlcentric.com/can-black-people-have-red-hair/
There are movies meant for kids that can be enjoyed by everyone. Targeting kids is not an excuse to make god awful remakes.
"Marine mammales like whales, dolphins, seals, etc. are generally not pale skinned."
"Fair enough. You'd think they would have to be deep to go undetected for so long, though."
"Huh, thanks for the information!

Yeah, or how Godzilla doesn't collapse under his own body weight."
Clearly you've never seen Dr. Dolittle.
"Yeah but OG ariel was never black, why is overrepresentation the solution here, i dont get it, but i am also not american"
True. I think it would be funny if when she first met humans she sounds like some sort of abomination.
Not in that depth! My favorite mermaids are probably from the movie Underwater. I don't anyone of any skin color wants to be compared to those.
"Well I guess this comment was making the argument that if a species with human like anatomy (at least for part of their body) lived deep underwater where there was little sunlight, then evolutionary-wise there wouldn’t be any need for the species to have the melanin rich dark skin that black ppl have. Since human evolved black skin because they lived in areas with intense sunlight and having dark skin helps protect them from all the UV light they’re exposed to and natural selection favoured ppl with dark skin in those regions. I suppose the evolutionary pressure associated with living underwater would be similar to humans migrating further North where there’s less sunlight and then experiencing selection for pale skin (I think there’s also the fact that pale skin generate more vit D). 

But anyways that’s just if you rly wanna be more scientific about what the skin colour for a hypothetical fish-human species would be."
"Hmm. Maybe as a species though shouldn't they all look the same? Because at the end of the day they're not human. If they're all born in the deep they should all look like pale abominations. My favorite mermaids are from the movie Underwater. The film isn't the best but the mermaid design makes the most sense to me, given what we know about other creatures at extreme depths."
I think it would be neat if it were more like the mermaids from Underwater.
"Wow, that would be a really neat detail to have in the movie."
They have racist robots now? This is not the future I was promised!!
"A lot of people are tired of the “rinse-wash-repeat” of old IP adaptations and want new original stories. Disney is at the forefront of inclusive content (Encanto,Moana,Raya) albeit these are animated. 

People may not like casting thats different than the original story. Casting Pocahontas with anyone but a Native American would be asinine. We need good original stories based on different cultures and people."
"""n-no, it's not real! Everyone who dislikes this is a racist bot!"""
"Uh...what?  You do realize that there are quite a few people who are tired of Live Action adaptations of Disney movies in general, right?
I'm sure some of the dislikes are from racists, but it's just dense to say anything even approaching 100%, of them are."
Can't wait to see these same people upset at the Ariel casting take up arms when Hercules Mulligan is played by a 6.5 foot tall Scandinavian as part of the ironic Hamilton reboot in 30 years.
Which is crazy that’s allowed. Specifically and explicitly excluding one race is the most systemically racist thing I’ve seen today
"I legit SWEAR, I’ve seen people say it’s okay Hamilton casts black performers because they were “historically black”."
These are grown adults throwing temper tantrums over the skin color of a fictional fish… they probably don’t leave their houses for anything
You know how expensive those tickets are??
"Yeah, cuz I can't afford to - I enjoy them plenty when they're films/tv, and televised Hamilton has been great."
"The idea in Hamilton was that the young upstart revolutionaries are all cast as PoC, and only the King as ""the establishment"" is Caucasian. It was confirmed on [snopes](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/hamilton-non-white-casting-call/)."
"Also, In The Heights has specific race-casting, as it wouldn't be accurate to have Asians and Whites representing the barrio."
"That's just his cameo, he's helping with the music too lol"
You didn’t hear about it then because Internet forums were far more scarce and less trafficked in 97’ vs today.
& Whitney Houston was her fairy godmother!
"Because Who the fuck watched that? I’ve literally never heard of it until now.

Edit. Wow the made for TV movie didn’t have any outrage surrounding it? I’m so shocked"
That’s actually made me excited to see the movie. I hope he’s a man-crab.
Or...... She was maybe just the best person for the role from the people auditioned? Could be wrong but there's a non-zero chance that this was the case?
How is it not the same…? One is a fish woman. The only European in the film is prince eric and he’s been cast European.
"Daveed Diggs is not white, he’s mixed. His dad is black"
She’s literally half a fish.
">Hearing just a snippet of Halle Bailey’s “Part of Your World” made me tentatively optimistic that this one might be good??

bc they actually picked someone who is a singer first!"
"If only we could wait like 9 months and we'll know for sure if it fits this version of Ariel.  Nah, gotta call it wrong now with less than 10 seconds of singing!"
Doesn't mean she doesn't have feelings. She'll be fine financially and I don't think it will flop. But like people will probably go out of their way to harass her
Racist gamers
Same people that were upset about obscure DrSeuss books being banned and the sexy green M&M got less sexualized.
"And who proclaim loudly „I don’t see race!!!“

Well, at least not if it’s their own…"
"Dragons and magic, I sleep. 


Black mermaids? REAL SHIT"
That’s a good point. I really get angry about my mermaids and elves not being realistic enough. /s
Factsssss like when it happened with the new GOT show I was like eh I can see maybe why possibly they could be mad. Then in less than a week they are complaint about black people in the little mermaid and the new LOTR shows and now it’s just blatantly obvious they don’t want black people in their shows. At this point just admit that’s the reason and be done with it. Everyone who doesn’t agree with them already know that’s why and knows they are racists.
And seeing one causes them to have an existential crisis. Perfectly normal.
"Look, dragons, eternal life, reincarnation, and trolls I can handle. Differing levels of melanin is where I draw the line. Be reasonable. Yes immortal demon ghost warriors can exist. They just can't be black. Duh!"
"Oh no! Disney is making a cash grab? A bad movie!? There were giant dildos on the original little mermaid VHS cover, but this is a bridge too far.

Anyway…"
"I wouldn’t say all bad. I loved the jungle book remark, the visuals were stunning."
"I’m having a hard time caring about any of this. The movie isn’t for me. Mermaids aren’t real. Disney is a megacorporation focused on making money hand over fist. 

I’m commenting on the people who presumably are completed unaffected by this, but still mad that it’s happening."
Race is relevant to the character of Black Panther. It is not to Ariel
"I stopped at “woke propaganda”.

Oh shit, I’m a fascist now!"
The only way a black actor can be qualified to play a role is if they’re deliberately singled out?
"I think Luca is probably a good template to build the mermaid from. That movie was great btw, but it means they're likely humanoid but fish descendents i think. Then magically they become human so turn into mammals then. I think however an argument could be made for a vertical orientation being normal in that humans themselves are a rare example of it working. Just as well you can look at seahorses for an example of vertical orientation that works in that environment. Humans main claim to fame is being inexhaustible but also being so social tool use became the norm along with capacity for higher reason. This main weapon could reasonably be the main weapon for mermaids, speed and agility trading for trapping or some form of agriculture. but perhaps their head hinges more effectively so they can be vertical or horizontal ehile still retaining a more human appearance and orientation.So many questions..."
"The right wing culture war nonsense is exhausting.

Honestly at this point I think some Disney exec actually just secretly gets his rocks off provoking these people. And we get caught in the middle."
"This is such a trash take; parents care about the message kids movies send to their kids, as evidenced by the (positive) videos of kid reactions. Of course adults are going to have opinions. 

I’m not black so I don’t pretend to understand the representation struggle. What I *do* wonder is if this sends the message - or that the library of remakes in total sends it - that the only place for black actors is rehashing roles first played by white actors. That’s why Black Panther was so praised, here’s some fresh IP that’s black from the start."
That one was actually entertaining and written well. The modern remakes have been pretty trash.
"It's not her skin color, she just doesn't look like Ariel.

I could pick out another black girl that actually looks like Ariel.

Casting was terrible on this.

Edit

Off to Google...

julia lira red hair, there you go."
"You're living in fear of people who are upset over a movie.

People were pissed off about recasting the Ghostbusters as females. Guess what? We made it out of that alive."
"Exactly. So why let someone that worthless negatively affect you?

Anyone who experiences racism in person, especially any sort of physical violence, should absolutely fight back. By no means am I saying people should just accept racism.

But allowing yourself to get upset because people say racist shit online? Absolutely not. That is a complete waste of time."
"OK then stop amplifying the voices of racists by giving them attention. Ignore them. Move on. Focus on positive messages. Reach out to those you love. Don't focus on those who spread hate.

Have you ever been to 4chan? It's a fucking cesspool of racism, bigotry, misogyny and just complete stupidity. You know what happens when you react to them? *They fucking love it.*

So what should I do? Be upset about all the terrible things that are said on 4chan every single day? Or should I just ignore it all and focus on more positive things? The answer is obvious.

This Little Mermaid backlash is no different."
"What makes that worse is, you know that decision would never have been considered if GitS had a canonical black protagonist. But, since she was Asian, casting a white actor was deemed ok."
I’m not. Never will be.
"Yeah I’m white and I’m having some serious self reflection of the communities I thought I belonged too. The lord of the rings has always been like a drama free area of Reddit (at least it seemed that way) but damn guess I was wrong lol. This is what i have found a lot of my white peers have a hard time understanding: when we say “acknowledge your white privilege” they immediately shut down. And that’s a problem that I’ve learned people have to fix themselves. There’s just a point where you can’t argue with a person, when they get that zeal about defending their point. I’m frustrated as hell."
"I mean, equal is the goal, but we're still a far way away from that"
"They're not taking a risk to make some little girl happy. They're playing identity politics to make money, that's the problem."
"There's a difference between taking a Polynesian character, a historically underrepresented group, and making them white and taking a white girl and making her black. There is no reason a mermaid can't be black."
"Probably, but for different reasons."
"The color of Ariel’s skin also has no impact on the story whatsoever. At all. Making her a POC does not detract from the message being portrayed.

Maui is a Polynesian god.

racists out here like ""but you wouldnt like it if we cast a white guy as Malcolm X???"""
"""They should hire the best candidate/cast the best actor and stop looking at race"" is almost always a dogwhistle that implies the ""best candidate"" would naturally be white, so unfortunately you won't see a lot of the ""they should just cast the best actor"" folks arguing that they probably just cast the best actor."
"I hope the backlash doesn’t drive her away from acting, she really does have a nice voice"
Definitely a great voice.
"I read that after Halle Bailey auditioned, they didn’t want to see anyone else. So she clearly wowed them. I had/have more of a problem with Emma Watson being Belle when she just couldn’t sing. 

I’m a white woman over 30 and let me tell you, I was teary eyed when I heard the original score in the trailer. When Halle started singing, I was fully  ugly crying. I can’t imagine how wonderful those little girls felt seeing Ariel look like them. I’m hopeful that this remake will be really good as a whole and I can’t wait to see more of Halle."
"That’s my issue. She can hit notes, but her tone is not right for this musical. They’ve just blackwashed The Little Mermaid, which is really cool, and starts to get Disney farther into global domination."
I could’ve sworn I heard that the director saw Halle Bailey perform at the Grammy’s and instantly wanted her to audition.
"More like she knocked it out of the ballpark during the audition. 

Your whole thought is pure laziness."
Like seeing action hero fierce Princess Leia was to the generation when women were just the hero's sweetheart and 99% blonde blue eyes and docile.
"Yeah, I definitely was holding back a tear...or two. You could tangibly see and feel the impact it had on them."
Ginger Karens.
She's also going to get tons more positive fame and lots of money! I'm sure she knew what was coming. She grew up a black girl already so....
"But does he identify as Jamaican?
Does he identify as he?"
"Plenty of naturally red crabs, FYI."
"fair, perhaps bioluminescence is less of a fish appropriation for a deep sea dweller"
"Nah, Disney definitely tends towards clear vocals without a ton of embellishment. Her voice is good but definitely not classic Disney.

Edit:: Idk why y'all are mad. Disney doesn't traditionally have a lot of vocal runs in the songs and she definitely is doing it in the trailer."
"This movie wasn't really on my radar. Excited for it now, can't wait to hear her sing through the entire movie."
It’s true. It’s a tradition going back over a thousand years
"I mean it is kinda weird that gingers in Hollywood a lot of times are recast with black women if they redo the movie. Not that I really care, just sayin"
Really? As a redhead that makes me happy but idk if I buy it
You reading this thread?
She’s definitely the only ginger I’m aware of whose hair doesn’t look brown underwater lol
The dominant “race” you already know the answer.
"They totally do, if you want I can track down the movies Disney and Pixar have made recently. Ultimately we are seeing a pendulum swing to balance out Walt Disney's nazi roots, it won't last forever. In the meanwhile we are actually seeing lots of really cool non white characters that I personally prefer as well.

That said getting mad over the race of any fictional character is an emotional reaction. As two white guys we have much less justification to be emotional about this particular subject. I will say this though, I im8gine many non white people would prefer original characters as well"
"Ah yes, the old ""reverse racism"" argument."
You must be bad at math.
They wouldn’t have watched it regardless.
i betcha its the most successful remake actually
"This is a different case IMO. One was someone taking away from a role that would have otherwise been a welcome addition to cinema, as Asian people have typically been underrepresented in modern American cinema."
"She isn’t, she is from the fucking sea."
"And Shakespeare was an English writer, but cultures worldwide have adapted his works. Are you going to bitch if some school in NY wants to do a play and uses a diverse cast? How many black girls do you think were named Ariel because of the movie. My niece is one such girl (now a woman, and she does have natural red hair). 
Not so long ago, the Mormon church started to open membership to blacks. Now the church is all over Africa, the Caribbean, and Latin America looking for members. Why is this? Yes, some beliefs may have changed, but they also had to face reality. They needed to expand and spread their gospel beyond their limited base. Likewise, Hollywood is in this to make money first. This is why Pixar, Disney, and other studios have been making movies like Mulan, Kung Fu Panda, and Coco. No one is going to forget the original little mermaid if Hollywood decides to make the fictional character Chinese, Indian, or Hispanic. And why didn’t people complain about the stereotypical West Indian crab in the movie that sang calypso. Is calypso Danish? Hollywood has always taken stories and changed them, it isn’t known for its originality. From the retelling of the Japanese Seven Samurai, to an African Dracula in Blacula, to a European  cyborg in the live action Ghost in a Shell, Hollywood is known for lifting from other cultures. There are so many movies that borrow from black cultures, though the characters may be talking animals, or a mostly white human cast. Europeans have been talking stories from other cultures for centuries and adapting and changing them. A few weeks ago, I saw an exhibition that was centered around Whistler’s painting of a woman in a white dress. I remembered the impact of Japanese art on him, and those influences were evident in some of his works. And what about Picasso’s debt to African art? I could go on about the borrowing and appropriation of art, music, stories, and believe systems (Mythologies) from other cultures, but any learned person should know this. Finally, the multi cultural space in which we live is a result of your European ancestors encroaching and remaking the world to suit their needs and wants. Cultures borrow from each other (even though Hollywood’s ultimate goal is about making money and expanding their brands), so if you don’t have a problem with Elvis, or a blonde Jesus, you shouldn’t have a problem with a fictional black mermaid, or werewolf."
Any source on that?
"I know. “Got one black princess, that’s plenty!” 

Ridiculous. Tiana spent the majority of that movie as a frog and the movie did involve her struggles as a single black woman in the south trying to start a business. 

Ariel’s skin color doesn’t have any impact on the story at all. The bigots are really struggling."
"“Their water fountain is right over there!”  Agreed, it’s insane that they still think that separating people by race is solving the issue."
"Hey, don’t forget how many people thought it was okay to be openly racist under the guise of Dave Chappelle, or that racism doesn’t exist just because Obama was elected, ignoring the fact that a black college professor was arrested for getting the newspaper on his own lawn just months after the election.

It’s not even worth worrying about at this point. I wonder how everyone would have felt if Eminem was completely isolated simply due to the fact that Vanilla Ice and Third
Base made hip hop white enough…"
"The color of Ariel’s skin also has no impact on the story whatsoever. At all. Making her a POC does not detract from the message being portrayed. 

It should not matter and these adults crying over black Ariel need to see past this ignorance."
I am pretty certain that the Venn Diagram of people objecting to this and to Sam Wilson succeeding to the title of Captain America just as he did in the source material is a circle in Hell.
Noooo!! Little kids really care about race a lot and definitely weren't being coached by their parents. Don't you remember discussing race on the playground when you were a little kid? ^***/S***
They should probably stay away from the 1997 movie Cinderella lol half the cast is black
"No, they got triggered with meghan Markle and prince Harry. Can't half a half black princess!! Lol"
We know.  What I meant was they will remove the thumbs down button that you can still press to send your dislike to the creator.
"Yeah, ive gotta take this to heart."
"Yeah, cool, but they’re not are they? Are there really that many people who are upset about this? Seems crazy!"
another reason to vote No Hama in 2024
"What?? Thank you for telling me that! I’m so excited to rewatch it, I haven’t seen it in years"
"Normal people would never be upset the color of an imaginary character was changed.  
Mermaids, hobbits, elves.. these are not real. They have no race."
Not all Republicans are openly and proudly racist.
"Mermaids real common in the Prince’s social circle, are they?"
She was played by an Asian on stage and racist were still mad
I guess the mermaid population is dwindling
How many mermaids do YOU know?
"Because they just did Mulan two years ago, and Raya last year, and Turning Red this year?"
Woke us just a neo slur now it just replaces old slurs in a more palatable manner please stop with the bs
But it was still an original  film. It wasn't  just a rehash of an existing  film. I'm  not a fan of live action  remakes in general.
"That’s highly unlikely to be the reason why it has the most dislikes of any remake they’ve come out with, but of course if you dislike Disney remakes your probably not gonna enjoy it, and are entitled to not enjoy it. It’ll never do what the cartoon did exactly, and people can feel anyway they’d like about the movie. People complaining about the CASTING can eat shit."
"Because they aren't racists and put a ""whites only"" sign on their casting door? So they opened the door to anyone who walked in"
If you are looking for little kids on the internet do I have some bad news for you...
So honestly Cinderella and Pete's dragon is the only ones I didn't see. So maybe I'll check them out. The jungle book I didn't like.
Jews aren’t white?
I’m pretty sure there are a few. Such as the Romans.
"There were definitely white people in the Bible, they nailed dude to a cross."
"These things you can spot a mile away. Also, which  one of these remakes improved on the original?"

The graphics in general. No shit the actress cant sing underwater.
No it's just sad to see how some people have a total meltdown when the shoe is on the other foot.  They still fail to understand.
Idk but i can explain snow yellow!
"You’re right they are. They are here to entertain the masses. Keep them happy, sedate, placid. One of the oldest tricks in the book. Ancient Rome did the same thing. If the populace got rowdy and mouthy then give them free bread and games in Coliseum. They’ll forget about what they were upset about in the first place. This is all a game and anyone that buys into this is getting played."
"The director changed it. He's a white guy, you can take it up with him, if you like"
"But what if the new creator of this movie wanted to do it differently isnt he allowed to do that ? Regardless of what people feel is right or wrong ? 
Its his project as much as it was disneys project back in the day ?"
"That's too good an idea when they can just milk the older stuff, I think they do it every once in awhile but it's not often."
"Ariel having a different skin tone doesn’t change the story at all. I could understand getting upset if the character’s actor wasn’t cutting it, but because the skin tone is different? Yeah there’s racism behind that. Maybe not active bigotry against that actor in particular, but societal programmed racism indeed."
"“Racial swapping” a character from a fairytale. If not having a character represent your race is that bad, you could understand the need for black princesses. It’s not a big deal, unless you’re a little black girl who’s always seen Ariel as white or a racist"
"You are correct. Also a mermaid doesn't have a race, It's a half-fish monster."
I'll believe that the crowd that cries about race swapping doesn't have racist motivations when they start petitioning to make Jesus the right color in all depictions of him.
Is Areal caucasoid? Did the mermaids originate from the Caucasus mountains? Are they western or Eastern European? Irish? English? Dutch? Please tell me more about the race of mermaids
"Lmao, yes the traditionally white underwater fish people.


You folks are clowns"
Its a work of fiction. What race are mermaids supposed to be anyway?
"Mermaids are Caucasian? 

News to me."
"Yes, pretty much. Having a problem with the race of the character when it makes no difference to the character is by definition racist"
Nope. Those are exactly what it means.
And theres nothing you can do about it. How does that feel?
Can you give me a good reason to be against it?
">Cant be any other reason…right?

Well, what's the reason? It was that way in a cartoon about a fish lady seems kinda weak to me?"
Well the only people I see bitching about it are racist
"If I could get these dogshit Disney remakes to fail, I'd be a happy man. Alas, I cannot. I can laugh at all the white knights leghumping a mega corporation though."
Nope. Originally she has been portrayed white. She should remain white. I merely stated that because I knew some assclown was going to state that as a defense. Unless you’re fine with established black characters becoming white?? Hmm probably not.
"Yeah, just your average ivory white dude."
"Idk man, the other one is a cartoon, and this is live action? I thought it'd be slightly more grounded or something

E: just curious why you deleted the comment calling me a cunt and saying the little mermaid had black sisters?

When I google that, I can only see one with black hair. Could you link a source? I'm interested in reading more. Thanks :)"
"You see the problem.

The best way to make representation is to show characters that are originally black, asian, latinos, native-american, etc. Instead of simply race-swapping other characters. Thats demeaning to originally diverse characters."
Hey Disney! Listen up!
"Shit, good call."
"Wait, when did race play a role in Mulan?"
"Ppl are justifying their racism by saying black ppl can’t exist as mermaids And giving pseudo science responses. They are doing the same for the lord of the rings show, saying black ppl can’t can’t be elf’s. They go to extreme lengths to be “accurate to lore” and give in world historic and sociological reasons. yet also can’t understand real life history and social economic policies that lead to the real life systemic racism and oppression."
"
of course. You think fat adult people who lose their mind when a fantasy character for little girls is slightly changed are reasonable people?"
"Lotta black people out there who like to tell other black people who have lighter skin, who may “talk white” or takes their education seriously that they’re not “black enough.”  Super toxic shit and makes it super hard for a lot of mixed people to find a place to fit in."
More black?
I hope its soulja boy
this isn't true at all
Now I know you are a troll. Just lying and lying. I bet it never gets tiring for you.
"Probably because you're seeing it through your own lens.  

Have you seen any of these young children's reactions? If not , look it up . If such a little thing makes children happy,  then who are we to fight about it"
"This is Disney we're talking about. It's always about what will give them the best PR and will keep people talking. Every casting decision about each of these ""live action"" movies is 100% intentional. If they didn't care about the diversity angle we'd see a Scandinavian actress in a red wig. Because let's be honest, 

They didn't know how insulting this would end up being though. A lot of black people are offended (not about this movie specifically, but about diversity casting in general) because these companies would change something that already has a cultural identity (Danish) instead of doing something that actually aligns with their culture (like princess and the frog) 

Which, in case you didn't know this, I REALLY want a princess and the frog live action movie lmao."
OK anti-White racist.
What does racist hate-brigading mean?
So I could see what’s up
"There’s a few I can think of that they haven’t done yet. Hercules is the main one that comes to mind. 

Amazing how they have all this money and access to some of the most creative minds but they continue to pump out remakes. Unless they all make it big in the box office? I don’t have kids so I have no idea how well these remakes do with the younger crowds"
Yes.  Yes I am.  Find a Republican that (1) doesn't believe the 2020 election was stolen and (2) won't force women to give birth to headless babies and maybe I'll believe a few of them aren't complete monsters.
"No lol, I watch movies for entertainment, not to study for a PhD in history haha"
What historical person does Ariel the make-fkn-believe mermaid represent exactly?
"Humanoid fish called “Ariel” and the film being called “the little mermaid”, sure I’d prefer the casting to be similar to the original film and not hiring for the sake of diversity. Tell me why  didn’t they cast an Asian girl or an Indian girl?

The dislikes tell you all you need to know. Or are they all trolls and racists?"
"No, the merpeople can be any race, it just doesn’t make sense for a European mermaid story"
"i dont care if shes black or purple, its another dogshit adaptation by disney to cash in on money from weak minded fucks like you, but keep projecting your insecurities miserable fuck"
"And is not there is many brilliant black actor and director who can crate something new , this is a lazy attempt"
"For the same reason I don't want to see movies make black characters white.
It's either intentionally controversial or pandering. 

""Look! White character is black! Corporation good now!""

""Black character white! Corporation bad! Let's talk about them for the next month!"""
I know I'm so excited. It's a huge pet peeve of mine when they cast actors in musicals who just can't sing. Hollywood does it frequently so this is a nice change.
She was white. Stop.
And people who care about skin color always say what you just said about what I said. You are clearly the racist.
If you were attempting to look like an idiot then you can consider your post a success.
"Stop your shameless virtue signaling. We're not taking about plot, doofus."
Race was relevant to black panther. Race has nothing to do with the little mermaid. Stop making it about race
"“ a faithful adaptation of the source material” 

Everything must be exactly the same? This is another version. I love beauty and the beast, I don’t need the new version to be  the same because it’s a new interpretation. Their cartoon version had a white girl with red hair. This new version is a black girl with red hair. She was picked because she was the best audition. Why is this so hard to understand? 
Why are you not open and adaptable to seeing a new version of a story? 

Brandy was Cinderella in *one* version of Cinderella and that one of my favorite alternative Cinderellas because they took the story and added some sass that wasn’t in the OG, it’s just a fun movie. The new Disney Cinderella looked exactly the same as the original character and the movie was hot garbage anyway."
"Neato now zoom out, and see all their releases. What a fucking moron."
Idk yes?
I guess they also have bill burr too but he's bald so you can't quite tell
"I mean, judging from the reactions its clear that they would be if most of them weren't white.

But no one was talking about old racist Disney, so much as the modern Disney these ""people"" take issue with."
"Not really, no. Just like Candice Owens doesn't indicate that black people oppose BLM. One example doesn't disprove a trend."
">Strange Worlds

Challenge Accepted"
I didn’t say it was a sequel.
Definitely not paying a well known racist band millions for music
"The double standard is that they will support Halle Bailey (as they should), but they didn’t do the same with John Boyega."
It might not for me but it could for someone else. You clearly don't care so maybe find a better use of your time?
I hope so. I’m a 50 year old straight white dude. And the music of the little mermaid still makes my cry a little.  I’m not ashamed to admit that at all.  It’s that good.
"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smithsonian-institution/Elusive-Ultra-black-Fishes-Are-Cloaked-to-Survive-the-Deep-Ocean-180975367/. 

>Being invisible, on the other hand, may be a better strategy for escaping predators and moving through the water undetected by prey. In a new study published last week in Current Biology, researchers have discovered an evolutionary tactic that gives some fishes an invisibility cloak. For the first time, an ultra-black skin color or pigmentation that protects 16 varieties of deep-sea fishes has been documented and studying the efficient survival tactic could provide insight into developing new synthetic camouflage materials as well as have implications for the understanding and treatment of skin cancers.   


Of all the things that make no sense about a singing mermaid, dark skin is the least questionable.

"She has not been replaced. The original Danish tale still exists. The Disney version has always been innacurate as fuck anyway and the old animated adaptation, it's sequel and all the other Content about it does not cease to exist because this adaption has a black actress. The black Cinderella in the 90s didn't replace the white one that came before her. It was just a different adaptation. 

Y'all need to chill. Like yes, original stories about black characters would be amazing. But let people find the joy in what wins they do get because capitalism ain't gonna let many 150 million dollar original films get made and this that do will be as financially safe as possible."
If you think they are making all these live action movies for any other reason than to renew the trademarks then you are lying to yourself. All they care about is the continued ability to cash in on stories they have stolen and bastardized.
"The hateful comments in this thread say otherwise. You care as well, or why did you comment?"
"Singing is just a part of the consideration. In my opinion, story should be the main consideration. Disney have made it about race not me, main characters who are black is trendy now (eg. Bridgeton).

Like I said, if they made Ariel black, the rest of the family better be black too. If not, it’s just bs because the story has taken a backseat."
"I just said that Disney is doing it for virtue signaling and money, not for fighting racism. I literally don’t give a fuck about her race, I have no doubt she’s an amazing actress that deserves the role.
But if you think that Disney is really for “race is not important to us”, try to ask them to do Mulan with a white girl instead. See how that goes and how is received, even if like you said (and I agree) there’s no point in be obsessed in race."
"Sure, and those were original stories based off of the classic characters.

But the live action versions do a lot of weird things, like truncating classic songs in Lion King and Aladdin, or in the case of Mulan, completely changing the format of the movie."
Ah yeah the trailer lmaooo mixed that up.
Were you upset Nick Fury was played by Samuel L. Jackson?
"No, it's racism, pure and simple."
"Are you sure it’s not the studios and the media pointing the finger at fans to deflect from the fact they’re producing poorly written and executed garbage?

Edit: of course im not denying racism. Im just saying it might be a convenient cover for the studios"
"Have you ever been at the parks? People bitch for everything. You encounter daily the worst people you can ever imagine. The meanest people on earth. 

I don’t see this ending well regarding the meet and greets, Disney will end up removing Ariel from the parks until they figure out what to do. As I said, any decision they take will  not end up well."
"My point is that bar seems to move.

If a classic African tale was recast with a white actor, do you think race would be seen as inconsequential?

Social media and social justice outfits complain about the likes of James Franco playing someone he is ethnically & physically similar to, but nobody is allowed to question even the cases where black people are being cast as actual white people from history. It's mad."
"I thought, how bad can it be? It's Tom Hanks!  It's a wooden puppet that he talks to,  like Wilson in Cast Away!

It... was... awful.  Just really uninspired.

Jim Carrey talking with his butt cheeks was a vastly better movie going experience."
"oh we’ll thats good to hear, i think they could do something cool with a african inspired mermaid culture but im sure they wont"
Nah.  It's just a kids movie.  The fact that ADULTS like you are booing their bums out is funny but also very sad.  If only y'all cared this much about the daily mass shootings of children and things of that sort.  Priorities people.
"What!!!  
I’m sorry, but the musical masterpiece written by Howard Ashman and Alan Menkin must not be tampered with. Every note from beginning to end of the Little Mermaid is a work of art and cannot be changed.  I hope Disney realizes that."
"Oh, that's a shame if true. ""Kiss the Girl"" is one the more memorable songs from The Little Mermaid."
"That’s where I think they fail and hate how the movie industry has deviated towards this. 

If they put out a, “submit your ideas for a “black/african/pacific islander” mermaid movie” and combined the best. They’d have the coolest movie ever. 

God i wanna make movies. We need cool, OG movies that rile people up only with excitement and joy!"
Only a certain group of people are mad for some reason
Big yikes
Hamilton was awesome
"There is alot tension in you. Read what I wrote again and come back to me and just maybe I will discuss with you. Dont assume you know me, you don't."
"THEY LOOK LIKE THE CHARACTERS

That's all that matters to me.

99% of live actions are trash and I will likely hate it too.

But will have a love hate relationship for netflix even trying to stick with the looks."
"Shut uuup dude. Get a fucking reality check. Unbelievable. 

*Best actress for the role*

Never have I ever witnessed such clutching at straws"
Not when she’s selling out to a dogshit corporation who has a horrible human rights record
"Of all the unexpected memey ""Netflix adaptation"" with unexpected casting this one really seems cool."

Best thing ever. Restoring honesty within democracy.
Does it show actual dislikes or is it only from those who use that extension as well?
That's a very creative name
"Yup, pretty great, glad I have it, you really need to see the likes to dislikes on some videos to know if the content is worth watching.  I get by hiding it less people will dislike.

1.6m Dislikes is crazy though, sad but crazy."
"So wait. You have to install an extension to be able to dislike a YouTube video but then only other people with the extension can see the dislikes?

Sounds like a big circle jerk of negativity to me."
And it isn’t reliable.
">Return Youtube Dislike

This is great - what other chrome extensions do you like?"
"I thought youtube took someone to court to try and say using that was ""hacking"" toutube, sonit would get banned/removed?"
Firefox version?
Oh I'm getting that. If only this existed for the bloody app
"It would be good to see, from which regions, the dislikes originate. That would be make great reading.."
"Oh my god, I love web developers."
Oh I'm definitely getting that extension
"> Return Youtube Dislike

Is there an extension that returns the date of when the videos were uploaded?"
Yeah but that extension is not accurate.
It's also on firefox
Which is why Chrome is disabling extensions. FireFox for the win!
why download software that broadens your exposure to negative comments
We will teach them of our peaceful dislike button……by force
Star Wars: Return of the Dislike
"I caught that TFS reference, Alucard"
A Revengeance
The return of the why-boner… with a vengeance.
Somehow the dislike button returned
it's 1.7M dislikes now
"It attempts to guess the total number of dislikes by extrapolating from its userbase, so taking it at face value means assuming that the people who would take the time to download that extension are a representative sample of all of Youtube. Without information from YouTube or the channel holder, we can't know how accurate it really is.

The article refers to the number of dislikes as three different times as ""thousands"", ""hundreds of thousands"", and ""nearly a million"". I don't know if they're updating it as the count rises, or if they're just being vague to avoid inaccuracy."
All racist jerks
I liked when yahoo eliminated likes/dislikes and only gave you the option to heart a comment
One thousand five hundred thousands is 500 million.
"Just a note, none of the other remakes have gotten this level of dislikes.

Even though in my opinion they are all equally bad."
"interesting, wish there was an accurate way to see them

do we know how/why they're inaccurate?"
"It’s not perfectly accurate but it is pretty close and gives an idea of what the ratio looks like. It gathers data from everyone who uses the extension obviously, but also has the data for the millions if not billions of videos pre-dislike removal. So if it has millions of dislikes, the extension is going to show that. It won’t have it to the number unless the creator chooses to share their data with the app which they can do."
"It gives an estimate based on how many people with the extension disliked the video. Most people who use the dislike button probably have the extension. If anything, that just means that the real amount of dislikes is even higher"
Much better than nothing
Obvious bot attempt.
I hate gingers
Because anyone who complains is a racist. Also stupid.
"Exactly, Disney has a clear agenda, I mean they literally made Snow White a black
Character. Sad what they have become, there are some many great original stories from black creators and instead they choose to recreate classics with black actors it’s hilarious"
"Because people complaining about the TRAILER like this are LIKELY FUCKING RACISTS.  Every single comment about why “people will think it’s going to be bad” are HIGHLY LIKELY racists.  I mean you ever remember any other big Disney remake getting this much flack from people 9 months before release based on a trailer?  Yeah didn’t think so.

Go read the racist as fuck comments about the movie.  Or the “woke” guy who redid it with AI so the person was white.

It’s fucking SICKENING.  The movie is close to a year away still.

People should be COMMENDING Disney for doing this - it’s called being inclusive.  You think young black children don’t deserve strong characters who match their skin tone so they can try and believer they aren’t alone in dealing with shit head racists like everyone who’s already hating on a movie that’s not even out yet?

Seriously go fuck off you asshole dimwit.

Don’t bother replying either as I’m blocking you after I hit add comment."
"Hilarious seeing morons triggered by the skin color of a mermaid. Whatever keeps the wheels on your culture war turning, though!"
Muh libruls
">but still made the information publicly accessible.

It's not. The addon is extrapolating based on its users so there is a clear bias."
Hes probably just not being honest. He wanted to see a hot pale redhead mermaid.
"This is a good comparison because some of the Last Airbender casting *did* get criticism at the time since cultural influence/representation played a key role in the property, but it was nowhere near as much as something like this gets."
"Pretty sure the fairy tale never had a Caribbean crab, so it's not like it's ever been a paragon of accuracy.

I just don't like the live action reboots. They've all been mediocre or worse."
She’s also a mermaid who turns into sea foam when he rejects her… I don’t think it really matters what her skin colour is.
Doesnt the mermaid in the original danish fairytale has a green skin and dies at the end ?
"So did you have a problem with the Disney version, which heavily relied on Caribbean and Jamaican themes and music?  Obviously you don’t have an issue now so I’m not interested in grilling you, I’m just curious as to why you never thought about it that way."
"Whitewashing is bad!

This is no big deal! 
 people seem to be OK being “inconsistent”."
Too dumb to even pick an analogy that makes sense? She isn't called the White Little Mermaid. Being white is not a part of her character. Idiot.
"What a load of horseshit. What does the ""ethnicity"" of a an imaginary  magical creatures change about the story in any meaningful way? It's also a remake of the Disney version, which is itself an unfaithful bastardization of the original story. Also, why do remakes have to the exact same thing anyway? If you want the same exact thing that already exists, just watch the first thing."
Is being faithful to the original really so dependent on the color of her skin? Lol jesus
"The extension doesn't know the number of dislikes, it is extrapolating the behavior of people who downloaded the extension. 

Bias sample to extrapolate imo"
"It’s just an estimate, not accurate at all"
"Hercules honestly. Training montage of him yelling at himself, him rescuing himself as a damsel, him yelling at himself while on fire. 10/10 perfect movie."
Beauty & The Beast. The ballroom scene alone would be worth it.
Something like Bambi where they let him redo the dubs and then just clumsily paste his talking head on all the corresponding characters.
"The Sorcerer’s Devito

“So anyways, I started sorcerin’…”"
"Danny White and the Seven Devitos.

Just like the original, each Devito is a different version/emotion of Danny’s. 

It’s just a twist that instead of a princess, he’s the original Devito."
Oliver and Company
"That's a trick question, he would make every Disney movie better that way."
Wasn’t he in dumbo?
"Snow White, for sure."
Hear me out: Snow White. Danny DeVito is Snow White. All seven Danny DeVito dwarves. Danny DeVito evil Queen. Danny DeVito witch hag. I just thought of this ten seconds ago and now it’s all I want for the future

Though the most baffling one for me was the live action Jungle Book.

Cut most of the songs waaay down like Bare Necessities, or reduce to just musical background like Kaa's Trust In Me... then reveal King Louie as this mythically-proportioned, terrifying, Christopher Walken-voiced monster ape advancing menacingly on Mowgli... then have him suddenly break out and do the entirety of Wanna Be Like You?!"
"Do they have the staying power? I love the animated beauty and the beast. We went to the premiere. And I haven’t watched it again. It was awful. The autotune, the dress, it was just terrible. I guess if you only care about ticket sales because you don’t need anything else it works but ugh. They’re just smearing their reputation"
"Surprisingly though, Aladdin wasn't too bad."
"To be honest, I have avoided all of the live action remakes simply because I think the experience would ruin my nostalgia/memories of the originals, whether or not the movies were a success."
"This. I was so excited (I was in 4th grade when the og came out and to say I was a super fan would be an understatement). I was ready to belt be prepared to myself whilst dancing in my seat, embarrassing my husband… and then we got that crap. As my east Texas granny liked to say “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it”"
"With how effective Disney has been at extending copyright laws, the movies they are remaking - even one as old as Pinocchio - still have decades to go before they need to worry about their IP. It's just a cash grab."
"They made that movie too adult. They figured the kids who grew up watching lion king would want to see a mature version of lion king “what if we have real life photo realistic lions…only lion king” when in reality what we wanted was lion king. I would take that YouTube big eyes emotional faces version anytime.

Like this: https://youtu.be/Y1HGgICqZ3c"
Well that killed my hype for the movie :(
Yup. Every single ounce of me wanting to see it just died. I can't stand Melissa McCarthy... Aerial looks awesome though. I hope Halle Bailey absolutely dominates that role!
Get ready for a fart bubble joke or 12.
"I've never seen the Little Mermaid. I don't care about the Little Mermaid. I won't ever see the Little Mermaid so this all has no bearing on me at all...

...and i still felt the sheer, utter, and complete weight of that ""God damn it"" down in my soul.

Sorry. I really am."
This is the only acceptable reaction.
"Why would they self-sabotage this lmao the circumstances of Treasure Planet were entirely different, there’s a good documentary on Youtube about that whole situation. They casted her because she’s a safe and easy choice with a name that, like it or not, will get asses in seats. Maybe not ours, but others."
It doesn't if you're Melissa McCarthy.

Yes. YES.
"No, should be played by Gary Busey"
OMG!!! 100% YES!!!!
This is exactly what I wanted.
I'm a grown man with no interest at all in the Little Mermaid. Would definitely watch if this was the casting.
"That would be so wild and fun,Titus can sang!"
Yeah it’s undeniable
You mean you pictured [this](https://youtu.be/rfBfuR8Jiqw)?
"I like Melissa McCarthy in general,I think she is funny and has her own charm,but does she sing at all?"
Why do you say that? Melissa McCarthy is a pretty good actress.
...and doesn't even remotely resemble anything that makes Ursula iconic.
Nothing non-binary about Ursula.
Oh hed 100% kill it are you kidding me.
Jinkx would be hilarious! I'd love to see that.
"What the *fuck,* that's a terrible casting. That's the thing people should be pissed about."
Melissa is great but doesn't give the sinister Ursula vibes
Melissa McCarthy should have been the chef chasing Sebastian around.
"Lizzo’s favorite person - self-proclaimed - is Chris Brown. 

I’m sure she can find it somewhere in her."
I think a pissed off Queen Latifah would be an epic Ursula
"Yeah, go watch One Hour Photo. That movie will change your mind about ""too nice and goofy."""
Just tell her Ariel is fatphobic
Don’t sell lizzo short like that. She’s a talented mf
I hope she’s one of the muses in the inevitable Hercules remake.
"I'm guessing based on the u in ""coloured"" that you're not American but jsyk, that wording is generally considered a slur now in the US as it's associated with segregation. Just thought you should know."

"Ohhhhhhhhh yeah, that's right. I still wouldn't call it Jafar's song, but fair."
"I just looked, and yeah, she is. Welp. I'm out."
"Mulan also removed the core message of hard work, determination, bravery and leadership and replaced it with ""she has more magic"" or something.  Definitely not as good from many angles."
They all have voices Jacob Trembley is Flounder and Daveed Diggs is Sebastian.
">it'll just be more proof they use these movies as just a cash break

Businesses have only cared about cash breaks basically since cash existed."
"This is not entirely related to what you said, but Mulan. I was in Disneyworld’s Animal Kingdom looking at anklets. This cast member came over and started up some Disney convo with me. Asked me my favorite Disney princess (I’m an adult there with my own kid). I said Mulan, and then she replies “Did you know that Mulan has the highest verifiable kill count in any Disney movie?!” She started spitting Murder Mulan facts at me with a swiftness that not even an air bender could dodge. Considering their persistently positive attitudes, I thought this (morbid) exchange was hysterical. Years later, she is still by far my favorite cast member of all time and I think about her sometimes.

I’m done with my mostly unrelated tangent, just thought I’d share."
"they’re not. scuttle, sebastian, and flounder are all cast. composer alan menken from the original movie has returned, lin manuel miranda joined (original lyricist howard ashman passed in 1991), and they wrote 4 new songs in addition to including the songs from the original.

halle bailey wasn’t cast for brownie points like i keep seeing said either. [go on youtube and listen to her sing](https://youtu.be/T4MajGTp1x8), or watch interviews and see what her personality is like. even if everything else about the movie turns out horribly, she 100% has the spirit of the character and a stellar voice."
"I mean the whole story is about Ariel singing and then trading her voice for life as a human on the surface, so it would be kinda hard removing the songs from it."
"They’re probably going to remove or heavily demote the singing animals because for some reason it really gets the Chinese censors excited when animals are elevated to the same level as human characters. 

More importantly, the entire driving force of the plot is Ariel wanting to break out of an oppressive society and experience life in a free world that’s been denied her. Disney wants the Chinese market too bad to piss off the CCP that much, so they’re going to eviscerate  that whole theme out of the movie. Disney might show two second clip of men holding hands that they can easily censor out from China, while still having a talking point to claim they did something brave and controversial. But they won’t include an entire theme that is completely antithetical to Chinese communism, that’s exactly why Mulan sucked so bad."
"If it were just to keep the copyright going, they could just as easily make a 30 minute holiday special for 1/50th of the cost and be done with it."
"Princess and the frog is a great movie.  I only saw it for the first time recently.  I had never heard it recommended and there are a lot of those movies I haven’t seen, especially the ones between when I was a kid and when I had kids.  Princess and the frog was a really good one.  Loved Tiana.  She had a great message about hard work.  How is there not a Tiana’s place/palace restaurant at Disney World?  Like with an animatronic gator playing the trumpet, fireflies lighting up on the ceiling, and awesome Cajun food."
"Is that home public domain works? (I realize I can look it up, but let’s interact!) if you own a property and dont do anything with it for an amount of time?"
They could have saved everyone time and energy and just did Tiana. And it should be cheap compared to the others. But most def remove the forg thing.
"Mulan cost 200 million to make and brought in 100 million. 

I didn’t even watch it, but to say it’s a “low effort” cash grab is far from the truth."
"I think you mean ""undah da sea"""
"No, but they did swap Scuttle.  She's a diving bird instead of a male seagull.  I wonder how many will complain about that."
The original comment was about why there was so many dislikes. Most of the comments here are saying its because everyone who disliked the trailer was racist. I disliked the trailer because it’s seems they are making the same mistake they did with Mulan.
"It's a remake of an old film, what could there possibly be to spoil?"
"Come on, you know that you want Flounder to be exactly the same character, except an actual flounder...it'd be hilarious."
"I just want more 2D animation, but I'm not getting that one back."
"Wish I could upvote this more than once. All of the ones you named are straight fire. Then again, I also wish Disney hadn't divested themselves of 2D animation entirely also, but Disney seems to prefer 'safer' cash grabs. Not even new, really: 20ish years ago the running gag was all of the low quality sequels they were churning out. Mulan is one of my favorite movies of all time and I refuse to watch Mulan II. The original stands on its own."
"I want all of those movies you mentioned but inexplicably race swapped.

Make Coco Swedish. Moana can be Irish. Mulan is now Haitian. Aladdin can be Slavic."
Don't forget Turning Red!
I love the unique idea movies. The problem is you can’t even criticize them when you bait them with social politics when they have problems. I got yelled at so much for saying Encantos plot kind of sucked because “this is alll about my culture and you just don’t understand”. Same with Black Panther.  I think it was very mediocre but apparently saying anything less than it is the best marvel movie is sin worthy. It feels like you can’t just enjoy a movie without people getting defensive with identity politics.
"they’re are still doing that at the same time… see turning red, encanto"
"Extra bonus: if we want diversity, let's have actual movies about cultures and settings that are rarely explored, noy just cheap race swaps"
Interesting that the majority of stand out examples of representation in Disney animation are coming from Pixar
I mean outta 7 2 of them had to get curious?
Political ideology they’re happy to abandon at the slightest hint of profit. Their virtue signaling here in the US doesn’t carry over to the overtly racist countries like China.
"Yeah, and that ideology is preservation of capitalism at all costs. And literally nothing to do with anything your dumb ass probably thinks."
"The thing you think is political ideology is what is called ""pandering for money"". Disney's decisions are 100% based on where the most cash can be collected for the lowest cost."
"I think they should make more movies like Miracle and Secretariat - movies about interesting historical events that are also family friendly. I know there aren’t too many honest shining moments in our history, but if they could find something, I bet it’d do really well right now. Lot of people looking for a reason to feel good about their country lately."
"A lot of their classic movies are retreads of existing tales.

Man, what really gets me is how damned classic the cartoons and songs are ... and just how forgettable the live action movies are.

There is NO cultural impact from any of the live action movies.

The only reason we watch these live action movies are to sing along with the classic songs we know but we'll forget them and Disney's probably going to try to remake them again."
"Coco, Encanto, Zootopia, Soul, Luca, etc. …it’s not like Disney has stopped turning out original hits."
"I listen to 3 different podcasts covering legends, mythology, and fairy tales. At this point the stories I hadn't heard before probably number in the hundreds from cultures around the globe. Most of them would make a compelling live action or animated film."
"There are a shit ton of legends, myths and fairy tales. There is also countless of very interesting european history stories that never have been told and I dont understand why. 

You dont even have to invent a new story, just adapt history in a accurate way. But no, the same shit stories need to be made with gender/race swaps just to piss off existing fans."
"They wanna play safe and not take a risk. We're in capitalism end stage where theres no need/want for innovation, but constant demand of profit at least cost and least risk"
Yes. Most movies follow one of like 4 Shakespere plays in terms of story format.
"“Do you have a money for me?”

“Yes, sir, I do!”"
"1) It takes more effort to come up with something new, original and good. 2) It is harder to make people invest in new IPs than in the ones that are already popular. Big companies always try to maximize efficiency and reduce risks which is why we end up with sterile safe choices. Yet we still get interesting original films. There are few diamonds in a pile of cash-grab junk just like it always was."
Haaaaaam!
"The Polish film ""The Lure"" is a pretty wild, and great, sort-of adaptation."
"> What if we did Aladdin from Jasmine’s perspective? Or better yet Genie’s? What if instead we followed Genie on his previous wish stint and see how his lamp ends up in Aladdin’s hands? And then the sequel was “Aladdin” but from Genie’s perspective?

I would watch full-length historically accurate Aladdin https://youtu.be/OFBYtwcm9Dw
"Correct me if I’m wrong, but a similar thing happened with that third Ghostbusters movie, where it was straight trash, but because of a small group disliking it because of the woman cast, it was used as a scapegoat."
"Why is righting some wrongs worse, in your opinion?

I like the trend of recognizing we're a pretty fucked up culture with respect to race, and doing something actively about, rather than behaving as if the acknowledgement is enough ( because so many won't even do that). Doing something about it is the next step."
"Ugh. That one is my least favorite. It worked as traditional animation, because cartoon animals have facial expressions. The CGI one was like sticking dialog over creatively edited Wild Kingdom."
"I was 17 when that version came out, and there was absolutely racist backlash.  Social media didn’t exist in 1997, so it wasn’t as in your face, but I remember people losing their shit about it, and negatively comparing it to the Lesley Ann Warren version from the 60s."
"I wouldn't call you racist because you pointed out what you don't like such as shitty cgi. But people that say ""this sucks, black elves"" are going to be called racist for their superficial take on the whole series."
And ghostbusters 2016. Movie was garbage but yet we were sexist for not liking it.
"Then come up with a uniquely ""different"" story, that stars a black girl... instead of ""rebooting"" a story, and changing the color of the character, and pretending that its inclusion: and not just fake controversy/ cash grabbing... if you and your children are so shallow, that you need to see your ethnicity represented in a disney cartoon, then maybe you should pick up a history book... or read about your origin....
Vs giving kids these misanthropic views of how ariel can either be white, or black: and that inherently means that she is better or worse; solely based on her skin color"
"Pretty much as well as cashing in the trend of sequels. I didn’t watch any, because at that point I was 25 not obsessing what Disney was doing as a corporation. 

This is the problem with these overly passionate emotionally stunted adults. They think it was only made for them."
I liked the new lion king. I felt like it was almost a shot for shot remake. It’s really not too far off. Pretty solid imo. And gambino and Beyoncé killed that duet
TIL. I’m not a fan. I didn’t know.

"It's their way of telling you that you're mentally ill, I get it a lot as a trans woman. Every single one gets a report and I get a response a few hours later saying action was taken against the account. Which is why I don't choose to block them.

And step aside and think about that one for a bit. They're the ones claiming that you're mentally ill while using an automated suicide prevention message to harass you. Hmm... Methinks they doth protest too much."
It’s not even there to help anyone.  It’s there so Reddit can say they tried and they super care.
Definitely. A while ago I was actually suicidal and posted about it. Only DMs I got were to film it and send it to them.
I wonder if it ever still ended up helping someone trolled by it. Stands to reason someone suicidal ended up getting a random one.
"The rule might exist, I suppose. I don't think anyone is enforcing it. If they were, they'd just do an easy human check on the users who send huge numbers of those. Oh, was there no reason? Fascinating!"

"I mean these are the same people that giggle like crazy at “Let’s Go Brandon” as some meta inside joke that they are the only ones that know how to decipher

National Treasure sycophants gone awry"
It’s just another troll
Because they are idiots.
"Her hair is a little muted, but I thought her fluke looked really good, and I hope they keep it in the movie."
"I’m pretty sure I read an article about how muted the colors were for live action beauty & the beast (which I couldn’t get all the way through a single watch of). I don’t remember the exact reason for the dullness in color from what viewers remember as particularly vibrant and overall gorgeous bright scenes from the animated versions, but I’m sure it’s something to do with saving money, I’m sure we can’t expect a conglomerate like Disney to invest and put money in their productions in the right places though."
"Yes, I saw the fluke"
Who gives a flying fuck about the hair either. She’s a fish. She should probably be bald.
"I will not be silent when it comes to my complaint about her skin color.

That complaint:  It should be darker."
Maybe Disney should issue a list of things people are allowed to complain about. Thinking for yourself is just too hard and dangerous.
What’s the difference lol
Sonic was animated.
"I think that’s all it is honestly. Saving money on production costs… if it looks like crap though, why would anyone watch it? They’ve already shot them selves in the foot by proving that something can look great, but still not be watchable, so maybe they might catch on someday to pay attention not just to how something looks, but the quality of the script - like maybe not repeating line for line the words from the originals minus any of the clever parts, the acting (don’t have your actors tone of voice sound as if they’d rather be dead than in your movie), the songs- if you’re going to do a repeat or an original, you’re really going to have to have an amazing musical team on that, and I don’t mean Beyoncé. 

Yes, she has a great voice, no one’s disputing that, but her score in the lion king fell very flat in my opinion, nothing memorable about it, nothing about that film felt like anyone even wanted to *be* there. 
Well I’ll give them props for one thing- it was unique in how bizarre and heartless the entire thing was. 

Maybe it’s a subtle nod to how depressing the times we live in are. After all, we’re supposed to be so technologically advanced and have such easy lives now- ha ha. Honestly, I saw more than adequate technology come out of the 90’s and it seemed like a pretty good stopping point in terms of how much public access we needed for a better life balance between technology and real-life. But of course humanity never learns, and things never stop progressing… I just don’t see much of anything progressing in the right direction. Not the things that really matter, not to me anyway."
That is horrible. Especially when you try to watch something midday and you can't see shit cause of the light from the sun
"> seems to be literally dark

*Battle of Winterfell intensifies*"
"I once read that to do big effects, the film basically needs to be done in black and white and the color added after. And there’s only one guy who knows how to do that, so we’re stuck with his preferred color palette."
"not night time necessarily, but she lives in a cave at the bottom of the ocean floor. If you've never been down that deep, it gets *real* dark. The deeper you go, less light penetrates the ocean, meaning colors desaturate and less vibrant. And also it gets darker."
"It is not at night and it looks like shit. This trailer really worried me because everything looked murky, dark and BORING. In this scene Ariel is in her grotto reaching towards the beam of sun filling the space, grasps nothing, and falls back down to the bottom towards the sand. 

It represents how the mermaid world doesn't suit her, she longs for the human word and to walk in the sun, but she can't get there, it's out of her reach, and she's hurting. It's her 'I want' song. It's an emotional pinnacle of the film.

Her sitting on a dark rock to sing this is *terrible* film making and it's flagging that we're going to get another shit house lion king-esque remake."
Are they also shaped exactly like manatees? To the point that they are manatees?
This. This RIGHT HERE.
Wait I thought it was become immortal from eating the flesh of a mermaid
"Yeah, I thought we already covered this in Cabin in the Woods."
I would watch this version of the movie.
"Okay, it would be kind of amazing if they gave it the Hans Christian Andersen ending."
Sea Mammals are of course [famously light skinned](https://media.fisheries.noaa.gov/styles/original/s3/2022-05/Mud%20Keys%20Sperm%20Whale%20May_2022_Credit%20FWC.jpeg?itok=43v5w0JJ)
"Well then she shouldn't have eyes, so let's make THAT movie."
"I thought that too, then 5 secs later... wait its a fictional mermaid... can't expect science to correlate with a fictional voice.
But omg her voice. Its perfect."
"I feel like they should be like penguins, great whites or orcas: black on top and at the bottom white to truelly be hidden."
"I really wish these people would have that single 'oh, I'm really fucking stupid' moment when they get simple things pointed out to them.

Like... Eskimos have dark skin, live in a sun deprived area, and all because they eat fish."
"I’ve seen that trotted around these Reddit threads too. Real jordan Peterson types, lol. I always hit back with “well… Poseidon is Greek so obviously they should at least have dark hair and eyes…”"
"My neighbor is a very black dude and is even more of an indoor type than I am. We both pretty much never see the sun. I am luminescent white and he's invisible with the lights out black. So it apparently doesn't matter how much sun you see to have a specific skin colour. Could of course be a racial ancestor thing, but mermaids can have racial ancestors too right?"
I’m trying to think of a white fish… ?
Mira grants The deep mermaids were pretty vicious. I bet these chuckleheads will.still prob try to have sex with them.
"Um, we'll, actually,.,."
They should just have manatees play all the merpeople because that's what inspired legends of mermaids in the first place
"If we really want to be “accurate”, all the mermaids should just be manatees"
Ahem. In the documentary of Peter Pan the mermaids sun on rocks. They could easily be tan if they chose to be.
"LOL, I predicted that nonsense right after seeing the trailer.

Always gotta back up their nonsense with made up science. They’re very smart, you know."
"iirc, it was modelled after female shark genitals, so it's as atomically correct as any mermaid genitalia would be."
"Why’d ya spill yer beans, Disney!"
That was William Dafoe.
Oh stop making sense already! S/
Color grading exists
"Oh right, because this movie is all practical effects and no use of computer enhancements"
I'd like to see that movie sounds twisted.
"I remember reading that in English class. I like looking at the original version of Disney films, like how Snow White was _seven_ in one version. Glad they changed that."
Logan treatment of The Little Mermaid. Dark and gritty. Ariel gets addicted to drugs and overdoses.
Some Hans Christian Andersen stories done accurately could be really good. I've always thought the Snow Queen would be a good one.
Tell her Malcolm X had red hair because he did
"It works both ways. I think the human parts of the Aladin film were better than the original in a lot of ways. They kind of brought, if not realism, at least a little more humanity to the main characters. On the other hand,  I thought genie and Jafar, both are whom are larger than life, were not well served by not being cartoons."
"""Stop making it all about race.""

""The actress was the best candidate for the role.""

I dunno, what else do you dumdum racists say, uhh, ""Why isn't there a mermaid pride month?"""
Maybe you just a racist. Why do people have a problem with fiction representing a diverse culture. No one was up in arms about white folks playing fictional black/brown characters.
">Disney is using the live adaption to stir the pot using racial controversy as that's the latest trend

Disney isn't sparking racial controversy, racist people are. There's legitimately no logical reason to be mad at this"
"Black people are not a ""trend."""
"Disney isn't responsible for the howling gibbering of insecure racists.

The pot stirring is being done by the racists. Nobody else."
"I'm sorry, is the kingdom under the sea an Aryan nation?"
"Someone’s skin tone can affect your perception of their hair. I’m tan and I grow orange hairs in my beard, but because of my complexion they look brown.

Look at the third pic. Zoom in on the hair above his head. If you took one of those strands of hair, it would be orange."
"Googling seems to confirm he had red hair, though It also seems to be reported that he hated his red hair due to the circumstances of where he got it, so maybe he tried to hide it in all photos?"
3rd pic clearly shows orange-tone hair
"I’m surprised you spent all that time looking for pictures but never searched, “Malcolm x natural hair color” or “did Malcolm x have red hair”.

I’m also surprised that he did have red hair and just dyed it."
Yep there are full black people in Africa with red or blonde hair that aren’t fully albino. I have seen it too and always assumed that it was some form of a mutation and popped up every now and then.
When he lived in New York he gained the nickname Detroit Red because of his hair.
"There’s a lobster with a Jamaican accent, clearly cannon from the original 1837 Danish story.  Also, in the original story, the little mermaid doesn’t have a name, the prince NEVER loves her, and in lieu of stabbing him after he marries a different women in order to revert back to a mermaid, she lets it go and becomes some other type of magical being.  Nothing at all like Disneys version."
It's almost like all this time it wasn't about faithfulness to the original
"Can you tell me the skin colour in the original story? Because thats pretty much one of the little details that are mentioned yet they are changed anyways. 

Why not just make up a complete different story i stead of bastardising and existing one?"
">The author of the original story doesn't say what her hair color is and she doesn't even have a name

No, but he did describe the little mermaid's skin as ""pale"".

*She saw her sisters rising out of the flood: they were as pale as herself*"
"Surely you understand that the people complaining are fans of the original Disney films tho, and not of a 19th century fairy tale?"
"It's interesting how sometimes producers of movies change and add things. Like, in the original movie from the novel of Dracula, it was the producer that added the thing, that vampires can't deal with sunlight. This was never in any myth and old tale, never mentioned in any sources, but it became basically the official lore about these fictional creatures.

And so, with the creation of ~~Heinrich Himmler~~ Ariel as first mermaid in visual design, it defined the basics of what we think of it now today.

If the first designs would have included three heads, a rocket launcher that shoots tiny african warlords at enemies and the bottom row as a tanks track chassis on the ocean surface, our image would be very different of it."
I mean I didn’t see any gills so I’m out.
"Because the original Disney movie was a loose adaptation of the story, while this movie is a remake of that original movie. People are calling these ""new details"" bullshit because it's not faithful to thing it's trying to remake."
Darth Vader
"No, it's straight up racism this time around. What do people have a problem with? **That a fictional character from the fictional underwater kingdom of Atlantis (or whatever) has dark skin.**



The semantics and posturing over the several different iterations of how the story was told is intentionally obfuscational. The story has gone over several fucking transitions. In the original iteration, her skin and hair color are never specified. Racists are using the Disney-fied version of this character as a shield. Good God people, get over the fact that characters can be black."
Delonte West
I think because they used to dye it or lighten it to that color. In the beginning of the movie they’re doing it at a barber shop and screaming because it apparently burns like hell.
Will Smith and Robin Williams were both blue?
But somehow having normal body proportions is okay and understood that will change from a literal cartoon to live action. People have a problem with her being Black and a lot of those people are using the hair argument as a shield to hide behind.
I just got one again so I'm definitely gonna report now
"She is very good, I just didn’t feel like it was Arial singing. Or like that isn’t how I’d imagine her singing the song that way, that was more like how’d you’d expect a singer to do it"
"And he was a naturally born merman, so much for realism"
"ha that's really cool, there are a few problems with the article like claiming very few black people don't have a mixed heritage (the entire continent of Africa would like a word with you) but reufues type albinism does seem to be a real thing.

pretty cool."
"I don't think Haley Bailey qualifies as having albinism.

I wouldn't mind if she had brought red/orange hair because she's a mythical creature, but it looks more like she's had a really shit dye job"
Theres also a Peter Pan movie that shows his origin that was pretty good. Peter and the lost boys were a street gang of pickpockets working for a disgraced socialite - Hook.
Rufio! Rufio!
Do you think this rendition of little mermaid will be as good to this generation as Hook was to gen-x?
Amen. Here’s $5 go see a Minion.
They 100 percent are.
">Kids are most certainly not the target audience

Well, they are a sizable part of the target audience.  I mean, who else is this for, apart from a smallish audience of Disney completists and nostalgia tragics?"
This is the best thing I’ve seen all day.
"Omg, a corporation made a business decision. How unthinkable."
Especially the lion king. Yuck what was that. After that I never watched live Disney movies.
"The Jungle Book was amazing because of the CGI. I was dumbstruck staring at the King Louie segment. I couldn’t tell if they got a real orangutan or not. The last time I was dumbstruck by film was when the T-Rex stepped out of its paddock in Jurassic Park. 

After that, the live actions just plummeted."
"That may be true for you, but the amount of hate this movie is getting is CLEARLY because of race.

I am also tired of the remakes, so I was initially going to stay away from them altogether. However the amount of ""Ariel isn't black"" really bothers me."
I rather liked Maleficent.
"I loved the 2016 Cinderella so much and no one ever mentions it. Was the first of the full feature live action remakes. Lily James was so perfect, it was a beautiful adaption and deserves some credit!"
Don't you mean equitably?
"Yeah, but now you are a racist."
Hey Cinderella is good
Same here! I also hate musicals! As a black dude though I’m going to see this movie in theaters out of spite because man the racist are coming hard at this movie.
"didn't watch it, but apparently Aladdin was quite good."
Cinderella was the best imo. That was done really well.
Cinderella was pretty good because it actually added onto the story in a good way
Except Pirates of the Caribbean?
"This, they’ve all been total crap. This one and Pinocchio will be no different, even after Disney tries to spin this “most views” angle as a positive. They’re the enemy and are making these casting choices to be intentionally abrasive and bring attention to soulless remakes that are guaranteed to suck."
"Agreed. At best, they're fine but less good than the originals. And at worse, they butcher the originals. There's no artistic reason to make them besides earning easy money from the disney crowd that thinks animation is only for kids."
"The thing I hate the most about Disney live action adaptations is that they completely change original plot and when it doesn't work they call the fans racist. 

JUST STICK TO THE ORIGINAL PLOTS DISNEY! THE WORK IS ALREADY DONE."
You don't have to download an extension to dislike it. That's for seeing the number of dislikes.

"And they’re hiding behind the predictable schedule of complaints to make it sound like they’re not racist but the fact that they start foaming at the mouth for every black woman on screen, they’re racist. They’re a bunch of fucking racists and guess what non-racists: you should be extremely pissed off at racists too! Because they’re using your words to hide their racism so they’re blending in with you, making you all look racist.

Maybe, just maybe, if this wasn’t an issue about racism, the actor wouldn’t receive a single racist DM. But they do. Fuck racists. Fuck these stupid, hillbilly, negative IQ fucking morons. Fuck these inbred mouth breathing 4 Chan dwelling racist cum stains."

"Bait what though? This only matters to people who value a singing mermaids whiteness enough to /checks notes

"I really think that doing stuff like this is a way for them to shield themselves from valid criticism, and you can basically trace that back to the Ghostbusters 2016 movie.

I watched it and honestly it was just bad. Like just really bad. And the critical reviews for were it were all pretty positive, especially when it first released. And I suspect a lot of that was they were afraid of being accused of sexism because of the shitshow was playing out on the internet.

I dont think that went unnoticed by the movie studios. 

Fast forward to today and there are so many movies with some little controversial nugget in them, and each has the same narrative: this movie is only getting panned because neckbeards are upset about <thing>.

Just in the past couple months: Lightyear with the same sex kiss: a boring movie nobody wanted is only getting bad reviews from fans because they are homophobic. Rings of Power: bad writing (why do rocks sink but not boats? wtf was this speech?!) and getting a lot of stuff totally wrong lorewise. Bad reviews are all review bombs from racists upset about our black elf tho. 

And what is actually really annoying about this is with things like the lightyear kiss: they pat themselves on the back for being so inclusive and then they simply edit it out when they release it into markets like china. Cowards."
"It would be a shit thing to do because white people ALREADY HAVE A TON OF CHARACTERS THAT ARE WHITE!!!  White people do not need another white character.  BIPOC need another character.  More inclusion. More representation.  Don’t tell me you haven’t seen the HUNDREDS of “first reaction” videos of little black girls getting so excited over Ariel being a black girl.  And if you don’t have feelings that that’s important, then you can’t be helped, and should thus be ignored."
"Expected replies: blah blah blah white kids' time is over, blah blah blah they have enough material already, blah blah blah"
Danish. Not Dutch.
"Honestly that’s kind of the direction I think Disney should go again.  More experimental rather than retreading old ground they (plagiarized/stole) borrowed from sourced material, but in live action this time rather than animated."
Unlike us devout worshipers of the Little Mermaid who know every scene backwards
It’s not just Disney movies. Have you seen what people are saying about Rings of Power?
"You prob aren’t the demographic and it’s easier to market IP that parents and kids already know and grew up with. Little mermaid had 2-3 animated sequels that bombed. Same with Cinderella, Lion King, and Pocahontas. It’s just easier to build on old than market something brand new (like Encanto)"
"... My god... realizing Sonic the Hedgehog is handling live action adaptations better than Disney. Like... the sonic movies aren't award-winning, but you can tell they aren't trying to be either. It's kinda the charm.

This timeline is so confusing..."
"Ironically, the seafloor being that dark is legitimately the correct amount of light. The ocean is fucking dark and she lives in a friggin cave. There should be like 0 light sources from anywhere."
"Also, is it just me or do the water effects (especially at the last scene) look awfully cheap and empty? Aquaman looked a lot better in my opinion."
"I did and it's all just dumb jokes in the same format

apparently to make fun of Disney astroturfing the comment section with generic, templated praise"
"Yeah, I know but hope springs eternal."
"More likely someone found a way to hack, A good hacker could write code to spam likes or dislikes from faux accounts"
Nope anyone who disagrees with me is racist
Well thanks for that visual
"you do you, but i'm waiting for transparent skin, bioluminescence, and a second set of jaws that can extend from the back of her throat when feeding.  

still the same voice tho"
"Long bioluminescent hair might be advantageous though, a fish seeking food and shelter could easily get caught in it.

***GASP!***   jellyfish hair."
Explodes from lack of pressure during her transition into becoming human.
So you want Tim Burton's version of The Little Mermaid. I am also down with this.
Now that would be an exciting direction to go for a remake.
Lol me and my wife were joking they should have made them all look like uncle Ugo from Luca!
"YES!!! Precisely, someone other than me gives a goddamn about SCIENTIFIC ACCURACY. Make her look like one of those SNL mermaids (the ugly ones)"
Yesss like the uncle from Luca
Those things in the Aquaman movie?
"This is roughly the argument I've been forwarding.

Ariel is ""really"" white? Well, no, she's really *fictional*. Mythological, in fact. There IS no color she ""is"".

The story is Danish? Well ok, it was written by a Dane, but unless there are actually mermaids in Denmark, Ariel isn't Danish, she's *a mermaid*.

Is *pink* the right color for a mermaid's skin? Seems to me like a mermaid ""really"" ought to be green. Or maybe silvery like a dolphin. What if Disney whitewashed her last time? 

If after all this it still really matters to somebody that this particular fictional non-human mythical creature is ""really"" white, then that's their own hangup, almost certainly based in a social attitude that they'll probably lose your mind if I name right out loud.

EDIT: Also ""I'm just against these live action remakes"". Okay. The pretty white wizard girl played Belle. Did you protest that? If not, what could *possibly* be different about this film and its casting decisions?"
This is probably very close to our interpretation of mermaids in Africa. They are associated with witchcraft and are supposed to look creepy.
We need a lovecraft - little mermaid crossover. Little mermaid sacrificing to Azatoth.
"Don't forget the butchering and devouring of sailors alive, as per the original myth.

Come to think of it, the Little Mermaid should have been an horror movie set on an underwater facility (like the on on The Abyss)."
"The story the movie is based on is yes, but there are lots of folk and fairly tails about mermaids all over Africa. Lots of different cultures countries have their own distinct myths about them all over the continent. 

But yeah, this is just in line with every butthurt comment when a character who is expected to be white isn’t."
"Yes they were in Denmark
But did he travel to a reef in Europe?"
And where did the original people who made their way to Denmark come from?   You’re assuming the (fantasy creature) walked into the ocean and turned into a mermaid from modern day Denmark.
that’s exactly what the liberals want you to think.
You do know that means her skin color doesn’t matter but here we are lol
"Of course it does, why doesn't Ariel have gills?"
"Well it’s life action lol

Edit: live"
Well not really but representation does.
"So you’re using science to justify and erase cultures founded on reefs lol

I’m not using science for this; I’m using what kind of people naturally live there, their myths and legends lol."
"This person actually has a point, lol"
so why aren't all fish and sea mammals white then?
So you want her hairless with lots of bodyfat to keep her warm and gills aswell?
"But regions with coral reefs and their native indigenous populations are not light skinned.

Yet reefs play a vital role to them; why not give them this."
I go even further and say “You’re worshiping a God of the Middle East”
I can’t wait to have a Jesus live action movie equivalent to Thor where the Virgin Mary is played by Melissa McCarthy
"But the thing is; this ISNT the cartoon
But even if it’s based off it; there are countless children who will be happy to see a character like them and that’s all that matters.

Representation is important but must be done right.

I’d probably give this a 7/10 though."
"It's a  community that keeps getting larger due to things like the YouTube algorithm. Bunch of ""content creators"" found out that this type of veiled racism and misogyny gets then lots of clicks. Then they organize on places like 4chan to brigade the rating of these media"
">They really did just ignore a lot of the established lore. 

The lore that everybody is worried about concerns the skin colour of fantasy characters.  

Everything else is largely cover.  Plausible deniability is the racist's best friend."
"Yeah, nobody is worried about the people criticizing the show for, say, some trivial plot detail. They are worried at the people criticizing it for having a character with black skin. *Those* are the people the guy you responded to was talking about. Not sure why you'd think otherwise."
"They ignored a bunch of lore and compressed timelines which is understandable criticism of the storytelling and writing choices. Having a few black guys on screen isn’t a valid criticism. The color of a characters skin has never been relevant to tolkiens work beyond providing a description of them. 

Same with a black mermaid. It’s just a fairy tale about a fictional being. The story and music is what’s important when judging as a form of media, not the casting choices."
"There are degrees of racism. If some sad sack is bothered by black people simply being depicted in Middle Earth, and go on diatribes about it on the internet, that doesn't necessarily make them hood wearing klansters but I would say it certainly makes them racist."
Exactly. Nobody gave a fuck about non Caucasian people in game of thrones.
"> People can dislike a show without being racist.

But see Amazon has pushed the idea that anyone who doesn't like it only dislikes it because they are secretly racist. And now even posting this comment has made others think ""this guy must be secretly racist"". The fact is there is another fantasy show on *right* now with a very similar fanbase to LotR and also cast several roles with black actors and it isn't getting ""review bombed by racists"", and I'm talking about House of the Dragon. Why are we not reading all these stories about that show as well? I'll tell you why. Because it's actually good. And yes there are idiot racists online who made disparaging comments about that show casting black actors but guess what that number of people wasn't enough to cause a ""review bomb"". And don't tell me ""well LotR is bigger than GoT"" because HotD is getting double the viewership that Ring of Power is. I'll get downvoted for just pointing out the truth of this matter. Maybe this shit ain't actually getting review bombed and maybe people are just hating on shitty shows. And maybe just maybe corporations are trying to push the racism narrative because they know it will drum up some line of support for their shitty product regardless of it's quality. Hell it's worked before."
"Perhaps it would be good to consider that the common element in reviews of ROP is it's boring and the dialog is simply dreadful. Some slow burns fizzle out..

I could care less about one black Harfoot, one black elf, and so forth. Seems like a ginned up element for a studio to cry ""racism is why we're getting slagged in reviews!"". Same one trick pony as Ghostbusters 2016.

Cheers"
"Isnt Amazon basically limited to using like an appendix worth of lore? 

Seems like they’re doing a pretty decent job to me with what they’re allowed to work with for source material.

Like I was a pretty big LOTR fan and I still really like the show. 

Now if we were talking about WoT…. Well shit they seem to have thrown out 80% of the story and they’ve got full reign of it"
"The fact that you say you’re not racist just let’s everyone know that you are, because you clearly have not taken a look at yourself long enough to notice that you are, in fact, much more racist than you think."
"The thing that pisses me off is the characters in middle earth are famously racists. Against other races (elf, dwarf, etc). But they don’t care about doing color?"
"""the only valid criticism comes from me, everyone else is just a lacist"""
"LOTR is a made up fantasy world, ffs.  How do y'all still keep using this dumbass argument?"
"Those characters are intrinsically tied to their race, though. Like the whole story is about it. The Little Mermaid isn't tied to being white, it's tied to her being a mermaid. Like if you take Shang-Chi as a random example, his story is tied to his culture and is a part of the plot. If you were to replace Akwafina's character (also asian, obviously) with a white person, then it changes nothing."
"They already whitewash plenty of characters. Ghost in the Shell, Gods of Egypt, Speed Racer, Aloha… what’s your point?"
">Why am I not seeing stories being promoted about how all the fans of that show are racist too?

Because 

1 - you're not paying attention and/or are terrible at recognizing racism

and 

2 - the bigots have simply been less successful on that front.  Harder to use plausible deniability of 'we just care about lore accuracy' when GRRM is an executive producer on the show.  They've definitely been trying, though."
"> That show took an all white fantasy cast and put black actors into some of its most prominent roles.

It was previously established that the people from the Summer Isles are black, and some Valyrian lines being black doesn't contradict anything established, either. A stretch? Possibly, but meh fucking meh."
"LOL. Representation matters is a thing because there are a limited number of non-white superheroes/protagonists, heroes/leads portrayed in American media. White children are not starving for characters who look like them in popular culture, what are you even talking about?"
"That doesn't answer my question. The casting call should be definite with ""White Caucasian women"" plus the age, and other defining characteristics. Hair color can be dyed so no problems there. Plus we've seen Disney's other live action heroines. Talent is the last thing they have."
The people who changed the skin colour. They give a fuck. Don't try to twist this around. Giving these losers an inch only makes them take it a mile.
"https://images.app.goo.gl/W79dg6YHfY3GJK1bA

Actually probably disneys logic. Advantage of making everything “realistic” is that you don’t have to take artistic risk."
"As a former kid, kids are damn stupid."
"I'm just afraid that the type of thinking you're doing will be the same for the Disney folk, and they'll keep trying to make movies targeting children (instead of providing enjoyable movies that adults still love after they've grown up). It's not difficult for a company like Disney to make a child-pleaser with their multimillion dollar budget, but clearly they don't care enough to make a movie that's enjoyable for decades like before."
"Exactly. My son loves the live action Aladdin, I can’t get him to watch the original at all."
"It is for kids, but also live actions movies are for people who want to see the movies they grew up come to life. I think Disney appeals to both demographics."
"Considering the recent trend of people being mad about black elves and people vocally being mad about a black mermaid… yes?

Like there are people in this thread complaining about the race swap."
Are you willfully ignoring the loud and clear racists? Lmao
I didn't watch the trailer. It came up on my feed. Just have a down vote just to express my dislike for the movies existence.
"Not only did they do my man Ackbar dirty, but they ruined a good ending for Leia. I thought that was a good ending to her character only to have her fly through space. And don’t get me started on all the other issues I have with that movie"
"All of those movies are better than nothing, but all of them are about, or include ""Asians being Asian"" as a plot point. What I mean by that is for the most part, white and black characters are commonly allowed to exist merely as people whose viewpoints and experiences aren't mediated by their race. Indiana Jones just wants to fuck over the Nazis. Blade just wants to kill vampires. Nothing to do with their race. No flashbacks to Germany or Nigeria. Asians don't generally get that treatment, and writers feel the need to drop all sorts of ""This is what life is like as an Asian"" treats in there for everyone."
"Classic

I was too lazy to find it so thanks"
"Snow White is going to be Latina.

Edit -Downvote this all you like, but Rachel Zegler is cast and currently in production making Snow White, she is Colombian.

https://variety.com/2022/film/news/snow-white-remake-rachel-zegler-disney-1235363620/"
You think it would be worse than this?
Isn't that pretty much every lead though?
"Does that negate the character Angel from the movie NOPE? He’s a tech nerd/geek in the story, but he was so good in that role. Not to mention, he was insanely tasty to the eyes."
Tv show.  But Eddie and Louis from Fresh off the Boat
"Agreed. I also think someone like you saying ""initially I felt a way because of X because of my experience"" is very different from the majority of these white dudes who you know didn't give 2 shits about a cartoon mermaid a month ago."
"That's the part that I really don't care for. So many vibrant African cultures yet Disney can't create a story celebrating those people. 

They'd rather just shoehorn a black person in a already told story. 

Comes across fake as fuck."
"I mean, the Little Mermaid was always about love transcending racial barriers, and the sheer amount of people who obviously missed that point shows that casting a black woman as Ariel is *probably needed*."
"So many live action remakes have been lazy but I have to say, I do think Aladdin has been the worst culprit so far in the Princess remakes. I don’t think there’s causation there but I do think Cinderella and Beauty in the Beast came across as having put more effort in. But I don’t think that’s because of race, that movie was just a mess imo."
How the fuck was that the point of the little mermaid. It was about her being shortsighted and taking her life for granted and then regretting the shit out of it.
The hate is so bad that someone edited her trailer by making her skin white.
"Sure, let's agree to disagree. They also had Annie amd willy wonka from the 70s. I'm just saying that some people won't get to have the experience you had based upon nothing but studios betting on us doing exactly what we are doing right now."
I’m a redhead American. We don’t get it better lol
Connor McGreggor voicing Sebastian legit sounds like a fun time
Just don't give the crab ginger hair or it automatically gets cast as a black person anyways.
"That's true. Famously Americans would capture crabs and trained them as butler for princesses and also teach them musical numbers. 

Its a dark part of history that few will took about but it needs to be told."
It really is just so blatantly racist
Ohh maybe they could get snow to voice the crab. He’s a white dude that sounds Jamaican.
"""Samuel E. Wright as Sebastian, a red Caribbean crab who serves as King Triton's advisor and court composer."""
"disney’s primary target market is 4-12 year olds

the most frequent users of Disney+ are also between 2-17 years old

you like kid’s stuff, it’s cool bro"
Yea so we are using albinoism as the standard for black people?
"Your taste isn't the same as a childs though. You think it's god awful, a child will think it's amazing."
because they're mammals? they have to go up to the surface world to breath
"Yeah I think dark top sides to match the depths when seen from above, and light bellies to match the light from above when seen from below is generally most common, right?"
"The movie is set in the age of sail, no cameras and sonar tracking yet I suppose.  If it was modern times we would have overfished them for mermaid sushi by now, absolutely."
">why is overrepresentation the solution here

Its bold to assume that white people are still not largely over represented in film and television"
"Why are you bringing up representation when the director has already said the actress was by far the best person for the role? She won this on merit, and isn’t that what y’all have always asked for?"
"I mean unironically, yes, [yes they do have racist bots.](https://qz.com/653084/microsofts-disastrous-tay-experiment-shows-the-hidden-dangers-of-ai/)"
"Sadly, robots learn [from people](https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/24/11297050/tay-microsoft-chatbot-racist), and people can be assholes."
I didnt even say everyone
Oh shit true I forgor about that lol
"Even anything approaching ""the majority"" of them, either."
I'd say that a 6.5' Scandinavian is far enough from a fairly nondescript Irish tailor that it still kinda works.  Though not as good as what they already did in the play.
You'll be back.
"My sister in Christ, I have to believe they were trolling you or I would straight up not be able to make sense of the world anymore."
They leave their houses to vote. That alone should give us all chills.
"You know how boring most musicals are? Jesus christ superstar is literally the only musical I've ever watched without being bored. Rent sucks, cats sucke, wicked sucks, etc etc. They're fucking cringe."
"I'm not familiar with In The Heights, but I'm fine with any casting if it allows the story to be told. Possibly a race-swapped retelling where whites are the minority? Like that one commercial where straight people were the minority and oppressed."
"Ah, I just assumed it was some kind of joke."
"Some of it is very Miranda-esque already.  Look at this rhyme scheme!

What would I give, if I could live, out of these waters

What would I pay, to spend a day, warm on the sand

Bet you on land, they understand, bet they don't reprimand their daughters

Bright Young women, sick of swimmin, ready to stand"
Of course but I can promise you I didn’t hear any of the kids complaining at school the next day or anytime there after which leads me to believe this is more an issue amongst the adults
Yes!!! And she was great too! I fail to see what the outrage is all about lol
"I keep picturing a mouth like one of the muppets - like Beaker or something. Just a mouth that flaps open and closed while he dances...omg they're gonna make him do modern dance moves too, aren't they. They're gonna make him dab."
Could be!
"It’s like making her hair blue. Sure it doesn’t change any of the story but it’s not faithful to the original and it wouldn’t make any sense for them to do it. when I get an adaptation I want it to be the same movie basically but brought to live action.

Edit:and a voice actor isn’t shown on screen , it couldn’t matter what he looks like or where he’s from because it’s just his voice that we’re getting from him."
I'm referring to the obvious top half of her
It’s about time!
How many 16 year olds who've never had voice lessons can pull off a technically polished melisma the way she did in the trailer?
"Worse part, 
It’s not even that the books were banned, the dr Seuss estate took them off publication, they are not banned, there is just not gonna be anymore made…"
"My favorite is the quasi scientific explanations ""Well uv light doesn't penetrate so they wouldn't be black""

"I always joked Racist mad because valyrians are black. ""All upset that black characters were taking their exclusivity to incest"""
"I honestly just can’t take the white hair seriously in the House of the Dragon. The white people, the black people - doesn’t matter the hair is fucking ridiculous lol"
Well in fairness Atlantis was one of the last few Aryan kingdoms. Changing that severely diminished their already limited spank banks.
"Uhh...what?  What do dildos on the original's cover have to do with the remake being less of a cash grab?  Am I missing something, here?"
My comment is more just playing devils advocate. The mindset of a lot of the critics not necessarily that there racist. But that there is a clear double standard for roles that are written as white characters when when its done for black characters it’s called white washing and would be called racist.
Literally not a single kid in the world will put that together. You’re just trying to excuse your racism and it’s fucking hilarious.
"I do agree quite a bit, especially about the newest Cruella movie. While I enjoyed a lot of it, I don’t like that they are trying to make her more misunderstood versus being an evil character."
Ok but singing is also like a major requirement
"You seem a bit heated? My comment doesn’t apply to everyone. My point is that SOME people say, “oh it’s not her skin color,” when they wouldn’t be caring or criticizing the movie had she been white. People will say anything to discredit an inclusive move without being “racist.” 

It’s directed towards babies and kids, It’s not trying to win an Oscar. I’m sure people will live bc her hair is not bright enough.

The main point of the conversation is that people are genuinely hating and finding reason to dislike the movie because the actress is black. You can’t deny that."
Ghostbusters 2016?  Yeah I’m gonna say 2016 was not a great year when those folks got riled up and then decided the US President for 4 years…
"But, will it make little girls happy?  Yes, it will.

It doesn't matter what their motives are.  Just let the girl be happy."
"So what if they do it for money? Marketing, toy sales, advertising has always been for money especially around Christmas time. Just imagine Christmas morning. “No Timmy we didn’t get you any presents because corporations sale trendy toys for money. They do it all for a profit so you can’t participate in their identity politics on Jesus’ birthday”"
Are danish people historically over represented?
Like what? A cultural figure being depicted by a different ethnicity?
"How would a change in skin tone have detracted from the story of Moana? Maui is a fictional god, what difference does his skin tone make?"
"Well, this is a case where it’s not a dog whistle so I have no issue using to to “take back” a common and syntactically correct arrangement of English words to not have racist undertones?"
I hope they told her what would happen. We have seen this before.
With a built in social media presence among young girls. The people the movie will *actually* be marketed to. Not crusty weebs
"OMG this. Emma Watson sure looked the part but the singing fell short. Nothing against her performance at all, the original score was just so good I can’t think anyone would(n’t) struggle. Will Smith had a similar issue with Genie, as nobody could hope to live up to standard Robin Williams set.

I agree with some of the criticisms around effects work for these movies and am usually cautiously optimistic when these trailers are released. No lie, this short clip of Halle Bailey singing brought me back to my childhood in a way only songs can and I’m genuinely looking forward to seeing it.

Edit: would to wouldn’t"
"Oh man I know...such a joke...she did an ok job as Belle but that role absolutely could have been done better by somebody else. And yeah, at least make it someone who can actually sing... it's only one of the most iconic disney movies there is."
"My two year old, who obviously has no context of the original, LIT UP when she came out of the cave and started singing.   They while scene brought such a joy to his face it was pretty incredible."
I cried so much too! The Little Mermaid was my favorite movie as a kid and hearing Halle singing was just jaw dropping. She's so beautiful and I'm so excited to hear her rendition of the songs
"According to the Disney website, official novelization and Disney-sanctioned reference material, Sebastian is a lobster. Controvery remains over Sebastian’s species due to Sebastian stating he himself is a crab, as well as Chef Louis indicating as such. In The Little Mermaid TV series, he is also referred to as a crab."
"There's a disproportionate amount of redheads in certain properties. Marvel for example. Only 1 percent of the world population is redheads though the US has around 3 percent. If 14 of your 42 characters are redheads, especially the women, I don't see anything wrong with branching out. And I say that as someone born with red hair whose favorite characters are often redheads."
"Really ???  

How many examples do you have of movie remakes where a red head was replaced with a black person…?

I’ll wait.

Your shit stinks because it’s apparent that “stat” was pulled out of your racist ass."
"As another redhead, odd they only care now that it’s about a the race of a mermaid and not when we are verbally abused, called slurs or straight up assaulted for our hair."
"How can your evidence be the same answer as your original statement.  

The answer I had in mind was none, because you have no idea how Black people or say, Asian people would react to *becoming* a minority. Does such a place exist right now?"
There's no such thing. It's just racism.
I’d actually be curious at what the representation ratio is in 2022 given the modern initiatives for it
There should be just as many Latino as Black actors.
Omg go fuck yourself.
"racists:  ""but what if we recasted a white guy to play Malcolm X?  the hypocrisy omg"""
why would it change the whole story ? wakanda isnt real. black panther isnt real. just make it about asian discrimination or something.
Oh… ***as a whole***.
Sorry I don’t get what that has to do with your original point.
Maybe they'll make climate change a plot point.
"If none exist, they can't be a minority, dear. Please stay consistent."
Thats not enough. Where are the south asians or middle eastern represantion?
"That's one problem, if you dislike it for a proper reason you'll probably still be labeled as a racist. Look at the Rings of power, it's basically a poorly written fan fiction, it doesn't look good, but most people who criticize it are labeled racist because there are black people in it and it's assumed they dislike it for that reason."
I knew it was sarcastic. I don’t understand why people care which race plays a role. They should be more upset that studios are making you pay for the same movie over and over again.
It kinda depends on their skin color don’t you think?
"Oh don’t worry, America heaped racism on Italians too for YEARS before finally deciding they were white only relatively recently."
">No it's just sad to see how some people have a total meltdown when the shoe is on the other foot.  They still fail to understand.

This is just inconsistent though. Ppl are complaining about Gal Gadot as Cleopatra. Are they being racist or anti-semitic?"
Can’t wait for Nicolas Cage as Blade.
Changing the race of Blade doesn't change the story at all.
"So, changing the race of Black Panther doesn’t change the story? 

Wanna know what folks would call it if a POC character was race swapped to a white person? Cultural appropriation…."
Some downvote out of  reaction because of what was said about other movies like Ghost in the Shell or others like it in the past.
"Idk maybe it’s cause I had a lot of theater kid friends we saw people of all races doing roles of classically white characters so it doesn’t seem like a big deal for me?? A movie I liked a lot when I was younger was the Cinderella movie with the black actress. Idk, it never made me upset?"
Well if we wanna go genetic do you know why their is not a lot of black swimmers concave and convex has something to do with it. Either the blood or body. Hence many black runners. Seriously I don't mind a black Ariel if she can sing and the movie isn't cliché woke then I am all for it. But look up stats about lack of black professional swimmers. That saying it's fantasy so anything is possible. It might make it real and at the end when she gets her legs from falling in love with her master (which the cartoon depicted him as a slave trader to a white ariel) she might go oh shiiit jump in the water to be a mermaid her convex blood screws her up and she drowns.
"Ffs this is the remake of the original animation not the original fairy tale. In the classic she is white and has red hair. Thats it. If an Asian or Hispanic or Indian gets casted, I still have the same issue. The argument is if Disney wants a remake of a classic, they should try to stick to the original context as much as possible, especially when she is the main character. Disliking the director casting Halle for the role doesnt mean we hate black people.
On another hand, Halle voice is magnificent and I hate that she gets involved in this stupid situation."
Correct. But Ariel DID have a race. So did all 6 of her sisters. Two of which were of Asian descent.
"K, I want Ryan Reynolds’s to play Blade. I don’t want to hear any complaining.

He’s fictional and he doesn’t come from Wakanda or Africa. He’s from Detroit. Anyone can be a vampire killing half-vampire from Detroit."
"So, would you have the same thoughts if they put a white person in the role of a well known Black character? Like, a white man playing Black Panther?"
Lmao oh god you're right. Clicking their profile tells you exactly who they are.
"Take the L, ur too low iq"
God forbid we add a black woman into a story about how as a woman if you don't completely abandon your old life and embrace your man's world you don't have a soul.
"You're imagining that. What is happening is a bunch of racist asshats are rushing out to attack a movie because they cast a black actress for the role. Most of the rest of us don't give a rats ass about a Disney movie, we just think racists should be shamed wherever, whenever, and as often as possible."
">Nope. Originally she has been portrayed white. She should remain white.

But she isn't gonna remain white so....cope?"
Bradley Cooper isn't even ivory.
Yesssssss! Thissssss
No it was the guy from the newer star wars movies. His name escapes me at the moment.
No?  I thought I saw picture of the new cast with him in it.
">Have you seen any of these young children's reactions? If not , look it up . If such a little thing makes children happy,  then who are we to fight about it

It's just teaching them narcissism."
I’ve heard the actress sing and heard her talk about the angle she took with the role and I genuinely think they picked her because she was the best one for the part. Also the director talked about the casting process in an interview and it sounded legit to me.
"Show me one example of this type of brigading happening to film reviews where the film doesn’t have prominent POC. I’ll wait.

P.S. I see you believe Trump won the election and are a vaccine denier. Sorry the education system failed you. Wish you the best going forward. It’s never too late to start learning."
"I can find some. 2 of my friends are republicans…they’re against trump being re-elected, states he lost fair and square, and only think abortion should be illegal during the third trimester unless something happens."
"My dad fits both those bills.  Hell, most of my family does.  
The Republican Party isn't exactly founded on those two ideas.  And believing that all Republicans follow the same political route nowadays is as dense as calling all Democrats ""Woke idiots"".  The world is a varied place.  All sorts of things can make someone call themselves a vague party description like ""Republican"".

I'd recommend taking some time to get to know people of another party, instead of seeing them as an enemy."
">No lol, I watch movies for entertainment, not to study for a PhD in history haha

Oh okay, so you don't get bothered like other ppl have about how Jesus was played by Jim Caviezel or how Gal Gadot is going to play Cleopatra. If someone can at least seem like Frederick Douglass, they should get the part. Total open casting. I get ya."
"The Little Mermaid, a fairy tale written by Danish author Hans Christian Andersen. Denmark is a very white country in Europe."
"I hate to break it to you, but today's racists, haters and trolls aren't going to matter when Disney, the cast and the crew are cashing tomorrow's royalty checks. 

If they do a great job it'll pay off in the long run regardless of what people like you think. With Halle on vocals and Lin-Manuel Miranda writing new songs for the film, the soundtrack alone is guaranteed to be a hit. Can't wait to buy my copy just based on the couple seconds featured in the trailer."
"The dislikes dont mean shit, have you seen how many people believe in a stolen election and a flat earth. There exists such thing as a crowd of idiots.

Im mexican, would i care if they cast speedy gonzales as a white or black person. No

But that wouldn’t make it the problem. The problem would be, how would the mice feel? Shouldnt the mouse community care that they arent being represented? No, theyre mice. Should the fish community be concerned? No. Ive looked it up, there is no such thing as a Caucasian redhaired fish"
"I’m a “weak minded fuck” for not caring if a mermaid is black? 

So that means you are a “strong minded fuck” for having a temper tantrum over “reeeee woke reeeeeee” yes so strong minded 

>	but keep projecting your insecurities miserable fuck

The hilarious part is you can’t see you’re the one projecting"
Where we you when they had brown haired Kristen Stewart play Snow White in a gritty action movie?
"So skin color matters, not just the content of the character?"
No she wasn’t.
How is it not???
"Lots of people slam Disney for the old bullshit they've done, it's just that...well...times change, and companies do too (mostly).  Stuff like Song of the South's influence is largely gone, and instead, the stuff they put out today is more relevant.

And don't double back on your statement.  You said an ""either or"" type statement.  Where if a female lead or a black lead is in a Disney movie, they'll be largely hated, which I detailed to be not true, even in the past."
There's so many black actors and actresses and popular shows and movies from decades back to present. Stop pretending that their careers aren't significant.
Then it’s not a continuity problem because there’s no continuity.
"Ok, but define woke?"
are you represented by characters of your same race?
"Fish skin is not the same as mammalian skin. It does not have the same density nor the same composition. https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/fish-skin
> Fish skin is formed by an external mucus layer, epidermis and dermis. In contrast to mammals, the dermis is entirely formed by live cells along with some mucous cells that produce the mucus.

Additionally, fish in the deep ocean are black because there is very little light where they live. Last I checked, Ariel isn’t a deep sea mermaid."
"Gonna have to agree with you there. There’s less risk I guess in just remaking a previous film, but with all the backlash from the trailer, only time will tell if it was worth the money"
"Nick Fury, the original one, was white, yes, but Nick Fury Jr. (aka the one most people are familiar with) has always been canonically black. This has been the case since the launch of the Ultimate Marvel comic series.

Also I was 2 at the time."
how many people do you personally know that would dislike this because they don’t like black people?  i don’t know anybody that would do that.
"The little mermaid 1989 is a kids movie, guarantee you a kid will have more interest in that than a live action remake"
"Yeah I don't think it's worth getting mad over, but it's pretty weird that they're doing it. Why not come up with a new idea/new character/new film, rather than changing established ones? To stir the pot, obviously, and it works. Every. Single. Time."
Sooooo you can’t accept that someone who looks like her can get a role simply because she was the best who auditioned?
So you would be ok if she were white doing the same thing?
"Thanks, Bill Gates."
and firefox
THIS IS RED ROCKS.  THIS IS THE EDGE.
"Thays because edge is chrome .
They gave up."
"People hate on it, but it works and doesn't eat my CPU."
And opera gx

Thanks! Didn’t know this was a thing.
I’m edging
Firefox?
So there’s one thing…
Jesus who figurs that out
That’s because Edge is Chrome. Go to FireFox where extensions work and your personal information is kept private.
Blue chrome
And Firefox of course.
"Which makes me wonder, why exactly were dislikes removed again?"
"I might be crazy, but I don’t think YouTube dislikes are representative of either honesty or democracy."
Now they have to make one with a Ginger Ariel
"But it’s completely dishonest. Millions of people didn’t dislike it, it used an algorithm to project how many people would have disliked it based on the users of the extension, who are obviously hateful assholes considering they felt such a powerful urge to see something denigrated they downloaded a chrome extension for it."
"How does seeing how much people disliked something help anyone or anybody? I'm indifferent on then getting rid of it because I literally can't think of a good answer to that question.

If people don't like something, it will show 0 likes, and that relays the message without dislikes."
Is brigading by racist jackasses a form of democracy?
Is that an American thing?
I think it uses the data from those with the extension along with some other data to make an educated guess on the approximate number of the real dislike count
"You can still dislike the video without the extension, it just doesn't show you the dislike count, which can be a bad thing because it's a lot harder to tell if something is actually worth your time or not, like with tutorial videos, if the video is full of inaccurate and useless info, you won't know that until after you've either wasted your time watching the video or after following the instructions in the video if you don't know that it contains bad info, which in one of the worst case scenarios, could result in serious injury or even the death of the person."
If that makes you feel better
They have a version with the same name: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/return-youtube-dislikes/
Somehow Dislikeatine has returned
"Somehow, the dislike returned."
Rocky XXIV: Dislike
Not another Jar-Jar Binks movie!!!
god i love when people get what im referencing xD
You misspelled THE CRIMSON FUCKER
"Short Paul, is that you?"
"""How did he get in here? We had guards outside!"""
"“Seras, our group relationship can best be summarized as tags on PornHub, now go…”"
Oooh that's interesting. I would bet though that the people who would download the extension are more likely nerdier and therefore more likely racist. So I hope maybe the ratio is slightly better in reality.
They are fishing for views and it’s looks to be working.
Being vague to distance them from the 1.5 million lol
Always hilarious to me how so many grown ass men on the internet will rant and rave about a movie they will never see and never care to see. My daughter is super excited to see it and could care less what Ariel’s skin color is.
Check your numbers again
Are ya sure now XD
It only knows the dislikes from people who have the add-on and guesses what the real dislike would be based on that. Problem is the people that have that add-on are not really a good distribution of the population. It most likely heavily male in a certain age range.
"Because every last device that could see the dislike ratio has been updated to not show it, how else would you be able to see it or even make an educated guess?"
Why do you think it’s pretty close though?
"The number of people who have this extension is laughably small and should not be taken into account at all, the videos that we have data as to how disliked they were is irrelevant to a brand new trailer"
">I tested it before on videos I have access to and it was over estimating by over 8x. A video with 100 dislikes for example this extension said 967. So it’s garbage.

One of the comments here. 

Bigger source like League of Legend spotlight channel has mentioned the similar thing in the past with their video having only like 100 dislikes but the extension showing like 500 dislikes"
"It's not accurate because the people who actually care about showing the dislikes are those that'll dislike more.

Someone who tends to not care (the majority of people now) won't install that."
"How about it is not accurate because it doesnt actually measure only the people likely to want to see the film to begin with. Like everything else you got a vocal minority of people in the world that are gonna be hating because it is a black girl instead of a white girl. But lets face it, these proud boy wanna bees in their dark basements who are jacking off to cartoon porn of the white girl topless with a fish body because they think titties and bass fishing are both manly things to like, are not going to see the movie anyway.

And when it is finally released it will likely be a number 1 for that week at the box office, and will likely make 1.3 billion dollars for disney off of disney fans and little girls and their families going to the movies."
Anyone who has the addon probably dislikes a lot. Lol
"what button do you think people who installed a dislike counter are more likely to press?

its hilariously biased and im guessing that crowd skews conservative/racist, too."
"The estimate isn't just the number of people with the extension who dislike the video. They take the ratio of views to dislikes for the extension users and extrapolate it out to all viewers. Which means that they assume the people who specifically use an extension that allows them to see dislikes will dislike a video at the same rate as general users, which is an *absurd* assumption.

So no, if anything the real amount of dislikes is much lower."
">I tested it before on videos I have access to and it was over estimating by over 8x. A video with 100 dislikes for example this extension said 967. So it’s garbage.

Someone else mentioning the problem which has been mentioned by bigger source like League of Legend channel in the past."
"> I mean they literally made Snow White a black Character. 

didn't they cast Rachel Zagler as Snow White? who's clearly.... white?"
"You are gonna get replies from other people who agree with him including me. They are taking older movies and recreating with black actors, zero creativity, zero originality, and completely ignoring all black creators who have actual original ideas"
Deleted because I was so very wrong....fucking idiots she's freaking adorable.
"I couldn't care less about her skin colour, but WHT the hells everything so shaded out, like the best part of the lil mermaid my old ass remembers was all the vibrant colors, pretty much everything non Ursula related was bright"
Only good one was Cats.
I don't remember the green skin but the dying by turning into seafoam definitely happened. Weird nobody is complaining about that inaccuracy.
"The version I remember from when I was a kid said the mermaid’s sisters traded their hair to the sea witch in exchange for a magic dagger. The mermaid was supposed to stab the prince in the heart with it in order to return to the sea. When she crept into the couple’s bedroom after the wedding, she saw how happy they were and couldn’t go through with it. She was going to kill herself with the dagger instead, but some sea nymphs convinced her to join them by turning into foam. At least that is what I can remember. Now I’ll have to look for that book lol."
I was like 6 years old when I watched the Disney version .
Makes perfect sense and if you don’t support it you are a racist.  What’s the matter?  You don’t like the idea of race swapping anymore?  Lil
"Okay, I am going to preface this argument with I agree with you and understand what you're saying.

If in everyone's headcannon we took a character that was typically portrayed as a nonwhite person and cast a white person to be it- what would the reaction be?"
"Not at all. It’s the portrayal and if she can hold a note.

Acting > Ethnicity."
"It's not precise but this is the best estimates we can get. 

Plus the users of the extension is huge and randomised, how is that a bias sample?"

People hate this movie."

Hercules is my favorite Disney movie and I'm terrified of it being butchered.
"Even just a Hercules where he plays his original character would be awesome, as long as he gets to keep his song"
Oh my God I forgot about that movie. I swear if they remake Hercules but don't bring back Danny it's going to be a bad movie.
"I want this film to be as low budget as possible. Poorly-fitting costumes, cheap wigs, a few mic boom misplacements.."
Chorus of Devitos telling the story
I would pay a lot of money to see this.
"Danny devito was Phil in the original, so it's not far off."
Devito called them out in an interview recently...he said if they don't get him to reprise philoctetes their idiots.
Plus he makes the perfect phil

Gotta pay the troll toll
"He went into details about that. I think his speculation was partly that the relationship between Scar and the hyenas was different (worse/made less sense) in the remake so the song didn't fit.

But who knows. Based on his video it's clear bad decisions were a staple of the remake."
"No.

There's something more marketable about a cartoon character than live action. Just ask Disney, they've been doing it for 80 years. Wait..."
"They're all very bad, nearly unwatchable movies IMO"
"I watched Cinderella the other day, it's actually pretty fucking good"
"I saw Beauty and the Beast and decided that these live action remakes aren't for me. I didn't think it was bad but the whole time I watched it I couldn't help but think, ""Why don’t I just watch the original?"" Haven't watched one since. 


""Live action"" Lion King seemed especially pointless.  It was all gonna be CG anyways."
"Same. I saw Jungle Book with my kids, and that was it."
I have also avoided them but I couldn't really explain why. Maybe this is subconsciously what I was doing. While I am not a disney fan by any means. I don't want the happy memories associated with those movies to be ruined.
Why would it ruin the originals? That makes no sense.
Aerial lmao.
She’s the female equivalent to James Corden.
"You realize the actors don't write the movie right, she'll probably be written and directed like the Ursula we know. Whether she'll be able to act the part, though..."
Which is pretty damned perfect casting.  I hope he gets a new song that fits his talent.  I also hope that these don't come to the detriment of *Under the Sea* or *Kiss the Girl*.

It pisses me off how Chris Brown has just gotten a pass from society and the entertainment industry for being a woman abusing piece of shit. Anyone in that industry that likes him or is friends with him gives me immediate red flags and tells me they aren’t above that level of abuse as well.
Daewoo?  I ain't riding in no DAEWOO!
Fuck what a great film. I use it as my number one example of just how truly talented the late great Robin Williams was. RIP
Lizzo's acting was superb. She reminded me of Robin Williams.
LOOLLLLL
"Yep. Not American, thanks. Will try to address that in future comments. What is the best terminology to use now?"
"Prince Ali 

Yes it is he, but not as you know him 

Read my lips, and come to grips with reality.

Say ""Hello!"" To your precious Prince Ali!"
"It happens while Jafar has the genie and reveals Prince Ali to be Aladdin to Jasmine

She’s insufferable even by *Ursula* standards
"It wasn’t just hard work and bravery - it was individualism, self-determination. and breaking out of the preconceived rules of a restricted society. The reason this was taken out was because this is antithetical to Chinese communism."
Worse live action remake easy because it was pretty much not even a Mulan movie change the names and I can garuntee no one would tell.
That’s what I disliked the most about it. The original character used her wits and determination to become a capable warrior and outthink the enemy. Her super-power was thinking differently. It’s why that movie holds up.
[This video essay by Accented Cinema](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZccG-wtt5FA) has a pretty good reflection on where the live action Mulan went wrong.
The ironic part of the whole thing is that China didn't really care for the Mulan live action.
“Mulan is just built different.”
"Which is my main issue with making Ariel black. 

Unless they go with an entirely black cast, it takes away the plot of Ariel just being another girl with nothing obviously special about her to set her apart, trying to gain the Prince’s affection. 

I hate diversity for diversity’s sake, and just hope they can make the story work. People argue there’s no reason for a mermaid to be white, but in the context of the animated movie, she had to be because everyone else was, too."
And awkwafina is scuttle!
Unexpected role for my boi Diggs.
They definitely weren't always that bad I'd say Frozen 1 was the start of their downfall in honesty. Princess and the frog and Rapunzel was great Frozen 1 i feel was dull. The concept art for it was amazing and I blame them wanting to change the story on why 1 was not great but Frozen 2 was pretty ok. I wish they would at least dabble with 2d again.
"Oof.  I get that he is the hottest property going, but Lin Manuel Miranda?    I don't see the fit.

But what do I know... I didn't like that Bruno song, which clearly puts me in the minority."
You say that as if Mulan's story didn't get complete changed from finding her own strength into magic chosen one. I don't think they'll remove the songs (fingers crossed) I'm worried they might minimize it have her specifically sing 1 or 2 songs and done.
Unless they want to go the real story route and Ariel dies voiceless while the Prince and his Fiancée get married.
"I think there either is one or will be one with them redoing splash mountain. Yeah it was a fantastic movie and I enjoyed every single song in it. Message was good, music good, visuals good. The only downside like I mentioned before she was the first and only black princess whose 90% of the movie was a frog. That drew them some flak when it came out."
"I mean,  a quick google will show you that the songs and sidekick characters characters will all be there."
"Unfortunately one has to look elsewhere (read: not US) for 2D/mixed 2D-3D animation. 

The big theatrical animation studio(s) in the US have all moved onto CGI and 3D work, as that's what appeals most to the local market. At least, those that are still around, considering the tremendous loss of big names over the years."
Gotta move to Japan for that
"Now I just imagined Moana saying “I, am Moana from Motinua from Motinui” but in an Irish Accent."
And Encanto!
Ehh… turning red was passable.
It… doesn’t sound like you enjoyed the movies.
"Disney is outrage baiting in the west because it works, there is nothing woke about any of these movies, they literally support the CCP when they have to"
Because the Chinese have a strong ethnic/cultural sense of identity and will not tolerate it. Disney's only choices are to play ball with them or leave the market.
I dont think it would be doing well if disney or amazon make them. Because they not interested in showing a accurate story. For them there also must be a progressive message mixed in and that destroys not just fictional movies.
I mean it’s impactful for the kids.
These movies proves that Disney is capable of producing great original stories which makes it even more frustrating that they chose to go for nostalgia chash grab remakes of old favorites.
Those sound so interesting! What are the names of the podcasts?
Why would be pissed off about the skin color of a mythological creature?
Is this why all new entertainment is so fucking trite?
"There is no need, because they just have to appease the mainstream and the human mainstream is a bland, capitalist, feel good story that doesnt aquire more than half a braincell to understand. 

Its braindead entertainment that feels life-less. 

But I expect there to be plenty of want. At least I want innovation."
I loved Ponyo
racist AF
"I saw someone on YouTube (black guy) say it quite well, there’s plenty of black mermaid stories out there (just took his word for it, haven’t researched it myself) they don’t need to overwrite this in an attempt to stay woke, just make a new black mermaid movie with an original story. I don’t have a problem with acknowledging things that were wrong, but I don’t really think that race-swapping original Disney princesses is necessary to that, make a new one! That way young black girls get someone they can look up to like they would here, and everyone gets a new movie to watch instead of what’s likely going to happen, where this movie is forgotten about because it’s not going to be as memorable as the original."
"Just a wildly bad idea from the start. And yet nobody along the way said “no, this doesn’t work”…"
Oh well. None of the kids in my third grade class had a problem lol i’m sure all the racists found something else to watch instead. The movie was lovely and lots of us enjoyed it. Especially those of us who are fans of Bernadette peters and Whitney Houston. There was no harm done back then by making the movie and there’s no harm now.
Exactly. It was a bad movie.
Dude wtf are you saying?
"But the movie isn’t for you though, it’s for kids. Just like the 90s movie. The target audience doesn’t care. It’s the adults like you who have any type of feelings about it. Kids can watch the same episode of the same show every single day and not give a crap. Reboots and remakes means nothing to them. So why make a brand new movie if the target audience would not care either way?"
"I wonder why it's assumed... the movie isn't out yet, and it's been criticized heavily for the casting of Ariel. So of course people will assume it's the same criticism when you haven't seen the film yet and haven't explained why you don't like it."
"I think you can stop the “concerned redditor” message bot. I did it a while back and I haven’t received any similar messages.

Someone test it out on me!"
"I think it’s funny to get them because some idiot wasted their time sending you a worthless bot message and you can laugh about how hard they are coping and seething

Edit: Just got one lmao"
Happened to me yesterday. People have too much time on there hands.
"Yeah I think it’s a little pathetic and abusing that feature. It’s happened to me, too.

Edit: Just got another one ☺️ Guess I triggered somebody. Reddit should really alter the feature to let us know the kind redditors who care enough about us to recommend us to these resources. So we can thank them."
"Read that DM. You can actually opt out of getting more. 

Source: Got one randomly as well. 🤷🏼‍♀️"
"It’s okay. 

*hug*"
It is happening all the time now and it’s annoying. Wish Reddit did something about it
Just make sure you’re reporting it
It’s happened to me like 3-4 times after I gave some MAGA hat wearing chud a sad.
Bro you need to talk?
That's what that is???? I've gotten in a few times and I was honestly so confused .
You can report it for harassment
I wonder how that DM looks.
Need to corrupt their initial message like how the Liberal meme artists took Dark Brandon
"In theory, you are able to report someone abusing it by reporting the message that's sent to you. In practice, Reddit doesn't actually do anything about these reports."
"The joke is that there isn't a joke and it's weird and stupid. Like a teenager getting your attention, shouting BEANS and scurrying back to their guffawing friends. If you storm over and tell them 'you don't trouble me with your BEANS jibe, It is of scarce wit and does not reflect any hidden insecurity of mine', that's even more The Joke. They're not going for wit or effect, they just get a kick out of making you think they're weirdos"
People are sick.
">	Only DMs I got were to film it and send it to them.

How?  Who would send it?  Were they expecting Candlejack to click the submit b"
I’ve seen it happen
"You just described the ""Let's Go Brandon"" meme. 

Funny how that meme died on the vine and ""Dark Brandon"" emerged from its fetid ashes, triumphant."
"That's what I was thinking about them blocking you. Lately like 2/3 of the time I get into debates with people on here they type out some long deranged rant as a reply and then block you so you can't respond and it looks like they got the last word. 

Do these people have no desire to be able to respect themselves?"
That was.....specific
You're just floundering.
"I do care about the hair, the vibrant red hair is kind of what makes her stand out, it’s how you notice her on Peter Pan’s Flight"
"Yeah like nothing about her is real or realistic, but everyone just nitpicks the most random things. Copying a hair color from a cartoon would seem like one of the main things that are difficult to replicate without taking everyone out of the movie."
"For real. Nearly every single under water creature I have seen doesn’t make sense. This fish is bright orange and this other thing dangles a lightbulb in front of its face, and the biggest thing eats that shit that just wants a crabby patty. None of it makes sense and I am totally okay with that."
I'm sure the animated movie would still be loved by millions if it included an ugly bald fish as the protagonist.
Because Ariel is known for her hair color. It’s a defining trait.
This made my spit my drink out lol
"When it comes to the actor, I honestly only care about her singing voice, if it’s good than she should be fine"
Mermaids are white?
"because shes s character, a creation,  and the story is being rebooted.  the reaction is racist as is yours."
"People are mad because a) they are racists, or b) this is, to them, an example of “white erasure,” which is something that racists believe. It all comes from the same place."
"Perhaps the issue is the very limited number of roles (especially positive ones) associated with other ethnicities. And many of those associated with a white character had no need to be in the first place (especially fantastical characters). 

So taking more roles and turning them white can be felt as taking away from the smaller group, while the reverse might be a step towards a more balanced and honest reflection of the make up of our societies."
"Have you ever read DiAngelo's book, White Fragility?  She has a very different take than you do on racism.  You might find it interesting."
"How many accounts did you use to dislike the video, and did it help with your overwhelming feelings of oppression as an aggrieved white person?"
The conspiracy has been discovered lol. Or maybe they just made a movie for people. To enjoy? Even minorities ... Or maybe it's both but who cares
"I’m pretty sure the entire idea is that people of color have been historically underrepresented in leading roles. Now that we are in a society that (hopefully) sees everyone as equal… why not start making up for the past and cast people of color?
  
Casting someone white for a historically colored character completely goes against the whole concept of white-washed Hollywood."
"So you're saying you do have a problem with her skin color if you call it race swapping. Name another black female Disney heroine, there's Tiana and... oh wait that's just about fucking it. The original still exists with a white character and everything. They saw a great opportunity to open up a character to a different interpretation that allows little girls to see themselves depicted. Kids. this is for kids."
"Or, they used the vocalist that has been singing professionally Ariel's part for Disney for literally years and she happens to be black.

Occam's Razor and all that, instead of the insane, borderline racist conspiracy theory you're pushing."
"If a character is *written* a particular race, then it's racist to put in a white character for their spot.

I'm not saying that backlash is logical, but you're not using logic either. The old-time non-white characters are usually written such that it's integral to the character. That's why the studios let them be cast (or look dark) at all. Swapping that would unwrite the character. 

It would be just as awful to do that with distinctly white characters. I can't imagine someone trying to do Gone With the Wind and messing up Scarlett. She's white. Period. 

We depart from descriptions all the time, that won't change. But blondeness was never integral to Ariel's identity, nor was having red hair, nor pale skin. I feel like rolling my eyes that people can't cope with that since it's been going on as long as there's been fiction."
"So... if they can't race swap known characters, who can they race swap? Nobody. The status quo in Hollywood has always been white characters. If they're going to remake movies, why not update it to today by making it a bit more diverse instead of ""everyone is white""? 

People used to race swap in the other direction all the time. John Wayne as Genghis Khan? Mickey Rooney in Breakfast at Tiffany's? Yeah. That's why people are sensitive about it.

So calm your tits. It's a black mermaid instead of a white one for a change. Get over it."
"Black Panther is the king of an African country that has been isolated for thousands of years with no white people in it as permanent residents, as well as being named after a black civil rights group

Ariel is the little mermaid from under the sea"
"Ariel’s story does not rely on her being white, black panthers story relies on him being black, I really do love false equivalency"
Well Black Panther is supposed go take place in a country in Africa and The Little Mermaid never specifies
I won’t be happy until we get Michael Cera as Shaft.
"This. 

I always wondered what would happen if white people played known black parts.

I remember reading the voice actor who played Cleveland because he was white."
"The hair is iconic, the skin color is irrelevant

Also, they went for the hair"
"What? Of course there’s going to be CGI and the capability to enhance, or change. Have you seen a movie in the last 10 years?"
"Oof, you better sit down for this one. Time for the ol' hedgehogs and mermaids talk."
"The actors were so lifeless across the board throughout Lion King. I really expected it to have so much heart, but it was just... deflated. No color, no body language, no joy. 

Don't get me started on Scar. They did my boy so dirty."
It has gotten to the point where literal horror movies have better lighting
"Okay, but this is a fairytale movie, not a documentary. You can take liberty with reality to make things brighter but still have it look like nighttime."
">It is not at night

The cartoon scene is literally at night, she swims up to the ship where they are letting fireworks off. 

Thats whats happening at 49 seconds of the new trailer - fireworks at night."
"I mean, that’s what she’s doing in the animated version, lol."
Were sailors fucking manatees?
Flesh eating manatees
"OK, now I really want to see that version of Little Mermaid. She and Ursula join forces to devour the kingdom above."
Found the nun.
Stop moving the goalposts. Clearly that one’s been laying out in the sun too long!
"I was on board with the sunlight argument, but now this completely changed my mind."
"Ariel, the Abyssal Terror"
"Yea someone said that a ""human"" population would ""evolve"" light skin underwater.



...... Like people could evolve to be half fish"
"The sunburn coming off the ice and snow reflections is no joke lol.   It's literally a desert, but with snow instead of sand.  There are several month long periods where it is basically night though, depending upon how far north you are."
It's called melanin.  Black people have it in abundance to limit sun exposure in equatorial areas.  White people lost their melanin as they left Africa and settled in areas where very little sunlight.  The body produces an essential vitamin through a process that requires sunlight exposure.  White people evolved to have less melanin as the lightest skinned people now had a massive advantage in survival.
"Belugas, they’re not fish, but mammals…

There’s literally “whitefish” tho."
Why would they go with shark and not dolphin? I'm assuming fictional mermaids are mammals though. Maybe not.
Yer fond of me lobster?
"And yes, he was portraying an anatomically correct mermaid vagina"
"They should have, but that would be woke enough."
She trained for months to be able to breathe and sing underwater!/s
"The funny part is the ending is supposed to be happy because she earns a soul by not murdering the man who spurned her.

She's offered another chance at life if she murders him but she doesn't and so she turns into seafoam, but in doing so, she earns a soul, which other mermaids (such as her 7(?) sisters) lack.

It's a classic and honestly a decent story but yeah, it's so very little like the Disney story in core themes beyond ""There's a mermaid who makes a semi-faustian bargain for a man."""

"“You just can’t see it in the black and white video, but it’s totally red”

Edit: Dang, I thought we were just trolling stupid people, and it turns out he he actually had a red tint due to his lineage. Now I’m stupid too :("
"The reaction to this every time tells me the woke agenda is necessary and working, and needs to expand. This is what you get after a century of white washing."
"Wouldn’t doing something so opposite of what was done before be done intentionally?

I’d rather they write new stories for black actors than to pander and race swap. 

Also, wasn’t there a ton of backlash for Scarlett Johansson playing a transgender role? Or Matt Damon for playing an Asian role? Or when they changed the deathnote actor to a white guy people were upset? 

So are those people racist for not letting a white person play those roles?"
"I don’t know if you’re trolling but the actress playing Ariel is not Halle Berry. Halle Bailey is playing Ariel. Berry has no association with the movie other than being confused for an actress 40+ years her junior, and honestly? Good for her lol"
"I'm referring to character design, and how the idea of ""well, you accepted all of this also"" didn't apply, as you are, somehow okay with magic metal, but not native-americans. Ariel is white. Maybe my example didn't get the point accross. White Blade, would you be okay with it?"
"I will simply put it this way. If you are in favor of raceswapping, you lost the ability to complain about white washing without being racist."
Yeah I'm pale and have every hair color in my beard. If I grow my beard out people are surprised that I'm a redhead. I'm not.
"> some other type of magical being.

If that's what you want to call sea foam, then sure, go ahead, I guess."
The way I just HOWLED...amazing comment!
It was said the Prince’s Kingdom was located in Italy whilst the plants were based off of The Mediterranean. I don’t think even Disney knows where this is set.
Yes it was always about faithfulness to the Disney version. That's kinda obvious
"In the original HC Andersen version, her skin is compared to the softness of rose petal and her eyes are blue. Other than that, no mention of skin color nor hair color. 

Like with almost every other detail in the story, Disney was very liberal in changing almost everything in the story. E.g. in the original the prince does not love her so she dies unhappily and becomes sea foam."
But pale compared to what? I knew a guy from Cameroon who was so black he almost looked purple in the right light and the whites of his eyes were brown. Literally everyone on earth is pale compared to him.
"Yes, JEJ is an iconic Darth Vader voice...

Thanks for pointing out one of the most unique things in media."
Nah that’s lye. Black people jump through major hoops to make their hair straight like white people
All I said was that bright red hair is an iconic staple to the character. Not sure why that’s an issue. How does that make me deserve the vitriol insults from you?
"The mutation you'd need to have would also cause your skin to be much lighter as well. I don't think you can get anyone as dark as Haley Bailey with red hair in real life. As far as the film is concerned, I don't care what colour hair she has."
I liked that one.
"Fuck no, they just made the movie to renew the copyright."
"I hate to bring this up, but I'm too much of a pedant and it physically upsets me. If the movie is entirely computer generated, it is NOT a ""live"" movie. People talk about this movie like it's a ""LIVE ACTION"" adaptation and it very simply isn't. It's just a BAD REMAKE."
I read somewhere that cartoons should be drawn that you can understand the story and their emotions without any audio . With original movie it was like that.
It was so soulless. I couldn’t even finish it. The animated original is the only one I acknowledge lol.
"I expected to love the ""real"" Lion King but I hated it. I expected to hate the new Aladdin but I liked it."
"Same! I actually never cared for the animated Jungle Book, but the CGI/live action one was super fun. Christopher Walken as King Louie was excellent."
"I loveeeeeed Cinderella. I thought the costume design, music, etc was great. I feel like people forget about it."
Dude that T-Rex was totally real! What are you talking about? /s
just like ghost in the shell!
"I don't think they say that because of racist reasons. If they cast Ariel to be played by a white guy, a million people would point out she's woman."
I sincerely loved it
"That asshole saying you do need the extension is actually right. However, no one is listening to the asshole because the asshole is such an asshole.

With the extension, your downvote instead is sent to an API that is also willing to return data.

That guy is still an asshole, though."
"YES YOU DO.

How the fuck do you think it counts the dislikes?  It needs the extension to be running to count it.

YT has turned off API access to the number.  The only way this extension works is by storing dislikes it sees from others with the extension running.

Sorry if I’m coming off like an ass but this thread has me seriously doubting humanity - however I want to also apologize for a Newsweek article as proof (it’s towards the end)

"Someone was trying to say that “all these remakes have been replacing gingers with black people… it’s like ok so which ones?  Name me the movie remakes where only gingers are being replaced ?? Can they?  Probably not.

Probably some meme on FB said it and now they parrot it like the sheep they think “woke” people are.

Awesome username btw ;)"
This is called a dog whistle.
"Hmmm...is Pocahontas (learn to spell, please) a real person with descriptions and even artwork from her lifetime?

Is Ariel a real person at all?  Hell, for 152 years, she didn't even have a name until Disney gave it to her.

Do you see the difference?

Edit: In response to /u/awaniwono (I've been blocked by the other guy (see the following conversation if you're curious)):

Black Panther is literally defined by his race and culture, which is race specific for historical reasons (it's even in the name).  His race, *and how society has treated people of his race*, has a massive impact on his character. So, are you saying that Ariel is defined by her race and that has an impact on the character?   How exactly has her race defined her role as princess?

But I'll give you credit, you at least went with a person that isn't real."
"Exactly, a little mermaid live action Remake probably would have bombed because A people hate their live action remakes and B no one needs a new little mermaid movie

With this outrage they make sure to create max engagement, like tabloid media"
"Yeah, this is what i am saying for a while now - if they want to represent something then do it, but actually do it originally - just making an OG character or story about social values of 21.century is bad - there are so many stories about basically everyone, but they take stories we already known, oftentimes since birth, and change them and use them as ragebait for these identity issues 

Like, americans dont get how awful this truly is - and i repeat i am a POC myself, this isnt the kind of representation we need at all"
"Oh if all they've done is cast Halle and the movie otherwise turns out to be a masterpiece true to the original like beauty and the beast was ill happily eat my hat. 

But it won't. This is signposting that they will yet again butcher a beloved story with its live action version. But I'd like to be proven wrong because I loved little mermaid as a child. But after Aladdin I'm done and won't be going to the cinema to see it. I have zero faith in them. 

I'm all for inclusiveness. But why can't they just make a different movie in that case. Why the need to race swap at all. Just make a great movie with an original or new POC lead role."
"I liked that they put Slow Sonic into the Rescue Rangers film, the movie that no one asked for

The entire film was basically just advertising for other movies, kind of like The Smurfs did, but it was still funny to me"
"People can say what they want about racists and such and they're right. At the same time, Disney casting the people they cast are ensuring this film is nominated for awards if not award winning. There's no way award shows would fail to nominate this movie after all this drama, it's a way for them to virtue signal if nothing else."
"But I thought it was fantasy, shouldn't it be bright like the source material?"
"Following that logic, there should be no mermaids or singing fish in the movie because they don’t exist. It’s fiction, you’re allowed to use your imagination and make technically incorrect adaptations to make it more visually appealing."
It's a teaser trailer for a movie that is definitely not finished. I wouldn't judge it against an already completed movie just yet.
Sort by new if you want a more clear understanding of why those dumb astroturfed comments are so prominent
"You know what, I like this a lot more than what was there a couple days ago"
A thread full of dumb jokes? Are you sure you didn’t fall back into Reddit?
"For the little mermaid trailer?

Why not do it for rings of power then? 

This trailer more dislikes then all of the ring of power dislikes combined."
Tbh this would actually be an original movie
Don’t forget the little dangly lure thing. Not sure it would be on the forehead though…

I would watch this. Plus they could still make it kid friendly with the songs. She’s still beautiful. But make her look like a real deep sea creature and the transformation is actually impressive.
Like a great big sea anemone on top of her head.
Bioluminescent Medusa?
Blobfish Ariel is the ending we all want.
"Would never happen tho because this would scare off midwestern moms in their fifties. 

Tbh the black mermaid also does, so they just should have gone full lovecraft with this anyways"
If you want a good killer mermaids story with a twist give *Into the Drowning Deep* a try.  Fun book.
"I actually saw an interesting video explaining that it was probably set in the danish colonies in the carribean. (Eg mountains visible from the water, the prince owning slaves even though slavery was abolished in mainland denmark a while before the story was written but not in the colonies, the colourful reefs etc)"
"Yeah, but African mermaids are much cooler than European ones. They're not just ""pretty woman with fish tail"". And some can shapeshift too, similar to other mythological beings, like Ananci."
"Funny you should say that, quote me the part that says there’s a reef."
Those bastard liberals lol
It shouldn’t matter
Looking forward to the scene where Ariel is bycatch and dies gasping for air in a two ton pile of Chilean seabass
Brainwashed consumer thinks they are fighting for equality by shilling for generic blockbuster movie.
If that is the case why was the lobster Jamaican? You can’t tell me you didn’t see this coming.
"The writer of this story was a white guy in Denmark, so a white girl for a mermaid is about right for people who naturally lived there, whatever that means.

I’ll bet if an Asian from centuries ago wrote this story, the mermaid would have been Asian, no matter where the ship sunk in the story."
"You’d have a point if the story wasn’t Danish in origin.

Also while the walls of the castle are built of coral a reef isn’t described while many aquatic plants are.

One of the Mermaids lays on an iceberg while observing ships, sounds very equatorial to me!

So tell me who is erasing or ignoring cultural history here?"
"Yeah, but those populations don't live underwater where they have minimal sunlight. They leave on the islands where it is glaring sunlight all the time. Since mermaids are so different from humans in terms of biology and can swim anywhere it is very likely that they wouldn't be evolved directly from the locals. And to further back that idea up, mermaids have appeared in many different cultures across the world from the Syrians to the Norse, so a specific genetic background seems hard to back up with real world connections.

Also not sure where you got the idea that mermaid's in the Disney universe needed coral.

Look, I don't have anything against the casting. I'm not going to watch the movie anyways and given Disney normally making terrible live action remakes I'm sure that the race of the actors will be the least of our concerns. But let's not try and use real world biological science to prove our agendas. Mermaids are magic, they don't follow biology."
"Oh agreed, it's not the cartoon and it can by all means change things.  
And if it's good (meaning, as you said - kids will enjoy it) then it did its job.  

There can still be a sort of nostalgic measurement of ""goodness"" for the older generation who would want to see it to relive the experience of the previous work.  
But I doubt that's the primary goal and audience, so sucks to be them."
"It’s a community that has visibly and demonstrably shrunk for decades now. People, especially idiots on social media, just do not have the ability to place an accurate number. They, you, see one or two posts and try to extrapolate (imagine) a problem of far greater magnitude. Plus, the barrier for entry to be called a [whatever] shrinks right along with it. Now everything’s dog whistles and imaginary sleights.

Racism is shrinking. It really used to be so much worse."
Here's the video. Tell me where Disney was behind this and how much of the actual trailer you see. Think before your racist logic spews out words next time -- https://www.youtube.com/shorts/vsu0oNlCOb8
"Do you even know the video I’m talking about? Haha it was not an advertisement. But if your racist POV can’t grasp black kids might be genuinely excited they see someone like them in a Disney movie, that’s on you."
">	Not sure why you’d think otherwise.

Because the people who complain that they can’t criticize anything without being called racist, are (more often than not) actually espousing racist opinions and getting rightfully called out for them.

The next step in the cycle is the victim card, where they cry about how misunderstood they are and how they’re not allowed to dislike anything now because everyone else just wants to “virtue signal”.

It’s all just a way for racists to be racists, without suffering any of the real world social consequences  for being racist."
"The problem isn’t that there’s a character with black skin, it’s the fact that theirs no explanation or rhyme or reason given by the show as to why there are different skin colors. Characters in middle earth are famously racist against each other, but they don’t care about skin color? Or any explanation where the different races came from?"
"Edit: lmao and you guys wonder why we get fed drivel and lazy reboots at the box office.

There are a few factors at play here. Personally Amazon is a billion dollar company, they dropped a billion on this show specifically with the intention of being it the most watched show of the year, so not gonna lie, I feel like people deserve to be picky on whether or not it's good. I don't get why people are up in arms to defend this show by this company, it's like they have a personal stake in the show doing well, so much so that they're going to ignore errors that they might think are trivial. This company dropped a billion on this show, they could've spent some of that on actually trying to fit the established lore. They aren't, and are actively trying to subvert specific pieces of the lore in an attempt to make this story their own. Essentially, this company bought the name so they could use it to field their own fantasy story without having to do any of the world building themselves and are only taking the parts they liked. Really, anyone defending the show for being fun should probably try and understand that they're paying a billion dollar company to do this with zero repercussions. Frankly, that should set off alarms from the get go.

Now for the meat; everyone is up in arms over the black elf, and everyone is defending the decision. Problem is, Tolkien specifically created the story because the ancient cultures of Britain were mostly erased by Catholicism and the Roman empire, leaving a huge amount of history gone never to be seen or read from again. Imagine your culture losing their entire heritage. Now imagine trying to create a myth to fill that gap, so that in the future hundreds of years from now they are telling Tolkien's stories the same way we tell stories of Huckleberry Fynn and Tom Sawyer, or Perseus and Odysseus, or stories of ancient Chinese martial artists. Now imagine taking a work that was viewed with that significance and commercializing it, selling it to the highest bidder, and seeing millions of people ignore the cultural significance because it's fun. That story doesn't belong to us, in the same way a story about the Pharos doesn't belong to us, or a story from the Inuit. It should be treated like they treated Moana, with a thorough understanding of the heart of the work and representing as accurate a portrayal as possible. Hell, even the movies made some huge errors and simply spawned an era of cash grab movie tie ins that worked to further dismantle the lore. The black elf by himself, not a problem. The black elf on top of their portrayal of Galadriel, racist Irish stereotypes in the hobbits, a focus on character drama as opposed to myth building, I know this is a meme but the beardless dwarf, these errors stack up and build a clear picture. That clear picture is that Amazon couldn't give less of a fuck about what Middle Earth was all about and is only trying to cash in. They spent a billion dollars, they could afford to have done a little bit more research. I'm not gonna give them my money for this, and it's a shame so many are willing to."

"Exactly. As someone who grew up in the 80s and 90s with all these animated originals, I haven't actually enjoyed any of the live action remakes. But they're not for me! Sure, it would be ideal if they were enjoyed by all ages but at the end of the day, if the kids like 'em, who cares!

We had the original as kids. They still exist. What different does it make if there's an updated version for a new generation, even if it is a worse film? We didn't pay for it..."

"Because representation aims for the « base » of a country. Asians in america still have asian culture, the immigrated to america. Mexicans in america still have mexican culture, they immigrated, etc. (Point being these are groups of people who chose to immigrate to a country with a different racial profile and culture). Its like if you moved to korea, you wouldnt expect korean films to force white people into movies to cater to you.
For african americans its different, they wherent voluntary immigrants, they are part of the « original » racial profile of the country, but weren’t represented as such in the past.

This is imo why this trend is good from an American pov, but as a european its strange."
Keanu Reeves and Dwayne the Rock Johnson. The world isn’t as black and white as people want it to be.
Will they use bad CGI filters to make her skin white as snow?
"Nope. I’m gonna assume you’re being serious and not trying to be snarky with your comment. 

How often do you have an Asian playing a masculine leading man? Romantic heartthrob that isn’t a scraggly underdog? Suave action star that isn’t a foreign kung fu master? Super hero… that isn’t a foreign kung fu master? An assassin who also isn’t a foreign kung fu master?

Not to mention most “Asian” roles are played by Chinese actors. I guess people must still think that Asian = Chinese in Hollywood. And that is also means foreign kung fu master.

Let’s not pretend that Asians are well represented in media. They’re typecasted into oblivion with only damaging, stereotype reinforcing roles available to them."
"That’s true! I also hate this “if they made a black character white it would cause outrage!” schtick. Deeply disingenuous argument. 

Now just have to hope the actual production behind the movie is good and not a half-arsed cash-grab which will add fuel to the fire. Haven’t loved a lot of the live action adaptations, but I have hopes for this one."
"I don’t know if this was always the *intention* behind the story (especially as the original is a) extremely old, and b) explicitly says those love stories must end in tragedy.) I think the point of the original movie is that love can transcend any barriers, but not sure in the 80s children cartoon they were thinking explicitly of race. 

But it is certainly the best interpretation of the themes, the most prescient way of applying those themes to our age, and applying a visible racial dynamic to the cross-species love story makes that very explicit and clear, which is nice. Still would have liked black Eric, though, to be honest. I don’t know if it’s my own biases from what I watch but I feel like there’s increased representation of black women but black men don’t get into the hero/Prince role in these sorts of movies very often, which feels…loaded."
"I’ve just seen that! Gross. 

Note they also edited the character to have way more make up etc. and then described it as “fixing the woke movie” but in the comments said “it’s for educational purposes - we’re not racist!” 

Sure, Jan."
"Annie and Wonka aren’t Disney princesses, Merida and Anna are. So, kids do have the experience that  I had. And now more kids will have it due to black Ariel. 

I think Disney should be writing original stories for black characters. But casting one character as black in a pantheon of white characters - in a movie where the entire soundtrack is inspired by Caribbean influences - isn’t worthy of review bombing or harassing the actress involved."

Tiana from Princess and the Frog spends most of the movie as a frog

Even Spies in Disguise had their black lead spend most of the movie as a bird.

Most recently, Joe Gardner from Pixar’s *Soul* is a black man who is transformed into a spirit for a large portion of the film, and even a cat throughout. And Meilin from *Turning Red* transforms into a red panda constantly 

I’m not making a judgment on whether or not it’s racist, but it’s a really weird trend"
Yeah just a thumbs up button only.
Mermaids are a minority among the human society that Ariel longs to be a part of.  She is not an accepted part of that society.
"She exists in the context of the movie, dear.  And she doesn’t enter the Prince’s palace to see mermaids flopping around all over the kingdom.

I am aware that she didn’t actually do *anything* for real, sure."
South Asian was Raya.  Middle Eastern and some Indian actors was Aladdin 2019.
"Nobody is forcing anything. The director said that she set the bar high and nobody was able to pass that. They obviously chose her for a reason, she just happens to be also black. Her race doesn’t affect the story so it doesn’t matter anyway"
Then clarify the reason you dislike it. If it’s not race motivated there’s no reason for a criticism to be labeled racist.
"Da faq? Italians are Southern Europeans…they’re white just as much as us slavs, or as much as celts or germanic folks."

Changing the race of Black Panther 100% changes the story. Are you familiar with the character in the comics?
Please explain the themes of little mermaid and tell the class how her skin tone are unique to the themes of alienation and unrequited love.  Like what you feel with your family.
"Black Panther is the king of an African country that has been isolated for thousands of years with no white people in it as permanent residents

Ariel is the little mermaid from under the sea"
POC being race swapped to be white are literally all adaptations up until maybe the early 2000s. Go cry about your false sense of white erasure somewhere else…
"Of all the examples to choose, you chose the dumbest one to try and make you’re point."
"Probably a bad example my friend... The whole premise of Black Panther revolves around the race of the character.

Little mermaid could be any color and it wouldn't change ANYTHING about the story."
"Changing the race of a character written specifically to belong to an African nation with clear African motifs is not the same as changing the race of an imaginary half human creature where the race of its human half has no impact on the story.

Is there anything about the Little Mermaid that only works if she is white? Would the fish half being a different fish be a problem too?"
A major conflict about Black Panther is how black people are treated around the world. How would that hold up if Black Panther was white?
You could have not used a poorer example to make your point my god
"When changing the race of the character changes the story it would be an issue, but in the case of Ariel it doesn’t at all. Atlantis isn’t real"
"I mean, if you thought about it at all then you already know why Black Panther is different from Ariel. Like Ariel is not a symbol for white people, in case you *haven't* actually given it any thought.

White people have no end of representation, so white characters are not designed to be representative of their race or culture. Minorities do not have that same scale of representation, so cultural authenticity features more heavily in their background, values, and general character.

Its also not really cultural appropriation because of context. Europe subjugated and stamped out many cultures around the world, cherry picking things they liked to take home and integrate into their own culture as well as forcing their own culture onto those subjugated. For this reason, European culture is not unnatural or approriated for those colonized."
"Black Panther is a story set in Africa featuring a Black kingdom. Race is an integral part of the story.

Ariel is an imaginary creature who lives in the ocean.

Your argument is invalid."
"They’d call it the Hunger Games, or Ghost in the Shell, or Aloha, or Avatar, or Pan, or really whatever they want since they already do this regularly."
"A big part of black panther was his identity. It not the same with the little metmaid.  Shes meant to be Danish but no one cared when they stripped her of that identity because her heritage/race is not integral to the story.

Considering that white straight men have the majority of screen time, when you take issue with a race swap or a female lead or a gay character.

You are racist, sexist and homophobic. Simple as."
"Black Panther is about an African superhero, its people and about cultural heritage. It would be the same as changing Shang Chi. If Michael Cera played both it would be fucking weird.

Little Mermaid is about a bunch of sirens that are not real. She could be blue and no one would give a shit. The problem is that she is actually black. The same story could be told using any ethnicity BUT people care more about ""wokeness"" on a cash grab movie than about poverty or the environment.

Would you use Chris Rock to play Kennedy? Would you use Chris Tucker to play Mao? Nope. Little Mermaid is a MERMAID. She can be played by ANY ethnicity."
Changing the color of black panther would change the story
">The argument is if Disney wants a remake of a classic, they should try to stick to the original context as much as possible, especially when she is the main character.

Why?"
"In the little mermaid tale, you know, what the movies based on? It never mentions their race. The little mermaid source material keeps it vague and non descriptive and an animation studio 30 years ago _chose_ to make her white. Ariel is not a ""white character"" its a mermaid. It could be purple ffs"
What’s the point of remaking something if you change nothing?
WTF are you talking about? Fictional mermaids of Asian descent? I didn’t see Matsyāṅganā in the original anywhere.
Why does that matter?
Ariel’s “race” is mermaid. There would be an issue with race in this movie if it was called the Little Mermaid and then a Minotaur swims in and starts singing part of your world. There is nothing in The Little Mermaid that requires the actress playing her to be anything but a good actress and singer.
"Listen to yourself, asian decent mermaids?! 

[Mermaids aren’t real.](https://youtu.be/0nVGCVlCzL0)"
Ariel was also a Danish character but white Americans don't seem to care about her identity changing as long as it represents them.
What race was Jesus?
So you just proved that the race absolutely doesn't matter
"A “well known” character? You understand that Disney was in no way the first to tell this story, right?"
"You know that this is a dishonest comparison.

Black Panther’s race is relevant to the character because it is about an isolationist African country that repelled the attempted imperialism/colonialism. 

Race is in no way relevant to Ariel’s character. She’s a mermaid in an entirely fictional setting that has no basis in real life history like Wakanda does.

I’m sure you’ve asked this question or read it 100x and gotten the answer to why it is such a shitty comparison 100x and you still post it. This is a shitty comparison and you can just be honest and say you don’t want a black actress instead of acting like you have a good or logical argument."
"A TON of movies have been whitewashed by hollywood throughout its history.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitewashing\_in\_film](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitewashing_in_film)

So why is it suddenly a problem when it's the other way around?"
"This is like the 20th time I've seen this, but when Disney made the Little Mermaid  there was no conscious thought pu thg into her race because that was the norm (and had been for decades and still is arguably). Black Panther was created specifically to challenge that norm. There's a massive difference. Also, you get white Jesus, can they not have a mermaid?"
"“Well known.” So you’re upset that a new adaptation of a story isn’t the version you grew up with, even though that was also adapted from another story with details about the main character purposefully changed as well.

The black panther isn’t an adaptation of an adaptation of an adaptation. That’s a fucking moronic argument."
"Black Panther is not a good example since his entire character is based on blackness.

How about a white Blade? Or a Latino or Asian Blade? Sure let’s try it."
You're missing the point. White actors have historically and frequently played roles where the original source character was of color. So when a fictional character exists (like a mermaid) it can be played by any person. Not just a white person simply because Disney drew her that way in 1989.
"It’s Ariel… a cartoon… you’ve gotta be kidding me w comparing it the black panther. Notice how he’s from Africa? An African? Did the movie say Ariel was European! She’s a MERMAID and the last time I checked mermaids DONT HAVE A RACE lmao, they live in the ocean you smarty pants"
Explains how it doesn’t. We know it does but if you are presenting the question you must have a counter for why it would change.
"a big part Black Panther's character is being African. Their whole thing is being a super highly advanced civilization in the middle of Africa. Of course he will be black, his race has an impact. Ariel's race has literally no impact on the story they are trying to tell. At all. Your argument is ridiculous"
How is Ariel's whiteness an integral part of her character compared to Black Panther's blackness?  One is the ruler of a technologically advanced African civilization the other is a mermaid teenager.  Ariel being white isn't material to her character.
"That’s a bad example because black panther is based on a fictional group that so happen to be all black.

Now, unless theres a plotline that explains how a white girl/guy came to wukanda, etc, then that would make sense.

But the fact that you have to change/create a whole story to fit in a white character into a native Wakanda character… just shows that it would never work, or be an overall bad story (could be good if done right potentially)

You can’t say the same for my little mermaid tho. The color of the mermaid plays no significant role in the movie. The mermaid could be Asian, middle eastern, Mexican, and the story would still be the same"
"Point out where it says anywhere the race of the little mermaid. She was not a ""white character"" she was a character thats originally source material was vague and non specific in race and animation studio _chose_ to make her white. Its a mermaid. It could be fucking purple"
"Its not the same. It doesnt even tip the scale  when a black character replaces a white one, but because there are so few black idols on screen, a white person taking the role from one would be much more unbalanced because the majority of idols on screen are white men.

Considering that white straight men have the majority of screen time, when you take issue with a race swap or a female lead or a gay character.

You are racist, sexist and homophobic. Simple as."
"Do you have any ideas how many movies swap out black, asian, native, black, etc for white actors? How many movies and shows are white washed? Yet you never make as sound about that, do you? Even good ol Jesus is white washed. You only bitch when it's women and/or black people. It's pathetic."
"That’s a false equivalency.

 Being black is a part of black panthers character, lore, background, nationality.

Being white is in no way part of Ariel’s character. She is the exact same character if she’s black, white, or Asian. It doesn’t matter."
In the context of a Back majority society with an undeserved White population it would be fucking fantastic.

"So say they recast her to a white girl due to all the backlash. You’d have no issue with that?

And I’m pretty sure it’ll be added to Disney plus, so you’d only have to buy a subscription I guess"
"Well the thing is, people do care about race and representation, and people do care when diversity is blatantly shoved down our throats and they care when they’re called a racist even when they’re not"
"you keep going back to her being black, i have not projected once, fuck ur stupid probably american"
For me the characters appearance matters. Yes. And so it does for a lot of people. Otherwise it wouldn't be so controversial
Because when did Ariel's whiteness affect the plot of the original?
"Yes, I specifically said I wasn't talking about old Disney because they have changed.

I made a generalist statement that you're taking literally. You're trying to defeat a point that I wasn't actually making, and telling me now that I'm ""doubling back"" by providing context. No thanks."
"And a lot of those popular movies and shows were watched and popularized by black people rather than white people.

No one but you said they don't matter. I just said the trend is clear. But go ahead and reference the 60s and 70s as if they were kind to Black people."

Why do you care so much about this topic when it impacts you little to none?
Lol I work in film as a producer among a few other gigs. It always comes down to boring ole statistics 90% of the time
"So youre upset about this little mermaid being black even though you were still a sperm in your dads nutsack when the original was released and popular. Thats even weirder lol. I think the solution is simple, we get Samuel L Jackson to play the little mermaid. Only way id watch some disney live action abomination in the first place"
"So why not consider this new Ariel the Ultimate Disney Universe version? This is Ariel from another mermaid universe. And in THIS universe, she's not white. Why is that so hard to accept? If you're able to accept a new Nick Fury and find a reason to be okay with it, why not a new Ariel? Why not consider this a parallel Disney universe?"
"You're right, I don't know anyone. But most of my friends are various races, genders, and orientations, and the white people I know aren't vocal racists. And yet, racists still exist."
"Well, I agree with people being annoyed by the remake itself.  so many, so unnecessary.  So running out of ideas."

"Corporations videos get disliked hell very often, so they pressured YouTube to get rid of them."
"It's actually much more nefarious than other explanations suggest:  Fact is, YouTube doesn't give a fuck about its users.  All they want is to maximize the time its users spend watching videos.  It turns out that people are trying to reach a stage of satisfaction watching videos.  After reaching that satisfied feeling they stop watching and do something else.  If YouTube serves you shitty videos, you tend to watch MORE, because you are looking for a satisfying feeling.  By hiding the negative votes, you are more likely to waste more of your time watching shitting videos and therefor spending more time watching YouTube. It's not political. It's driven purely by YouTubes desire to exploit their users to maximize profits."
People negative bombing and a general increase in extrinsic toxicity.
the internet has become a series of mobs
"iirc the ""official answer"" is to avoid dislike attacking; you dislike a video because you see others disliking the video, similar to review and downvote bombing"
The Biden White House didn't like how many dislikes they were getting.
It happened right after Biden’s inauguration speech got disliked into oblivion.
revenge of the monarchy
Same reason why Amazon deleted all negative Rings of Power reviews on IMDB.
To make even the most gobshit garbage video viable for advertising.
"Whatever the reason, its made the platform borderline unusable for education purposes now. 

Used to be that if you needed to know something you could find a video and gauge immediately the accuracy of the information by the dislike ratio. Not anymore."
You would think they would just remove likes and dislikes completely rather than skewing the numbers openly.
People wanted to be shitty without the feelings getting hurt.
"Useful for knowing if a “How To” video is going to be helpful, though lol"
"You're probably right. But, I'd still prefer to have it than not."
Likes can be just as dishonest as dislikes.
Thank you! Couldn’t agree more. It’s all ruined by trolls and toxicity now.
It can be useful to see whether a video is disliked because it says something about the audience watching it. Why would the corporation submitting the video care? Dislikes are still engagement.
It sends a message that people don’t like it and want to see less of it.
" You say that like removing dislikes doesn't also stop people from showing dislike towards bigoted content and the like. Allowing people to ""vote"" on wether or not their opinion of a video is positive or negative IS democracy even if a majority of people voting on that specific video is racist.

 See, people you disagree for (arguably very valid) reasons being allowed the same vote as you is democracy and taking the choice to vote away from everyone is not closer to democracy in any way."
"That makes sense. Figured it was that, but wasn't sure if there's ways to see the true data if someone has an API key or something."
Ahh. Thanks for the clarification.
According to other comments it just “predicts” them using data from people who use the plugin (which are probably bias and prone to dislike videos). It’s not the actual true count and usually is much higher than the true figure).
"I do enjoy reality, and ignoring Internet nuts."

"They are doing the same things with the rings of power and house of dragons. They just don’t get how there could be Black people in a made up fantasy land. Be it Middle Earth or Westeros. 

But then again, they didn’t understand GoT either."

Your preference is based on Disney cartoon. In the books she has blonde hair or is that too controversial for you as well.
"No, he's right. The way they typed it would read as ""1000 * 500,000"" even though they meant ""1500 * 1000"" with the difference being a single s at the end. this is why it's better to just type the numbers."
Tech bros are upset about a black mermaid then. Not too surprising lol
Oh it extrapolates what it might be? So there aren't actually 1.5 million people with the extension who clicked dislike?
They have data from people who use it and can roughly estimate the total. It isn’t exact but should provide a rough idea of the ratio which is plenty informative for a viewer.
"I’m aware, but that value isn’t laughably small. You can get a rough estimate of the ratio by comparing the ratio of the users using the extension (which they have) with the total likes. Do you actually think that trailer has a positive like dislike ratio which goes against what the extension says?"
"Right?  These people are self-selecting for being mad about dislikes being gone.  If they aren't disproportionately assholes looking to dislike everything, I'll eat a sock."
You can extrapolate that data to give you a rough estimate based off the total views of the video
Sounds like big cope

I think you’re both wrong. It’s not a political tool, it’s a tool people who want to dislike a shitty video use. 99% of the time it has nothing to do with your politics."
"That's a legit complaint, all of the live action remakes have had such a muted color tone to them and it's annoying as fuck. The colors are more muted than reality!"
Here me out; we don't need to even imagine doing that because we've already done that a lot throughout cinematic history.
"One has to do with Egypt, it's literally in the name. People live in Egypt and always have. By making this comparison, are you trying to claim people live at the bottom of the ocean?"
"People who download an extension to view dislikes seem much more likely to dislike videos, not only as a matter of form but because with dislikes visible they know their dislike are feeding the number of dislikes on a specific video. That's a big reason why YouTube removed the visibility of dislikes in the first place."
"People hate the idea of the movie, no one has seen it yet."
"**""Google is planning to shut down this API on December 13""**

Also by the creator of the extension:

>""the likes and dislikes made by **extension users** to show""

The dislikes is not from the website itself but estimated guess based on the extension users pressing dislike."
"Exactly. The API has been pulled, so it’s all based on extrapolated data

“Once the API has been pulled, the extension will then switch to using ""a combination of archived dislike stats, estimates extrapolated from [user] data and estimates based on view/like ratios for videos whose dislikes weren't archived and for outdated dislike archives"".”"

I mean, you _had_ to have recruited them and convinced them to join your cause, I don’t think you can get much from just being rude (unless they were recruited from fear). I remember Shan Yu from Mulan also treated his troops fairly, although, he was a general."
I didn't watch it so I didn't know that. Seems like they could have adjusted the lyrics to suit their relationship? For me it's more about the way it's sung then the actual lyrics.
"bullshit. Scars new relationship with the hyenas were the one thing that made the remake worthwhile. That guy had an opinion (original is better because I like the original more) and then he went and found justifications to support that stance by finding the chsnges and framing them as 'bad'.

The new relationship between scar and the hyenas makes him a better villain"
All of them except Pete’s Dragon.  That one is actually good but no one seems to have seen it.  Unfortunate since all the others pretty much suck.

"Same reason I don’t want to go visit “my childhood house” which has been torn down and turned into a McMansion. I don’t want a fresh visual overplaying my real emotional memories. Maybe just certain types of people feel this way though because I know others can’t relate.

A Disney remake cash grab is never going to evoke the same emotions, so why would I even care to rehash the same plot line but in a worse way, dampening my experience and nostalgia of the original?"
"Heh, autocorrect is dumb sometimes... Ariel. Added it now...."
"Not at all. Melissa McCarthy has a bunch of mediocre to bad movies, but she also has plenty of good films and performances. James Corden is complete shit and an asshole. Not comparable at all."

Exec 2 - I keep telling, he’s 98 years old, and he’s dead.

 I mean he does do a fair share of voice acting.
"i think he can be hit or miss but he named his son Sebastian (not coincidentally, he’s named after the crab) and TLM is apparently his favorite, so i’m hoping his love and passion for it comes through. that + og crew returning + halle casting is what gives me hope that this won’t be as soulless as the other remakes. of course i definitely might be wrong, but TLM is my favorite so i want it to be great, i’m gonna hold out hope for now lol."
"I forgot they were redoing splash mountain.  Wasn’t that like four years ago?  Are they still doing that?  Hopefully it does come with a restaurant.  I remember the same criticism when Soul came out.  I wasn’t paying much attention to Disney cartoons when Princess & the Frog came out, so I don’t remember it then.  I get the criticism."
"Which is crazy they made this choice because if they didn't even want finn, a completely uncanonized character, to be a jedi having a black little mermaid means this film is gonna fail hard simply because china will not give two shits about it. Little mermaid is going to do really badly because the overlap of people I know obsessed with disney and racists is damn near a circle."

"and I have heard the very same criticism levied about disney interpretations of arab folk tales. 

You know, how aladin, when he is a thief, is several shades darker then when he is a prince? How it paints a very disturbed picture of society? 

What I posted to you is a very valid take on the perspective of genie. 

If you doubt any word that I say, read The Ebony Hors, and similar stories from أَلْفُ لَيْلَةٍ وَلَيْلَةٌ, ʾAlf Laylah wa-Laylah, or as it is better known in the west as One Thousand and One Nights. Just read those stories, and then tell me with a straight face, from the djinns perspective, this is not how he would view humans? because the original arab folk tales are wild. UI mean, I am german, we have the brothers grimm, we have some seriously dark shit in our folk tales of tolerable infant terror, but we have JACK SHIT when it comes to the traditional arab folk tales. 

Many of the accounts deserve a NSFL tag, and should only be consumed when drunk, and there are no children nearby. The original 1001 nigts is like 50 shades of grey, mixed with the silence of the lambs, on crack. ."
"I think that's a good idea, but it doesn't really address what's happening here.

Disney was making this movie anyway. That cart came before the horse. In doing so they made a decision to correct some of the companies past biases( which really have nothing to do with the story here, that's just the backdrop). It's not really about making mermaid movies. That idea can also happen, doesn't mean this one shouldn't too. This is addressing something specific with Disney, specifically.

People say it or write it and... actually I don't know wtf they think they're doing. On one hand, some people think they think they're pulling one over on us, like it's a secret handshake outsiders don't know about (which would be bizarre that every redneck was spontaneously supporting the same dude named Brandon). On the other hand, everyone knows about it and they deliberately yell it and write it for everyone to see so it's not like it's a secret anything. Even if they didn't know, it's not like a random shoe tap in a public bathroom stall. One google search and ""omg no way, these people that actively advertise hating Biden... don't like Biden?"""
"Wait, what? Where is this?"
They did copy the hair. The difference is lighting. They didnt really adjust color based on lighting in old animation. This scene is at night so the hair looks darker. It would look bizarre if it was bright red in a dim background.

It would be great if she was originally a black character, but she's not. I'd love for Disney to make some black mermaid characters, but changing your heroine undermines her original design. 

I personally don't care since these CGI reboot cashgrabs usually suck but just trying to elaborate on the point. You can absolutely be racist both ways."
"So if I rebooted Black Panther with a white guy, that would be A-OK?"
"Nah, that is just the defense used to shield this type of thing from criticism, and the people using it are gullible AF."
"Then make new IPs with other ethnicities, that would be way more interesting imo, new IPs to love, merch to buy, universes to deep dive into.  


Seems like a much better option to me tbh, becaue most of these remakes and reboots suck ass, regardless of the swapping and alterations, if they were actually good people might not think they were just swapping to shield themselves from criticism, like they are doing now."

"There’s a vast difference to changing an animated character to changing the colour of hair of a real actor.

I, as an example, have autism. A group that could arguably be represented more. If you told me that the were remaking Toy Story, but Buzz Lightyear has Autism, I’d be pissed. I don’t want my representation to be rehashed seconds. I want unique movies, with unique characters, who deal with the struggles and successes of their unique situations. 

I want movies with new characters that kids can look up to, without this feeling that they are only good enough for the same old stories round 2."
The casting crew thought so yeah.
Mommy the man is crying over a mermaid movie again
Sounds like someone didn’t read the original short story. Spoiler alert the little mermaid dies at the end. Disney has been retelling the classics since you were drinking through your sippy cup
Disney has been speaking in dollar signs in marketing everything towards white people for the longest time in case you haven’t noticed. It’s ok to not always be the center of attention.

My stance is that I want movie directors to stay in their lane. i am not interested in these motherfuckers idea of the story. Most of these stupid ass adaptions follow the same scheme and it makes them appear life-less and too driven to relay a underlying message. You dont change the skin colour of an already established character for nothing.

They are not creative, all they are is being liberal with their messaging that nobody cares for. Virtue signaling trash media."

you need access to the extension to *see the dislike count*. you can dislike it without seeing the number of dislikes.

&#x200B;

so your point that you have to be extra super racist to dislike the trailer because it requires going out and downloading something is way off base. Anyone can dislike it. the only reason we know the number of dislikes is someone took the time to download the extension and figure out how many there were."
Actually redhead erasure is a thing. Just some recent examples I can think of off the top of my head: Batgirl movie that got canned. Iris West in The Flash tv show. MJ (it’s not “Mary Jane” but come on) in Spider-Man. This one. An entire Annie remake a few years back. James Olsen in Supergirl. That’s just the stuff I’ve seen or shows I’ve watched myself.

"Well that’s dope then, making money off of racists is even better than shitting on them."
"It's been 14 years since the last Little Mermaid movie, and 30 years since the original, and yet the character is still very popular, so what are you basing this argument that there's no demand for a movie or that it'll bomb, other than looking at other live action remakes (some of which didn't bomb, even with bad reviews)."
"do you think *anyone* would be discussing the live action little mermaid remake if they had cast some redheaded white woman as ariel? 

nobody would give a shit, it would do just ok in theaters, and be on disney+ in 2 months.

I cant open reddit without seeing post after post about this stupid movie. and like I said, if the quality is poor, it will not be physically possible to express any negative opinion about it, and I really think that is by design. 

all that being said, i am rooting for this movie. I liked the original, this woman has a great voice, it stands a chance. I have kids and I have suffered through some pretty terrible movies with them, I really like it when a kids movie has some sort of heart. I will probably eventually see this.

unfortunately, what I see as a very transparent decision to drum up controversy doesnt bode well. And I will go into this movie thinking about that, hard to divorce this movie from this stupid internet fight. 

I will reserve any actual judgement until I actually have to sit through this. And the bar is going to be pretty high because I am not in the target audience."
I don’t give a fuck if they’re virtue signaling or not. Just watching the videos of little black girls being utterly thrilled to see the little mermaid portrayed as black makes it all worth it. About damn time.
"If I had to guess, because it’s a series and not a well established piece of Americana… and globally loved movie that already existed"

"It is true that most folklore in Africa and the Caribbean has their own version of mermaids- in Jamaica, they’re called River Mumma, and the legends of them are actually quite terrifying- supposedly luring people into the water with a ‘golden table’ from sunken pirate treasure, or drowning car crash victims and anyone who dares to enter the water around Flat Bridge. 

Anansi was usually a shapeshifting spider, though, from most Afro American and Afro Caribbean folklore."
was /s actually necessary… lol
"Just because people who don’t matter think it matters doesn’t mean it actually matters.

These are the people who unironically shout “go woke go broke” and then when the movie makes a billion dollars they just mumble some excuse and move on to the next batch of manufactured outrage.

They want to spend their lives being angry and miserable. I say let them do it, they’re fun to laugh at."
But here we are; trying to show people who hate this because of her skin color that it doesn’t matter.
This would actually be an interesting movie
They poop strings
In Denmark you better be white af in ages where no vitamin D supplements exist
">it’s the fact that theirs no explanation or rhyme or reason given by the show as to why there are different skin colors.

Why would they need to explicitly explain this, ffs?  This shit is insanity.  

The Harfoots are actually lore-appropriate dark skinned yet nobody is demanding an explanation or feigning outrage that some of them are light skinned. smh

There's no need to make skin tone any kind of issue at all for this fucking fantasy series.  Hell, the one elf that has racists all in a tizzy is actually quite light skinned himself.  Still ain't good enough for the racists, though."
">The black elf by himself, not a problem. The black elf on top of their portrayal of Galadriel, racist Irish stereotypes in the hobbits, a focus on character drama as opposed to myth building, I know this is a meme but the beardless dwarf, these errors stack up and build a clear picture. That clear picture is that Amazon couldn't give less of a fuck about what Middle Earth was all about and is only trying to cash in.

Horseshit.  It not being 100% lore accurate in every way is only being used as cover for the anti-woke sentiment being pushed.  Nothing is ever 100% lore accurate.  

The black elf is what sparked the whole criticism to begin with.  It isn't just some minor little side note.  It's the anti-woke crowd who has been behind all this.  Everything else is cover."
unfortunate that this is downvoted.
I am glad that GRRM is still alive and approved Black Targaryans himself so that others can't complain about it being against the lore or the author.
"I'm not saying it doesn't exist. But you acting like LotR and HotD have two completely different fanbases is completely disingenuous and simply false. If all those racists who judged a show purely based on its casting had chimed in on HotD as the ""racist"" who gave RoP a low score then it would have a similarly low score. Rather on Rotten Tomatoes it has a 85% on IMDB an 8.5 etc. You are simply wrong about this and you are pushing a line that Amazon sold you. This story here is pushing a line that Disney is selling in hopes to get people just to support this as an act of defiance against racism. We have no real discourse over tv or movies anymore, we certainly don't have reliable professional critics anymore, and a lot of it is because of this bullshit. It's the internet, of course there will be some racists but it isn't all not by a long shot."
"There are dark skinned cultures in the Middle Earth lore already. Instead of using a character from one of those places, Amazon decided to just turn random elves and dwarves black. It's bad story telling. That doesn't make critics ""bigoted sad sacks."""
">Do you see anyone complaining about back targareyans in HoTD? No, you don’t

Oh yes I have.  Lots."
">	Do you see anyone complaining about back targareyans in HoTD? No, you don’t. 

Lol you can’t be serious. Go into literally any thread in /r/television or /r/freefolk about that character and it’s full of highly upvoted comments from closeted racists complaining about him. The actor received a shit ton of hate DMs too."
"Every super hero?

Look at the marvel line up. Which of the main heroes are brown washed? All the top tier ones are white: Captain America, Iron Man, Hulk, Black Widow, Wanda, Spiderman (all 3 versions!!), captain marvel, Thor, Dr Strange, etc. every movie I can think of except Black Panther has had a white character as the main actor. And Spider Man into the Multiverse, but that was an animated film by a different studio, so I don’t give it quite the same weight.

On the DC side, Flash, Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman - all white. Aqua Man is Jason Momoa, so that one isn’t white I’ll grant you. Harley Quinn is white.

I genuinely don’t know what you’re talking about when you say all superheroes are being brown washed."
">Damn near every major superhero and is being brownwashed

This is basically a variation of the quote

""To those accustomed to privilege, equality feels like oppression""

Media is still dominated by white people(and men), but because there's slightly better representation these days, all you can see is 'black people/women have taken over!'.  

You're telling on yourself here."
"Only racists like yourself perceive things this way.

And yes, I feel comfortable calling you a racist given your active and regular participation in a sub dedicated to racism, r/ActualPublicFreakouts."
Ah yes. The people racially replacing white characters are not the racist. But those of us who point it out are the racist. Great argument. Maybe those Disney losers could spend their money energy better elsewhere?

Okay so bc upvoted comments aren’t talking about race that means the race controversy doesn’t exist? Come on man you can’t really think that.
"theres about 1.5 million of them, give or take the 90k that are hitting dislike at the same rate as the other disney remakes"

""Never have I ever"" is also a great show in my opinion with an idian lead role and a manly half-japanese love interest with a kind heart."
"Oh, unfortunately I'm sure it will be terrible lol. Imo all the live actions I've seen have been.

"Yes? The amount of Star Wars bedsheets, pijamas, toys, stickers etc you can sell to kids absolutely dwarfs the amount adults pay for a movie ticket. 

It is absolutely a children's movie. And I love Star Wars, but it's primarily a merchandise seller. 

Also they said 4-12, only you said 4"
"You could have gone with something like She-Hulk, which is clearly not for kids, but you went with a movie series that even the original creator said was for kids."
Disney bought Star Wars thereby proving that 30 years ago a childrens movie they made wasn’t aimed at children. Bit of a stretch.
"If they got tits, they can be milked, that’s all I know."
"But thats actively assuming they purposely did this with an agenda, is it not possibly, nay likely, they did an open casting call and decided she was the best actress for the job, regardless of her skin colour?"

"Howard Ashman, the man who ""gave a mermaid her voice"" said so. His contributions to the film are arguably the only reason that Disney animation still exists. So maybe the performance style he insisted upon for the character *matters*. 

I don't give a shit about whatever they'll hamfistedly do with *this* version of Ariel. They're claiming that this is a live-action remake of one of their most beloved films. The whole thing rides on her naivete and innocence. There's no way that any aspect of this remake will work without it. And no one will buy naivete from a voice that grown-up. -- And I'm still paraphrasing Howard Ashman here."
Or even at all similar physiology  as dolphins given the fish tail. Perhaps these mythical imaginary beings can be whatever we want them to be?
You really don’t see a decline in the quality of their content over the last 50 years?
"They recasted the Queen as black in bridgerton and another movie. So can a white person play Obama? 

I fail to see why the title of the movie has any effect to what colour the actor has to be. If race doesn’t matter of course"
"Nah, they're very much right and you're very much wrong."
Or just casting an actual singer.
"I’m not denying genuine criticism. I reiterated the point of my comment, if you don’t care to understand what I’m saying that’s your fault.

The whole reason this post has so many likes is because people are getting mad about her skin color and features ? Apparently commenting against that is “social spew.” If you think racism only exists when it’s blatant, you obviously never experienced racism."
Lea Salonga is great as a voice actress for Mulan but I highly doubt you could get away with a Filipina playing Mulan in a live action adaptation.
The little mermaid is fictional. She is still a character of danish folklore
"I can’t tell if you are agreeing with him that it’s in fact “a lot” or not.

Because a dozen or two isn’t a large number and a lot of these look like terrible examples.

I’d bet you can also fill up a long list of “black people being remade into white or Asian or female characters”

The outrage is fabricated here.  Those types of memes are exCtly how you get people to parrot “stats” when in fact it’s not statistically relevant and extremely biased"
"Literally your lot has to change the definition of racism, so you can actively try to push for discrimination."
"I honestly don’t see a downside, yeah.  They can still get their relative liked-or-didn’t metrics out of how many people have seen it relative to how many liked it.

And the racists might have to find healthier hobbies."
"Asians/native Americans fit the bill too, probably more so than black people if we’re talking about America."
"But why do I have to clarify myself? If I say I don't like for example the Beauty and the Beast live action movie I wouldn't have to clarify myself, but now in this case if I don't I'm assumed to be racist. That just seems wrong to me."
Victimhood?
"There’s no rationalizing with racism in America, unfortunately."
"Changing the race of Ariel changes the story too. Now the King will have to be Black, and her sisters will have to be Black. You seeing a pattern here?"
There also is a white Black Panther his name is the White Wolf but he’s literally Tchalas brother and has the exact same powers as him. In the movies bucky is the white wolf and they even mention it in the end credits of the first Black Panther. These people are all fucking stupid clowns.
He is literally named after a black empowerment group. Changing his race results in a completely different character

"But I’m not wrong, am i? 

This same controversy happened when a white dude played Aladdin in 2017. So this isn’t new."

A cross between modern day Egyptians and Israelis. Medium dark skin.
Is fictional a race?
"The character Ariel was first written and born in the 1989 film “The Little Mermaid”. That’s the story, that’s the character and story being discussed here."
"You can’t make the argument that Black Panther should be allowed because of its meaning, and then argue changing the little mermaid is ok because she “isn’t real”. Nothing about Black Panther is real. So stop with the “not real” bullshit. It doesn’t hold water.

Nothing about Black Panther should be changed, SIMPLY because it’s an established character and story line. Period…

Let’s not forget, that the majority of America agrees with me. Check the trailers dislike ratio."
"They could easily put Wakanda in Europe and makes the characters white.  There was plenty of imperialism and oppression that Europeans had to repel.  Ukraine is a good example.

“The Ukrainian Panther” starring Zelensky would be a killer flick."
"That’s the thing, it’s ALWAYS been a problem, even back when they cast a white dude to play Aladdin back in 2017."
"Jesus is portrayed as Sub Saharan Black in most African American churches. What’s your point?

Correct, that is why Black Panther was created and should remain the body of work as it is today. There should never be a Latino, Asian, etc version of Black Panther. Doing so is merely hijacking an established character and story. Which is the basis of my entire argument.

Just because there isn’t some “higher message” behind a character, that doesn’t excuse the changing of that character to meet some narrative. 

Speedy Gonzalez is an established character of Latino origin. He should NEVER be changed to be another race or suddenly make him a 2nd Amendment sympathizer. That’s not who or what that character ever was.

Which, again, is the bedrock of my complaint. Changing just for the sake of changing is absolute garbage."
"Fine, let’s remake Moana, and make that family White folks and see how folks react. You and i both know how that would go…don’t we?"
The vast majority of African American churches have Jesus represented as a Sub Sahara Black man. But he wasn’t. He more resembled today Egyptians. You have an issue with Black peoples portrayal of Jesus too?
"Ok, fine. A White person playing Storm from X-men?"
"You’re missing the point too. Did you know that movie made in India (Bollywood) are predominantly India actors. They use Indian actors to play people from every country. Why? Because that’s the predominant race in India. 

Japanese movies predominantly cast Japanese characters. Shocker, right?

Point being, EVERY country that makes movies “wash” their characters with the primary race of that country. This isn’t just a White thing."
Black Panther is a cartoon too. What’s your point?
"Nice dodge. You won’t answer, because you will prove yourself to be a “bigot”. Hypocrite much?"

"Oh yeah, tons of Republicans in positions of power here are idiots.  You've got my 100% full agreement there.  But the general voter base is rarely represented by their shitass leaders in the US, at least nowadays.  Lord knows Biden is thrashed by the party he's tied to every day.

Thinking that since a lot of Republican Senators, House members, etc. are partially braindead, then the main voter base is dumb too is an insult to a lot of good people.  Heavily inaccurate, too."

">Something tells me that casting Gal Gadot, who cannot act her way out of a paper bag, as Cleopatra was not the product of open casting lmao

But ppl can't have it both ways and then say to white ppl ""you are racist if you don't like a character or historical figure to be brownwashed""."
"That's not going to happen because the backlash is bullshit noise. Seriously...Disney filmed Cinderella with blind casting in 1997 and aired it on network television with Brandy (a black woman) in the title role. 60 million people tuned in...it broke records and was a huge hit. Greys Anatomy did blind casting in the early aughts, another huge hit. Hamilton... huge hit. Even Bridgerton, broke records as one of Netflix's most watched shows. There's literally no reason why a company like Disney would cater to racists and trolls when numbers don't lie. If they have a strong enough cast and give them quality material to work with the work will stand for itself. It literally will not matter that a few racists threw a tantrum at the end of the day when it's time to cash the checks."
"Oh i know “people” care about “race and representation”. Ive studied history, especially USA history. They cared so much that they didnt allow people of color on the early days of television just so that their viewers felt comfortable."

"Alright, I see now you're specifically talking about modern Disney movies.  As such, may I offer you Wonder Woman as an example of a modern Disney movie starring a lady lead that did well?  Or Black Panther for a modern Disney movie with a black lead that did well?

And when you're trying to make a statement about how x and y aren't given fair treatment, you're not making a generalist statement.  You're opening yourself, specifically, for examples of where x/y IS given fair treatment.  If you then go like ""oh, I was talking about how x and z aren't given fair treatment"", then you absolutely are doubling back on a previous idea or point.
Even if it actually was a generalist statement, so what?  Being all like ""you can't criticize a general statement for being wrong"" is just...dense.  Yes you absolutely can.  In fact, you usually should."

It didn't help that YouTube was among those corporations too.
This kicked into high gear when Stella Artoir published a beer ad that got onto trending with 15k views. The dislikes were just *chefs kiss*.
It's the only platform with dislikes... For a reason
"Basically every COVID 19 video was swamped with Anti Vaxx trolls and crazies, so it was contributing to the misinformation problem."
Nah its because every single video the white house posted for bidens first month in office the like to dislike ratio was like 1:10. They got rid of that shit real quick
"In other words.. ""don't be evil"""
"Yeah, because people aren't allowed to dislike things that corporations make anymore."
I don't think anybody on the planet buys it.
So why not have the like-dislike bar only appear after you’ve signed in and given your opinion?
"A simple google search shows that the inauguration speech was in January but the dislike count was removed in November. Remember, if you lie, you have to lie good unless you want to convince only gullible fools."

"Thumbs up/down is a user engagement metric, and videos with more engagement get pushed harder by the algorithm."

The explanation above says otherwise and from what I understand about technology it makes sense
Barely anyone has complained over Colrys Velarion most of the things I see are about how crappy rings of power is and how hotd easily outshines them.
"And the funny thing is there's non-white people in Middle Earth (Haradrim, Easterlings).

There's also Dark Elves but their appearance is never described."
Rings of power is genuinely ass and house of the dragons first few episodes are getting better ratings than game of thrones first few.
"Correct.

If the video has 100m total views, 5m from people with the extension and 50k people with the extension disliked the video, it'll show 1m dislikes."
"They disabled them in the API shortly after they stopped showing them, the extension makes an educated guess based on trends and dislikes from people who use the extension."
"LinusTechTips talked in a livestream about this, the extension is not accurate at all and showed what the extension thought were the dislikes and what the real dislikes were, it’s just making a guess with nothing to base it on"
"API access was removed a few weeks after dislikes were. From this point forward, the return dislikes extension is approximate. It uses plenty of data that it does have access to to give a reasonable value. If the extension says it has millions of dislikes, that video is very likely to have millions of dislikes."
"""YouTube is removing the ability to access dislike counts through its API starting December 13""  
  
And here is what the extension maker said:  
  
""This extension aims to restore power to users by using a combination of archived like and dislike data, as well as the likes and dislikes made by extension users to show the most accurate ratings."""
What kind of ‘data’ do they have? I have glimpsed over the source code and can say it is just a random algorithm that does not really represent a dislike. Please prove me wrong if you have the info.
"Only true if the self-selected sample of people who use the extension are equally likely to dislike a given video as the larger self-selected group of people who view the video.  That’s pretty unlikely, as people who care enough about dislikes to get the extension are probably people more likely to dislike things."
"The amount of people that have this extension is a percentage of a percentage, you’d be a fool in any field of work to try to extrapolate an opinion based on that"
"I'm one that uses that extention, and it's because prior to the removal of the dislike bar/count if you opened a video for something like ""How to clean your dryers lint trap"" (purely as an example) and you saw that it had 1 like and 25 dislikes, you would know that video probably shouldn't be trusted and you can move on to the next.

There are thousands to tens of thousands of how-to videos out there and being able to weed the bad ones out using the dislikes was a good way to make sure you were getting accurate information.

That's just one aspect of why removing the dislike button/bar was an anti-consumer decision."
As long as you admit why YouTube removed the dislike total showing then you can think whatever you want.
"Yes, exactly. Not only is it a very small sample, more importantly it is a very skewed sample. You probably don’t get this extension if you don’t go around disliking lots of videos. 

EDIT: the irony of this comment being heavily disliked is pretty funny. Possibly by people with the extension?"
And you’d be wrong because the source for that data is heavily skewed towards disliking themselves
"No you can't. This is a textbook definition of a skewed sample. The only thing you can do with this, statistically speaking,  is be more likely to make enraged racists feel self satisfied."
Yes I’m coping because I’m calling out an extension that doesn’t have direct data from Google as innacurate
"I domt think ive ever disliked a YouTube video, dont really like then either.

I just like to know what the community consesus is. I may still watch it even if its negative, but it is extra information I like to have"
"Do you really think people dislike a video because they can see the dislike number?? 

If they are more likely to press the dislike button then they probably didn't like the video in the first place. All the dislike number do, is urge them to press it. That doesn't change the fact that they don't like the video in the first place.."
"The extension came out before dislikes disappeared, so presumably they had time to calibrate for that."
You posted this 3 times as evidence but didn’t actually read it
"Linus tech tips ran a test. And found on larger more successful videos it was relatively accurate (within a few percent), the bigger the video…. The more accurate its extrapolated data was"

"Not sure about the remake, but original TLK Scar doesn’t give a shit about the hyenas and doesn’t really hide that fact. He spends the first minute of Be Prepared calling them morons, and Jeremy Irons blew out his voice on the line “You won’t get a sniff without me!” because it was so forceful and commanding (Jim Cummings had to finish the song, you can hear the singer change haha). Scar ruled the hyenas through intimidation and false promises, was cruel to them the whole time they followed him, and died to their jaws the second they saw he was weak and unable to deliver."
I think Karate Kid 3 is one of the best examples of camaraderie in villains. Terry Silver genuinely cares about Kreese's wellbeing and offers him anything Kreese wants. With no quid pro quo. Now the rest of the movie is about a billionaire bullying a high school kid. That's fucking stupid. At least they gave a reason for it the best they could in Cobra Kai.

“There is only one man I think about
There is only one man I long for

Last night I saw the conscription notice,
The Khan is issuing a great draft –

A dozen volumes of battle rolls,
Each one with my father’s name.

My father has no son old enough to take his place,
I, Mulan, have no elder brother.

I’m willing to buy a horse and saddle,
I will take my father’s place in battle.”

She buys a fine steed at the east market;
A saddle and blanket at the west market;

A bridle at the south market;
And a long whip at the north market.

At dawn, she leaves her parents’ home
and camps beside the Yellow River before dusk.

From far away, she cannot hear the sounds of her parents calling for her
Only the rushing waters of the Yellow River.

She leaves the Yellow River at dawn,
And reaches reach Black Mountain before dusk.

From far away, she cannot hear the sounds of her parents calling for her
Only the cries of the enemy cavalry in the Yàn hills.

She traveled ten thousand li,
She flew over mountains and through mountain passes

The sound of a war gong pierces the air,
The winter sun shines brightly on her coat of steel.

The general dead after a hundred battles,
The warriors return after ten years.

They return to see the Son of Heaven,
Sitting in the royal court

He unrolls the scroll of merit a dozen times
Giving hundreds and thousands of rewards

The Khan asks Mulan what she desires

(Mulan replies)
I have no need to be promoted to a prominent position

I only ask for a camel that can travel a thousand li
That can take me back to my hometown

Her parents hear that their daughter has returned,
They welcome her at the entrance to the town.

When Elder Sister hears of Mulan’s return,
she stands in the doorway wearing a beautiful dress

When Little Brother hears that his sister has returned,
He sharpens his knife to slaughter a pig and a lamb.

(Mulan speaks)
“I open the door to my eastern chamber,
And sit on the bed of my western chamber.

I take off my military robes
And put on my old clothes.

I sit in front of the window as I comb my long flowing hair
And look into the mirror as I apply makeup

I go outside to see my comrades
They are all shocked and astounded.

“We traveled together for twelve years,” (they say),
“But we never suspected that Mulan was a woman!”

Most people tell the gender of a rabbit by its movement:
The male runs quickly, while the female often keeps her eyes shut.

But when the two rabbits run side by side,
Can you really discern whether I am a he or a she?""

Now how was the Disney movie more accurate to the poem again? Because you seem full of shit."
"Iceberg ahead - thats why i think they decanonized the thrawn trilogy, its basically a story of a foreigner from a fringe world assimilating into an existing empire and their values entirely ... Do you think that would spark joy in the eyes of the CCP

"Exactly! Can’t say I’m a huge comic book guy, so my background on miles is limited, but the spider verse miles movie is awesome, and my kids love watching the Disney+ spidey series with Peter miles and Gwen!"
That’s exactly my point is that it’s mostly adults. As a nine-year-old I didn’t care that suddenly Cinderella was black. I was raised on the original from the 60s as well. Absolutely loved it and yet it did not cross my mind once to question the race. Because honestly most kids don’t care about the race until a hateful adult tries to make them care about it.
It even **tells** you and people still can’t figure it lmao.
Didn’t get it! Thanks for testing :)
wsb has that affect.  I think it actually does kill braincells.

"That's not easy to do well, especially not when you're planning bright lights and other stage issues. Anyone can do a lousy job of any color, and a skilled stylist can do a respectable job. But movies have more going on. I read about camera doubles once, and I was blown away. There's so much time spent standing on set while they fix lighting and other stuff that they'd use up the contracts for the actors. They hire people who have certain matching features."

Proof please.
You think Disney came up with the story?
"Here's a hint...

No one fucking cares. We can tell the same *exact* story whether she's white or black, or brown, or yellow, red, doesn't fucking matter. The color of the skin plays exactly zero part in the plot. The only people that care this much are racists that don't want to admit theit racist but this still upsets them and they just can't vocalize why in any manner that makes sense. 

P.S. BIPOC care when their good characters arw white washed because they’ve been relugated to villians, monsters, criminals, gangbangers, and every other negative sterotype under the sun for the entirety of entertainment. It's not even close to the same and you know it."
But how does it impact the plot in any way to have her be black? I'm genuinely confused. Her whiteness was never a plot point. It's never discussed. It truly does not matter.
"So if it were up to you all remakes would be exactly the same as the ""original""? We'd have the same movies and shows every 10-20 years with not one tiny detail changed. This movie your honor, in the original this character had freckles!!!"
"It’s an asinine argument, imho. This constant “what about the reverse scenario” is childish. I see people using this on other subs about male victims vs female victims. Same juvenile argument. IMO 

Rebooting BLACK Panther with a white person doesn’t make any kind of sense to argue. Making a new movie called WHITE panther and casting a white person would make sense. The Little Mermaid title doesn’t include a race defining word, e.g. The White Little Mermaid or The Black Little Mermaid. IMHO, this is a poor stance to take. 

Casting a non-white woman to play a red headed reboot shouldn’t bother one single person. I saw the trailer and thought the hair department could have kicked the color up a notch or two, because it looks orange to my eyeballs. But that’s the end of my opinion about the appearance actor. Her singing voice sounds amazing!

But who the heck *really* cares about a mermaid’s hair color???? So dumb!

I saw a video yesterday of a little girl watching the trailer and she got so excited because Ariel looked like her. It brought tears to my eyes. Why can’t we talk about that? The sheer delight for that child to identify with a lovely little mermaid. Grow up people and open your hearts! (This is to no one in particular and I’m not trying to fight with the person I’m replying to)"
"no.  but they’re not rebooting a story about a race of white fish women, so they can do what they like."
"Or as a native-american. The character was created with a design in mind. If the writers of the reboot didn't even cared about the original design, are we really going to expect them to care about the more nuanced details of the character?"
"Yes, the 1.5 million people disliking the trailer of a children’s movie is totally reasonable and valid. Makes so much sense."
"New characters should always be created. I completely agree. But traditional and archetypal stories are always being remade and adapted. 

There have been great retellings, but the majority of remakes are often terrible compared to the originals. But that has little to do with the ethnicity of an actor, but more the formula behind productions. I completely agree on this point. 

We lose when the balance between business and storytelling gets too out of whack."
"See, you just gave the best reason to read it!  She doesn't in ANY way excuse racism, so you clearly have a misunderstanding about the book.  The best way to remedy your misunderstanding is to read it."
"I misspoke. Obviously, in those instances, it's racist to put a human in. /s"
"You're forgetting the most important thing and I will repeat it: *the status quo in Hollywood has always been white characters.*

Race swapping African folklore (i.e. from black to white) is not the same thing as race swapping the Little Mermaid (i.e. from white to black). When 90% of the characters in any Hollywood production are white, there's only one direction to go to make it really reflect our current cultural makeup. And that's introducing more non-white characters."
"Then it wouldn’t be black panther would it? That would be a new character with a different story, because the history of the Asian continent and the African continent are not the same. The story would deal with different themes entirely and I wouldn’t have any issue with it. That’s a great example of a story where the character’s race and setting context matters. Now how does Ariel being black change the story in any way?"
"Then it wouldn’t be Black Panther, get it? The story is fundamentally tied to the setting and race of the characters. You’re gonna find it tough to find an equivalent poc role because most of the time, poc weren’t given roles unless they HAD to be of a certain race. If a character’s race didn’t matter, then Hollywood gave the role to the “default”, meaning white people. Now things are finally changing and roles where race doesn’t matter are starting to be accessible to everyone as they always should’ve been"
What does changing her race change about the movie?
"thats where the old saying ""dugongs dont make it right"" or something like that came from"
"Oh Jesus, now you're going to tell me how the Stellar's Sea Cow *really*  became extinct."
"Yeah but if I have the choice between a Dewgong and a Vaporeon, I know which one I'm choosing."
The original version of The Little Mermaid is Danish. This is based on the film version that was created by an American company. A version which only drew inspiration from the original tale. Was the Danish version also a musical with a black coded talking crab? The whiteness of the original author isn't really relevant here. This isn't Mulan.
"Itll be weird is they put a different race for Mulan, Merida or Tiana. I think those stories are race/culture dependent. But its a MERMAID. Mermaids don't exist, which is why its so weird people are caught up on a fictional creature's skin color."
"I'll not speaking to him necessarily. But the decisions on what stories to tell were, what actors to hire and in what roles were. Hell when they initially decided to even have a black character appear on screen it was just a white person in makeup for years."
"The thing is, it's not as if one is tied to the other at the exclusion of everything. Disney is making remakes, regardless. So I'm happy to see a little more diversity this go round than the first. It's not too the exclusion of making new movies with new characters. They're cashing in on nostalgia. It's nice to see that things have changed, even if the comments indicate not by much"
"I mean it's Disney doing remakes. It's just a thing. Complaining about it being unoriginal is pointless, that's kind of the point, and  it's for kids anyways."
"I was absolutely sure you’ll say “make a story about a mermaid but with human lower half, and fish upper half”."
"A little pandering makes me feel warm and fuzzy. I wish my grandma had lived to see it. Such a stark contrast to the world she was born in, grew up in, and raised a family in."
[The fury over the whitewashed casting of an upcoming Chinese epic lays bare some of Hollywood’s worst business impulses in a global economy.](https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/08/what-is-matt-damon-doing-on-top-of-the-great-wall/494090/)
"I'm not talking of Africans in the Western world. I'm talking about elements from the actual continent from Africa. That's how sheltered you are when you automatically think of that.

&#x200B;

Don't give me the names of Samuel Jackson, Will Smith, Beyonce, or Black Panther. Name me any actor, singer, character, director, song, or fairy tale from the continent of Africa NOW! Off the top of your head, something from let's say Nigeria, or Mali, or Kenya. Without Googling anything. Something on the level of the media in USA or Europe.

&#x200B;

Progressives live in the bubble of their arrogance and think that replacing Europeans in their own folklores and fairy tales is going to get rid of racism. I think the real racism is ignoring the richness of the culture they want to promote. What? Billion dollar company Disney couldn't hire actual African scholars and scriptwriter to adapt and tell a tale from actual African fables?"
"Actually, blade was originally created black. He had a different custome, but that was it. You might be confusing him with someone else."
" Maybe because the movie was inspired on that story instead of being an adaptation, and a lot of it was made specifically for the movie, so they still put effort in creating a semi-original story. Also, don't know where you have been, this debate exist since before 2020."
"if you are okay with changing the race of a character, only when they are of a specific race, you are racist. Simple as that"
"Not sure if you never knew about Alan Scott, Hal Jordan or not, because for awhile John Stewart"
"Trying to be sarcastic, and failing, doesn't help you in nothing."
"Whoops, sorry."
"What I mean is that the blue eyes imply that she likely looked Danish, since HC Andersen was Danish. She definitely didn’t have red hair, for instance. 

If they “stayed in their lane” they wouldn’t have added the crab sidekick, given her a name nor the happily ever after. None of that is in the original. She was also naked and didn’t swim with a shell-bra - look at the statue based on the original in Copenhagen for how we Scandinavians visualized her. 

Disney made massive edits to the story in order appease American sensibilities and “virtue signal” the values of the time. E.g. in the original the prince has a bunch of female slaves (read: concubines) that the mermaid competes with for his affection. Disney has always adapted stories to the sensibilities of the time, because they are targeting kids."
"> you need access to the extension to see the dislike count

I don't know how you're not understanding what that guy is explaining to you. YouTube has shut off access to the dislike API. You need access to the extension to add to the dislike count (that's shown in the extension). Anyone who doesn't have the extension but still dislikes is essentially doing nothing because only the creator and YouTube can see those dislikes."
"Tldr; the extension cannot view dislikes only make estimated guesses. If you dislike it while you have the extension installed, you contribute to that guess and make it more accurate. If you dislike it without the extension, the guess is unchanged"
"I LITERALLY JUST POSTED PROOF ON HOW THE APP WORKS TO “guess” THE COUNT.

DO YOU KNOW HOW TO FUCKING READ????

The extension has ZERO ABILITY to pull data from YT.  So yea, I can go dislike the video,  but the extension has zero insight into my dislike UNLESS I HAVE THE EXTENSION INSTALLED.

FUCKING IDIOT.  GO BACK TO GRAMMAR SCHOOL.

ONCE AGAIN - THE EXTENSION DOES NOT KNOW OR SEE YOUR DISLIKE IF YOU SONT HAVE IT INSTALLED.  WITHOUT THE EXTENSION ONLY YT KNOWS THE TRUE COUNT.

Edit: go look at the extension - the code is public and you can see how it works.  The owner maintains a DB that stores all the dislikes it captures."
"If you're going to ignore what I said, then answer for me, then why ask any questions at all?

But what I actually mean is that I now think that you're not only racist, but also dishonest.  

Meanwhile, **you have a problem with a fucking mermaid's skin color**, and are comparing it to a **actual, real native American!** Get a fucking life!

Edit: I like how this guy gives a long response, in first and second person, but blocks me so I can't see it.  If someone else with a brain could respond for me, that'd be great.  And for the record, if this guy wanted a conversation, then his prior comment wouldn't have involved him responding for me rather than asking me my opinions.

Also, ""racist"" and ""dishonest"" aren't insults.  They're accurate descriptions of some people, based on their behavior."
Lmao racist - you gotta develope a sense for nuance at some point my man
"all the live action remakes bombed and are universally disliked - most people STILL say that despite all the other drama around it, because they just dislike their live action remakes THAT much"
"Amen brother, honestly, seeing little black girls happy and smiling because of the little mermaid makes me melt, and thats all that truly matters in this case in the end 

But still, the identity outrage bait has to stop asap"
The little mermaid is probably more famous than lotr you ape
"Or a death metal opera. Little mermaid and Cthulhu Mythos themed. With little happy songs containing invocations to the Eldritch Gods beyond.

Do you honestly think they are listening/give a f?
"Again the only coral described is the castle walls, and an iceberg would be extremely unusual for the Caribbean. 

Though slavery is a good point, I’m not sure if the author was pro-slavery or something or had intended the story to be set in an earlier time."
"Melanin makes hair black, pheomelanin makes hair red. Bright red hair makes a lot of sense since she has no melanin to cover up or darken the red hair. And she would likely have lots of pheomelanin. It is connected to another gene that allows red haired people to generate vitamin D more efficiently, we can even generate it with no sun which other hair colors cannot. That would be a perfect trait for living deep underwater.

But even if she had no melanin or pheomelanin, she still wouldn't be black. She would be albino instead. Albinos don't have any melanin, but their skin is white and their hair is white, not transparent."
"Hahah wow. What is your argument here? That these are actors and in reality black kids HATE seeing people like them represented in films? That’s your argument? And you think you’re right? Jesus, read the fucking room."
"> I’ll tell you 100% I’m not racist, but sacrificing lore and storytelling for a random black elf or dwarf is just corporate pandering

You realize just saying ""I'm not racist"" doesn't grant you immunity from being labeled racist, right? lol

Very, very few racists believe they are racist, let alone are willing to acknowledge it."
Oh they're still trying.
Unpopular opinion: if Tolkien didn’t want black characters then fuck that guy.
"It's not all, but the racists are absolutely the main force behind the extreme negativity.

You seem to have a history of trying to downplay this:

> Why is it this group of bigots always bubbles to the top of the conversation. Why is that ALWAYS the discussion

This is about She Hulk.  

You just seem incapable of understanding how many bigots and 'anti-woke' folks are actually out there, huh?  This shit is a problem.  Look at something like Gamergate to see how this shit has built up to what it is today.  It's not some insignificant minority.  This is a problem getting actively worse."
How does it affect the storytelling in any way at all?
Go ahead and link a comment if its that common
"""racially replacing"" is not a term that people who are not racists use, think of or consider. the fact that this is a thing you both made up and are mad about is what makes you a racist. 

To normal people, this doesn't even enter the brain as a thing."
"Nope. I just think the racism isn’t as popular as people like you make it out to be. There are racist criticisms, but they pale in comparison to people annoyed with the film for a variety of other reasons."
"Aren’t they? Look at the top ten grossing films this year - you’ve got Batman, Thor, Chris Pratt as a dinosaur wrangler. Oh, and Maverick made like a trillion dollars"
this has to be sarcasm.
"That’s like saying African Americans are represented in (insert African country here) movies.

I’m speaking about Asian American representation in American media specifically."
"I’m staying positive! Lin Manuel Miranda is usually dead on, and the preliminary CGI is *much* better than I was anticipating. The live action Cinderella was pretty good, hopefully this one follows that example and not Beauty and the Beast or Aladdin, both of which I found virtually unwatchable."
And all of those movies were shit on pretty hard.
"No I didn’t, nor did I suggest that I did. 

It’s *disingenuous* to compare that to a white person being cast in a POC role as it’s not weighted down with the same loaded context of oppression and marginalisation.

Not to mention that I suspect in a majority of cases the people generating the outcry over Ariel being black in the new movie stayed quiet on Scarlett Johansson in Ghost in the Shell, but that’s speculation.

ETA some genius left a comment telling me that I’m a racist and then blocked me because they were seemingly terrified I might actually respond. Grow up."
I talk about both in my first paragraph for the avoidance of doubt. *The Little Mermaid* is a story with more history than one movie.
"My mother still insists I’m not truly red haired but strawberry blonde, or, if she’s feeling cultured, “titian” lol."

"Oh no, there’s plenty of that, but I notice the same hints of people showing their absolute ass in an unnecessary manner that I’d never seen before until Barack Obama was elected. It’s the same boo boo, different toilet, but the sentiments are all the same. People don’t act this foolishly over DiSliKiNg a TrAiLeR."
"So, is Howard Ashman working on **this** version of the movie?  I'm just checking, since you claim that he's the one that is deciding how this character is going to be portrayed.

And literally every one of their live-action remakes has been different from the original.  Some of them massively so (101 Dalmatians, Alice in Wonderland, or you could even include Hook in here).  

It really seems like you just want to watch the original, and shouldn't be commenting on this one at all.  Go watch the original, you'll love it.  Ariel is perfect in it.

Meanwhile, in just a few months, you can actually watch this movie, and find out if it's any good, instead of judging a production by 10 seconds of a song.

Edit: BTW, ability to sing doesn't mean that you aren't naive.  The actress is 22.  There are plenty of 22 year olds that are naive and innocent.  If you think that the ripe old age of 22 is enough to be definitely worldly and experienced, then I'm guessing that you're 21."
"Well I assume mermaids share skeletal structures the same way whales have hip bones and flippers are just weird arm, and spines all flex the same way. But now I do wonder if mermaid frat parties are just goldmines for ambergris. And what’s the deal with Ursula because that ain’t no mermaid. Does she have three hearts and a beak under all that mess? I hope the new movie answers these questions."
I simply don’t consume enough Disney content to notice. But overall I see a pretty noticeable decline in all media over the past 25 years.
Unless Moana is 51 years old I don’t.
"Obama was the first Black US president and a person who is still alive. The Little Mermaid is a cartoon fish person. 

Also, examples of Hollywood casting white people as POC:

\- Emma Stone, *Aloha*, as a half-Hawaiian half-Chinese woman  
\- Ben Affleck, *Argo*, as a Mexican-Italian man, and Cleah DuVall, also in *Argo*, as a Japanese-American woman  
\- Natalie Wood, *West Side Story*, as a Puerto Rican woman  
\- Tom Hardy, *Dark Knight Rises* (fun fact - Bane is actually Latino in the comics)  
\- Tilda Swinton, *Doctor Strange*, as an Asian man  
\- Everyone in *21*, who were all white actors but based on real students who were Asian-American

So it's not exactly like Ariel is the white race's one chance at being on the screen. I think we can handle 2 Black Disney princesses."
Bridgerton is set in an alternate reality where the king married a black woman. There’s no historical accuracy and it’s not trying to be accurate
"“I fail to see how the title of the movie has any effect”

Soooooo why did you choose The Black Panther? This is an absurd conversation. New movies and shows don’t erase the originals. Get over it."
" >being remade into white or Asian or female characters”

Take for example Ghost in the Shell (2017) which was speared, roasted and dive bombed because of it. Unfortunately the arguments of ""It's not a real person"" and ""It's a robot"" did not help."
It’s a lot when there’s barely two dozen ginger lead characters to begin with
"Uhhhhh..... who's ""my lot""?"
"But if we’re talking a Caribbean reef in the age of sailing ships, that’s somewhere like the Danish West Indies or Haiti, areas like that with a lot of black people at the time."
Ahhh yes. The rampant racism in America. It’s EVERYWHERE!! I can’t walk down the street without hearing the n-word.
"> Now the King will have to be Black, and her sisters will have to be Black. You seeing a pattern here?

It’s hilarious how the people most offended by the casting haven’t been following the production at all. You’re wrong."
Once upon a time (Disney tv show) had a black king triton and a white Ariel. Surprisingly you don’t seem to care about that. (And btw way you racist fuck it absolutely did not change jackshit about the story sometimes people are just black.)
"The actor playing Triton is white.  But in any case, changing their race doesn't effect anything either.  The sisters had maybe 2 minutes of screentime in the original."
">Changing the race of Ariel changes the story too. Now the King will have to be Black, and her sisters will have to be Black. You seeing a pattern here?

What scientific evidence do you have that imaginary half-fish beings inherit racial characteristics from their parents?"
"And that changes the story how? Not at all. The story is a sea monster that wants to walk on land and marry a prince. Race is irrelevant. You clearly can't separate your bigoted ideals from reality.  


I've seen your post history. You are a bigot."
"Yup, and then there’s the pink one… but that’s another situation"
And making him Pink… well that’s a whole other genre
"Damn, racism is real…brutal…"
"Come on, you didn’t have to say *that*"
"you *are* wrong though.


black panther’s whole story is about the issues of modern day black life, and contributes to the understanding of human oppression and how to tackle that issue.


the little mermaid is about how if you try your best, you can succeed no matter how big or small you are.


you couldn’t be *more* wrong."
"Yes you ARE wrong. The fact that you can’t see how obviously wrong you are after people have explained it is pretty sad.

And the dude who played Aladdin in the 2019 film (get your dates right if you’re trying to make an argument) is literally named Mena Massoud. How is he white?"
You’re literally choosing examples of characters where their race and ethnicity play an integral role in their stories. Like jfc you’re just making yourself look dumber with each comment.
"Pocahontas was a real native American woman. Wouldn't really make sense to make her white given her family was native American

Making storm a different race wouldn't make a difference to the story"
"Right, but it’s located in Africa which is a real place. 

Atlantis is somewhere under the sea within swimming distance to shore

It’s funny that you completely ignore the valid point of my post and focus in on the part that doesn’t matter. Maybe because you’re laughably wrong"
"you’re right, it shouldn’t matter. so why are you so adamant that she should be white?"
"You're the one who thinks it matters, not me. I can't answer for you.

Are you unable to answer?"
"It’s not that she _should_ be played by a black actress, she simply is. The role was originally cast for Chloe Grace Moretz, a white woman, but she backed out of the role. Halle Bailey has an incredible voice, so clearly Disney thought she was a great choice for the role. It’s not like they sought to make a black Little Mermaid, it’s that they didn’t restrict the casting to white people only."
I’m going to need you to define what you think race is if you think someone of a different species can also be an established race.
"Out of curiosity, why do you think her race is white?"
"Yeah. Exactly.

All these dudes losing their mind over black Ariel unironically think of Jesus as a white dude."
"Yet he's plastered everywhere as white and pasty.

Maybe give the black Ariel thing a fucking rest, eh?"
He and Ariel would both share it if it were.
"They just NAMED her Ariel; the story is based on a fairy tale from the 1800s that’s based on tales that go back to Norse and Egyptian times. They’re not changing the skin color of any person, but a fucking mermaid. This is nothing but racism."
"No, you’re literally ignoring the point. The actual history of the character of Black Panther makes it matter. This is not the case history of the character of Ariel. These two situations aren’t identical. Context matters. You want to ignore this so you can pretend you’re not racist.

YT trailers aren’t the “majority of America”. The internet is full of terminally online idiots like yourself that will dislike it because you’re a racist dipshit that wants to hide behind a nonexistent argument because you can’t admit you just don’t want a back person playing a character.

I honestly hope you grow up and get the help you need. Just taking a quick look at the communities you post in and the comments you post, you need it. You’re not worth engaging with. You disregard the response to your dishonest question due to either stupidity or dishonesty. Maybe both. Not worth wasting time on you anymore."
"Except I don't see the same outrage with any of those whitewashed movies at the same level as this one. What is it about this one that is particularly worse, in comparison to the whitewashed ones? Isn't it the same situation?"
Source? Am black and grew up Catholic. I highly doubt the vast majority do.
"I’m not personally clamoring for it but I’m not going to throw a fit.

If the vast majority of superheroes weren’t already white, it might be more compelling to see black characters recast this way."
We are talking about The Little Mermaid made by Disney in the U.S. not every movie in every country.
"Do mermaids, who live in the ocean, have a race? Is the skin color of someone who isn’t human therefore doesn’t have a race relevant to the plot of a movie? I’m pretty sure the black panther wouldn’t make any sense with a white lead since the movie is literally fucking about Africans. But you’re mad about, a movie remake, casting someone with a slightly darker complexion, and you don’t see that maybe you’re view of race has gone too far? When you want a remake about a a fairytale to include the original artists choice of skin tone. Even thought the new movie is not a cartoon. You care, this much. You’re so silly"
It wouldn’t make sense for the story or the character if they suddenly made Black Panther white. It’s not equivalent
"Firstly, Ariel is not an iconic ""white character."" So put that stupidity back up on the shelf.

Secondly, this is all happening within a specific historical and cultural context. Not that I'd really expect somebody as insecure as you to understand that. 

I'm a white dude. And I'm telling you to please just shut up and work on your self-esteem."
I mean isn’t that what hollywood did for years? White people in black face and Asian? I swear your question literally was the founding of cinema lol.
Too easy.
"Those positions are mainstream Republican positions.  You can't say Republicans are anything else than who they elect.  The bizarre forced birth obsession and insistence that they won the last election despite zero evidence to the contrary are both nuts, and any votes for people who support either of those positions validates Republican leaders for holding them."
"So people are upset when the 5% of prominent BIPOC characters in media are portrayed by yet another white person, and not upset when BIPOC are cast in just one of 95% of roles historically played by a white person? Well yeah, because that makes sense lol"
"So you’d agree with me that Disney are basically racist? 

They’d rather not risk creating a black original character and lose money (because they’re racist) but rather remake a previous film and replace previously white characters with black ones 

It’s some progress, it’s nice to see childrens face, especially black girls, light up, but the whole background behind it - racism"
"Wonder Woman isn't Disney. Captain Marvel or She-Hulk or Black Widow are better examples. And people talk shit about those for ultimately the same reasons they downvote this trailer.
And Black Panther didn't do well because of the sort of person who downvoted the Little Mermaid trailer. It was specifically important to black people, who generally aren't as angry about the casting.

You were not criticizing my statement for being wrong, nor did I ever say you can't do that. You took a statement literally when it wasn't intended to be literal, and thereby made an argument against a point I wasn't actually making. And that is what I said. This ""dense"" comment seems to be motivated by bitterness and a desire to fight, coming entirely from your end rather than anything I said."
I have no doubt that you can't deal with a lot of things regarding black people if you can't recognize anything about their experience.
Idk what you’re talking about im saying its wack that Disney is giving racist bands a platform
Lmao Disney dick rider gtfo

That’s Mr. The Edge to you :p
My coworker exclusively uses edge and bing. I’ve asked her why and she said she never thought about it
Call me crazy but i like edge chromium better than chrome
You don’t even know me.
"I switched to edge last year, it's actually way better than chrome, and saves me way more ram for when I'm gaming and using my browser at the same time. I also switched on my android, and it does basically the same there too."
Being almost identical to Chrome isn’t great…
“It’s rewind time” is still the most disliked video ever

"There’s disliking things and then there’s the sheep behaviour of bombing.

Those taking part in the latter have no idea whether they like or dislike the thing being bombed, all they know is they want to fit in with their chosen crowd and so join in, even when what’s being done isn’t helpful to anyone, or worse is completely toxic behaviour (like a bunch of racist turds whining about a fictitious non-human character being portrayed by an actor who isn’t as pasty as Putin’s tits)."
Some people in these comments do.
True. It has its purpose.
"Still is a bit useful for hiding public opinion as you'd need to install an extension to view the dislikes. Imagine tech-unsavvy people just going, ""Oh hmm nice likes!"""
"I wouldn't call it unreliable, but it does sound like there's some guessing involved. 

According to the [extension's overview](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/return-youtube-dislike/gebbhagfogifgggkldgodflihgfeippi), it only counts likes and dislikes of people using the extension. I assume they then apply that like/dislike ratio to the visible like number on the video to get an idea  of the likely number of overall dislikes. Like an exit poll or what have you."
Everyone disregarding it doesn't even entertain the idea that it could be actually... worse lmao
"I missed that part, you’re correct."
The complaints about color blind casting is what’s driving Rings of Power’s ratings.
Everyone has an opinion. I’m just glad that two first rate shows are available. I’m tired of shows about lawyers.
"I think maybe the original is more popular, every girl reads it. 

But if you like redheads more, that’s cool. I’m a redhead, so that’s cool. 

Go in peace internet stranger."
"You base your opinion on the opinions of others who until recently haven’t had an alternative in order to determine which they like better?

Have you considered being your own person and forming your own opinions at any point?"
"So you only like what’s the most popular adaptation on the character at the time. Because based on that if it became most popular for a black Ariel you’d be okay with that. Cause historically it was a blonde haired girl, then redhead, and now black."
Your source is having watched some tech video?
"> It uses plenty of data that it does have access to to give a reasonable value.

Even if they do have archived data from before the dislikes stopped being shown, archived data obviously wouldn't exist for videos posted after that point. All they can really do is make an educated guess based on people who have the extension, and as other people in this thread have pointed out, there are lots of instances known where it's been way off."
"[Their website](https://www.returnyoutubedislike.com/faq) explains the basics of how it works. They do not claim to provide a perfectly accurate ratio, but for the most part, it is able to provide a reasonable value that will give the viewer a proper idea of the feedback on that video. Of course, there can be exceptions where the count isn’t very accurate, but they’re presenting about the best data possible given their restrictions. It’s not a “random algorithm”, idk what “source code” you were looking at to draw that conclusion Lmao"
"It’s probably unlikely their ratio is IDENTICAL, but it is likely that the ratio is similar. If the ratio is close to 1:1, it’s likely the real ratio is 1:1, if the ratio is largely positive, it’s likely the real ratio is likely positive, if the ratio is negative, it’s likely the real ratio is negative.  It is a completely reasonable tool to use to get an idea of the feedback on a video. It is NOT a good tool if you want a perfectly accurate number, but that isn’t what most people want. When I look at a like/dislike ratio, all I care about is the general ratio. I don’t care about the exact numbers and I’m assuming most don’t either. This extension is perfectly viable to provide that information."
"A fool, or a statistics major.."
"I don't think they should have removed dislikes, but I have zero faith in the extension. It's just an educated guess, and you have to acknowledge that the type of person to have the extension is without a doubt a niche grouping vs the whole/general audience.

Reporting on it like it means anything for a video like this is just, ironically, clickbait. They know creepy weirdos like The Quartering and his viewers are all up in arms about a children's movie they weren't going to watch and there are also tons of us who are engaged either by being annoyed at these neckbeards (when really we should just ignore them) or are otherwise just attracted to any online drama to weigh in on"
"Generally, the first few comments will provide me with enough info on if I can trust it, there is almost nothing humans like more than correcting others. That and the algorithm works fairly well unless it’s an incredibly niche topic

I get why folks wish it hadn’t been removed, even if I am not overly bothered by it."
YouTube removed the dislike because it didn't serve their commercial interests anymore. They could have just tried to curb brigading but probably didn't want to deal with all the cries of censorship or being unfair so it was easier for them to just do away with it.
*rough estimate*
For awhile the plug-in actually just pulled the dislikes from the source code or something but I know they weren’t going to be able to do it that way after awhile
"I mean there isn’t really evidence that people utilize this extension are inherently any different than any other YouTube viewer. If there was a good comparison data, you could apply the correction to the model, perhaps there is a viral popular video out there with published dislikes and the extension estimate for a comparison"
Yes… you’re trying to make excuses for the fact that people don’t like it the remake
Whether my initial understanding is right or wrong is irrelevant. It's posting actual information instead of he said/she said.
"Yep. Sorbo was perfect in those roles.  My first indication he was in real life a moron, was when I found out he ruined the last seasons of Andromeda.   The first 2 seasons of that show were glorious epic Sci-Fi.  He couldn't understand it, so he fired the showrunner  and made it Hercules in Space... but worse."
"All celebrities are cunts, most are just good at hiding it."
"Same. At least we still have Xena, lording over him. Haha"
"Never watched Karate Kid, what one earth was the billionaire doing?"
There is no live action ATLA movie in Ba Sing Se..
"Oh it must’ve been a nightmare, thanks for calming my mind"
Much like how people keep mentioning this Dragonball evolutions movie that doesn't exist
Is that all of it? Where is the part about her becoming a concubine (or committing suicide)?
"Exactly why I said the the Mulan movie (Live action) was closer to the real source material.

Maybe I should have prefaced “live action” since you had trouble inferring what I was referring to.

LMFAO you seriously getting that riled up over a Disney movie? Show me on the doll where Disney touched you."
Myths and Legends is Jason and Carissa Weiser. Mythology and Tales will both be Parcast.
"I know right. It's so annoying. People just don't read, they just go in blind panic mode instantly.

Even when you point to the sentence that says how you can stop it it still doesn't click for them.

What happens next time you feel suicidal though? How in the world will the reddit bot reach out? I'm worried for you bro
"Even if someone is being a racist shit or whatever, I still don’t send them the message. Only use it on suicidal people, because I believe they can report the message and get you banned after X amount of violations."

"But Little Mermaid came out in 89 and Peter Pan came out in 53, or is there another version you’re referencing? Before the cartoon Ariel would’ve been blonde as in the original story, unless I’m missing something"
"SAG actors contracts stipulate 12 hours between shifts. Technicians contracts do not. 

Some productions have 2 or 3 crews working at the same time. 

Child actors have much shorter days and can also require schooling.

All of these things mean a double can be useful."
This reminds me of the Martin Freeman bit in Love Actually where he played a stand-in on porn sets.
The little mermaid is Danish folklore from the 1800s...
"Not sure why you're assuming that. I was talking about their specific character 'Ariel' that they depicted in their movie and have copyrights to. That original designed character in their specific movie, regardless of the source material."
"HC Andersen did in the 1800s  


Its danish folklore ffs."
"Except some of us do care. So my redheaded kids don’t deserve to have someone to associate with? Growing up I had this ONE character to say “hey, she looks like me!”.  I don’t give a fuck what race they made her.  We’re 1% of the entire population and we keep getting replaced."
Her race is irrelevant. The audition was race blind. They did not set out to cast a specific race. She was chosen as the best out of the auditions.
"Exactly... if it changes nothing,  why make a change"
"It has nothing to do with the plot. I was talking about Ariel, the established **originally designed character** that Disney owns. When a design is established and becomes iconic, changing it like this **makes no sense**. So I **agree** with you. Why did they change it when it doesn't matter? Would people be upset if it was the other way around? (They would)   


I'm talking about her, as a character, as a design that is well established and existed before this. Now there will be Ariel and Black Ariel, and I'd rather just have Ariel and Anne the *original black mermaid character* by Disney who is her own person. Does that make sense?"
"That's what I'm saying, exactly. 

When race is a plot point, I'd defend the plot for certain. But this argument is merely based on the fact that people liked it when they watched it before, and they literally think that someone with brown skin is *very very different.*"
"If its racist one way, its racist the other way, simple as."
"So they can reboot a story about a race of fish women, but I cannot reboot a story about a fictional super society?   


Please do elaborate."
"Just either make something new, or make sure the adaptation is 100% solid, because lately its been neither."
It's  a shame they won't read it because they're so... fragile.
"Either way, going by your statement  


""If a character is written a particular race, then it's racist to put in a white character for their spot.""  


Then race swapping is racist."
So revenge swapping? How does that help? Isn't the point to learn from mistakes? Not repeat them?
"Hey guys, did you know that in terms of male human and female Pokémon breeding, Vaporeon is the most compatible Pokémon for humans? Not only are they in the field egg group, which is mostly comprised of mammals, Vaporeon are an average of 3”03’ tall and 63.9 pounds, this means they’re large enough to be able handle human dicks, and with their impressive Base Stats for HP and access to Acid Armor, you can be rough with one. Due to their mostly water based biology, there’s no doubt in my mind that an aroused Vaporeon would be incredibly wet, so wet that you could easily have sex with one for hours without getting sore. They can also learn the moves Attract, Baby-Doll Eyes, Captivate, Charm, and Tail Whip, along with not having fur to hide nipples, so it’d be incredibly easy for one to get you in the mood. With their abilities Water Absorb and Hydration, they can easily recover from fatigue with enough water. No other Pokémon comes close to this level of compatibility. Also, fun fact, if you pull out enough, you can make your Vaporeon turn white. Vaporeon is literally built for human dick. Ungodly defense stat+high HP pool+Acid Armor means it can take cock all day, all shapes and sizes and still come for more"
"It absolutely is relevant. How do you think Disney, or any company adapting a work, settle on a design? They look at the source. The author was Danish and therefore described characters like white people. It's no different than anywhere else in the world. Black authors write prominently Black characters just as Asian cultures write stories with Asian characters and so on."
">I'll not speaking to him necessarily. But the decisions on what stories to tell were, what actors to hire and in what roles were

I don't think it's weird, surprising, or bad that when a region is made up of a majority of people who are a thing, that they tend to tell stories based on and around that thing.

>Hell when they initially decided to even have a black character appear on screen it was just a white person in makeup for years.

Absolutely. Not so much in film though, but for a long time in plays and theatre in general, men tended to play women as well."
If a little pandering makes you feel warm and fuzzy then you must walk around with a raging hard-on 24/7
"What the fuck does any of that have to do with a story calling for ""European mercenaries"" and Matt Damen being one of them?

This doesn't address my comment in any reasonable way"
">I'm not talking of Africans in the Western world. I'm talking about elements from the actual continent from Africa. That's how sheltered you are when you automatically think of that.

My comment was 2 sentences long and you somehow weren't able to read it properly? Where did I say anything about the western world? Seriously, you're out of your mind."
"I think this highlights another glaring problem, most African Americans do not identify with Africa, they have been in America for almost 2 centuries. Brought here against their will entirely and had their cultural identity erased. And now they’re simply Americans, who have grown up with the same fairytales and bedtime stories you have. And now you say “go represent your own culture!” But this is a part of their culture."
"You’re correct not sure why I thought that. The point still stands, comics characters have their features changed frequently because the character isn’t usually defined by their ethnicity or sexual orientation or whatever. Different writers can take them in different directions or can introduce new individuals to take up their mantle like the introduction of miles morales as Spider-Man or Jane foster as Thor"
"White has been the default for centuries and so virtually every major character in pop culture is either white by default or distinctly not white. Opening up those gates so why doesn’t have to be the only default doesn’t seem like such a crazy thing, whereas erasing the few distinctly non white characters would have a very different feel"
Do you think equal opportunity quotas were racist
That's the joke
It makes me laugh. Which makes my day better
"The original story sounds way more interesting. 

I get that I am most likely not the target group of the movie and wont be watching because of it. 

My problem lies more with it being a trend that seeps into already well established stories with loyal fan bases that expect an adaption close to the original source. 

Your last paragraph encapsulates perfectly why I hate most of todays movies and tv shows even though I was the biggest entertainment shill a decade ago. Every piece feels like it has to appease a very shallow mainstream audience and only the a couple shows a year show me how TV could be, when entertainment ranks above messaging."
"you are having an argument with everyone about  something nobody is saying. you need to stop, breathe, and read. you have misunderstood how the change to dislikes work and have made assertions based on the misunderstanding that dont hold water.

someone: You don't have to download an extension to dislike it. 

you: YES YOU DO

Me: <explains that you are misunderstanding, you don't need the extension to dislike a video, anyone can. so saying someone had to download the extension to dislike it is inaccurate>

you: rants in all caps about how the dislike counter extension doesnt count accurately"
"It works on simple math. Even if you don't have it installed, the accurate count will be extrapolated. Ie let's say a youtube video has 100 likes. 11 of those people have the app installed. 1 of them disliked it.  The extension calculates the value from simple arithmetic:

  100/x == 10/1

So x=10

Assuming an unbiased distribution of users, the extension will be accurate. And obviously, the more people using it the more accurate it will be.

"> all the live action remakes bombed and are universally disliked

You do know that this is stuff that's easily looked up and verified, right?  Do I need to provide links, or can you use Google?

* The Jungle Book was both a box office and a critical success (massively on both parts).  
* In fact, the Jungle Book was also done as a live action remake in 1994, which was both critically and financially successful.  
* Pete's Dragon was a lesser known movie (for both versions), but was a significant critical success, and a modest box office success.  
* Cinderella in 2015 was another critical and box office success.  
* Beauty and the Beast is another with rave reviews, a high audience score, and the biggest financial success of the ones I've listed so far.
* And then you have the critical failures that still made a ton of money (which is really all that Disney cares about), Aladdin, 101 Dalmatians, Alice in Wonderland, and The Lion King.  BTW, these were all big enough to get a sequel or spinoff film (2 of these are still in the works). They're also 3 of the top 5 movies on this list for box office draw, including #1 (people really wanted to see the Lion King).  

So I'm asking again, what are you basing your argument on?  What you just said doesn't fit reality.

Edit: I do like the insta-downvote for providing actual evidence..."
That’s what I said you worm
Really doubt he would have had an issue. He refused to work with Nazi leaning publishers back in the day when that was acceptable. From everything I've read he would be against these anit-woke clowns.
"If there was a story about the aztecs and some of them were randomly white, that wouldn't seem weird to you?"
"The race swap is absolutely the main reason the movie has gotten this controversial. If people were just critical of it due bc it’s a Disney live action remake, then the film would be similarly criticized as the others are. None of the other movies were this dogged on and there is a large visible outcry against the race swap. This is coming right after the same controversy regarding House of the Dragon, which people are largely loving but that show was attacked bc of a black character."
"The new batman is seen as a masculine man? Really? I did see the movie but I don’t see how you could walk away from that recent batman with that impression.

Thor, I’m going to pretend you didn’t think about this one and just ignore it. I hope muscles aren’t all it takes to be considered masculine in your worldview… Thor is absolutely not ‘masculine’ in these movies. Taika Watiti does not write or direct masculine male leads.

A lot of comic book movies on your mind. I struggle to see a lot of masculinity in these marvel movies but to each their own if you think that stuff is particularly exemplary of masculine male leads.

Maverick is definitely in that category, a call back to the masculine/macho movies of the 80/90’s. And the studio had so little faith in it Cruise agreed to very little pay up front trusting in its’ success. Make no mistake, people still like that kind of thing but Hollywood simply isn’t making much of it these days."
"Well, then you are sadly right"
I do generally like Miranda. Hamilton remains my shit. Fingers crossed. I'll watch it if only to  give it an extra view and piss off the racists.
"> Not to mention that I suspect in a majority of cases the people generating the outcry over Ariel being black in the new movie stayed quiet on Scarlett Johansson in Ghost in the Shell,

Do you think it's hypocritical to believe one is okay while the other isn't?"
"Just wanted to remind you that you’re a racist, be better"
All leads to crab.
"Then why wouldn't they just target the very loud white demographic who has a problem with this casting in the first place, by casting a white actor?"
I wasnt even stalking I was curious to see what they were posting
"Yeah they do.  Have you seen any YT Rewind controversy when it came about?  People can shit themselves over damn near anything.  It doesn't mean they're racist. 

For example, annoyances with mediocre live action remakes being blatantly cranked out to get some easy cash is a solid reason to dislike the trailer.  Hell, some people fucking love TLM, and I can easily imagine them not being happy over such a major redesign, for no observable reason.

Jumping to racism as the only reason for someone liking or disliking something is just...a bad idea.  Especially with little investigation into the thing.  Don't devalue the damn term by throwing it around willy-nilly."
"If Miss Bailey is right for the character they've written for her, then that character isn't Ariel. They've made an entirely different movie about a mermaid who wants to experience life on land, not a remake of The Little Mermaid. 

But that's been their track record with every other remake thus far. They've all been completely soulless cash-grabs, this one won't be any different. I certainly won't be seeing it under any circumstances.

Bit of a shame that they'd do Mr. Ashman like that though, after the way he poured himself into the character."
These are all great points. I'm also wondering if a human jellyfish hybrid is gonna show up played by Megan Thee Stallion shaking all that jelly in my face. I'm desperate to have this answered.
"Yes, every 5-10 years Disney deigns to give us a morsel of timeless content otherwise discerning audiences will wash their hands of them. The *original* Disney movies were banger after banger though. If you can’t see that then you must be young."
Thank you. My energy dissipated pretty quickly with this one.
Lol right? They fail to see how the title of the movie has any effect yet specifically choose iconic Black people or characters whose race is intrinsically tied to the plot/their lives.
"But that outrage was because of the location.  It was in poor taste and deserved SOME of that hate for the casting decision.  

This, however is a red herring or straw man logical fallacy (using ghost in the shell - because the outrage was with cultural appropriation - not a swap of skin color for an American classic film)"
"Thought we were talking about character of Ariel and the idea of being an enslaved minority outsider. That's very far from what Ariel is. Her father did not enslave her. She made her own choice to exchange her voice for legs.

It's actually a messed up love story in which the daughter in pursuit of blind love for a stranger, resulted in her father losing his kingdom at one point. If you want a darker take from the story, that's the angle. 

&#x200B;

Not poor Ariel being a ""slave"" who has less people commanding her than Cinderella, less restriction than Rapunzel, less political duty than Jasmine, less sexism experienced than Mulan. Her suffering of losing her voice is the consequence of her exercising her freedom, which is something that can't be said for the suffering of Aurora or even Snow White."

"Because of the last question i asked…

Why does it matter so much that we have to change it? Does race matter or not?"
"No, I’m saying it DOESNT and we shouldn’t change her race “just because”. It’s people like YOU that think it’s ok to change the race of a character."
"You were the one that claimed her race was mermaid. I simply corrected you. 

Just as tree frogs can be different colors. They may be a RED frog, but frog is their species."
"Because i saw the 1989 cartoon. What the eyes see, the mind believes. Crazy concept, i know….

If you wanna get real specific, the cartoon character “Ariel” was drawn as a teenage, Red Headed White girl. Even her love interest is a white dude."
Seriously I agree with you lol I don’t know how people don’t realize that there are movies going back to the 80s and 90s where the race of the protagonist was changed from the original.  This is not a new concept.
Seriously it’s getting ridiculous

"I have a problem with two things:

People changing an established character, and people caring so much about race, that they feel the need to change that race."

And something I suppose you're unaware of is that a LOT, arguably most, people vote based party affiliation and what they've skimmed from the news.  People voting those dipheads in mostly aren't the ""I'm going to thoroughly research my ___ elect!"" sort.

Also, as party elections go, different regions and districts win over others.  It's not a flat election straight to the end, it's kind of like a Karate Championship.

"Fair point, WW ain't a Disney movie, but its success compared to Captain Marvel, Black Widow, and She-Hulk's relatively less success is largely due to how WW is a great movie.  And CM and BW just...aren't.  Haven't seen She-Hulk, but it has a internet bait intro to my knowledge, and that'll make a lot of people dislike the movie to begin with, regardless of party.

That still leaves Black Panther as an example of a Disney movie starting a black person that was well liked.  Your statement that it didn't do well is just FLAT wrong.  The movie is jerked off in high critic circles, and online, it has a LOT of people who were all like ""this us the shit, this is peak Marvel"".  It sold real well, too, but most every Marvel movie does tbf.

Also, I just remembered Wreck it Ralph.  Penelope is a central character in that movie, and yet you don't see much in the way of ""all my homies hate Penelope"" online.  Hell, I know it's not Disney, but Soul was pretty liked, and that starred a (initially) black dude in the movie.

Your only point was directly connected to that statement you ""didn't intend to be literal"".  Of course that's what someone would target if they disagreed with it.  You gave them no other choice.

Might I ask where that bitterness and desire to fight comes from?  Because as far as I can see, I've been trying to prove a point you've been deflecting with incredibly weird justification this whole time.  Desire to debate or argue my point, sure, but I don't think ""bitter"" or ""wants to fight"" quite work here."
You just keep changing your argument. Lol
Nah. But feel free to use that when you can’t tolerate diversity.

"Fair enough, seems legit"
Hmm… quite strange…
"I use Edge, Chrome and Firefox.  

The only one I dislike, is Chrome.  I feel that is the 'pushiest' of the three.  

And I hate going to Google.com with Edge, because of the stupid, ""You should be using Chrome, because it's the best"" popup.

That doesn't make me want to switch, it makes me want to avoid Google.com, which I do.

You're not crazy."
"Correct, I do not."

"Yeah they did a pretty good job manually deleting dislikes up to that point (No, i dont give a shit that snopes says they were spam accounts)"
Go back and look at the ratios on white house videos..
But you’ve put right there in your second paragraph what they dislike. That’s not a valid reason to hit the dislike button?
I tested it before on videos I have access to and it was over estimating by over 8x.  A video with 100 dislikes for example this extension said 967.  So it’s garbage.
It’s also just unwatchably boring imo
*one* first rate show
Isn’t she a black woman with red hair in the new one? I’m not entirely sure because I will not pay money to Disney. They are an evil corporation
Looking at his comments you should know that the guy knows nothing about the extension and is just talking what he saw on a LinusTechTips stream
"Assume that the people using the addon are a random sample of the population. See how many people using it liked the video, scale known dislikes based on that.

So if there's 100K likes on the video and the extension users have 1K likes and 50 dislikes, you know that dislikes are 5% of likes. Extrapolate to full data and you get 100K likes and 5K dislikes.

To note, I don't know how it actually works, but that's one way that has **massive** problems starting from the fact that people who use the addon are not a representive random sample of users, and that extrapolating data 100 times over from a single data point is suuuper sketchy."
The website mentions it uses archived data. The API was disabled almost a year ago.  In my opinion their data is made up.
"> It’s probably unlikely their ratio is IDENTICAL, but it is likely that the ratio is similar.

I don't know on what basis you're assuming that it's likely that the ratio is similar. I would be *very* surprised if the kind of people that would use this extension are a representative cross-sample of YouTube users."
"
>	It’s probably unlikely their ratio is IDENTICAL, but it is likely that the ratio is similar.

I highly doubt that it is similar. As a general rule of thumb, anything requiring user agency and not totally and completely random in statistics is usually thrown out for being unreliable. This is why call-in phone surveys never work. The people who do want to share their opinion are almost always overwhelmingly negative, and that same concept can be traced back to this app, where the abysmally small number of people who actually care about downloading it are very likely doing so to downvote other videos."
Is it that similar though? Wouldn't those who are interested in dislike-bombing a video be the ones that would be most incentivised to use it to weight the estimation in their favor? By massively reducing the sample to mostly just those that use the extension every vote cast within that group has a much bigger effect on the ratio shown than back when everybody was locked into the same system.
I kinda doubt it’s 1:1 in this situation. As a rough generalization I think tech savvy people that would use the extension tend to be more progressive/liberal. A group of people that will less likely downvote this particular video.
It's not exactly an unbiased sample size.
"Yeah it had nothing to do with the fact that ideological and political content that YouTube’s leadership supported was getting absolutely ratioed (New presidential administration’s content, etc)… C’mon."
"""I interviewed people at a Democratic/Republican convention and found that 95% of people there planned to vote for the Democratic/Republican candidate. Therefore, I predict that the Democratic/Republican candidate will get 95% of the country's vote!""

(Take your pick on which to read it as; I decided to include both so as not to seem biased.)"
I think it can be easily argued that someone who wants to see dislikes on a video is also someone who dislikes video because they think it matters. I rarely dislike videos and have no interest in seeing them either.
"The extension reports about 3 million installs in the chrome web store, honestly it is more than I imagined, but Youtube reports 2.1 billion active users per month meaning the ones with that extension, even if all were active in a given month, are a really small minority compared to the regular users. Whatever their motivation was to install it, it seems that is something not shared by the larger userbase."
"I’m not trying to make excuses for anyone, all I’m doing is calling out the data from which the extension gets its dislikes from as biased and thus should not be taken into account"
"Except you also said that after your interpretation it was from the website itself, which is misinformation at this point.

“https://www.newsweek.com/return-youtube-dislike-browser-extension-google-chrome-firefox-1654339

Pretty sure this is still correct, and the dislikes is from the website itself.”"

If you were smarter you would see the movie deviates enormously from the poem. Stop complaining about it ya baby. Nobody cares which version of a children's movie you liked more."

Im sure the marketing department spent plenty of money for you to believe that.
"If we're going with that angle, then why not make a change?

The OG Little Mermaid will always exist. No one is going to take that away. You can hold on to your SO important white fish-woman in that. Hallie Bailey happens to be an excellent singer, so she'll be in the newer version."
That society is located in East Africa
"if you’re so smart, do it.  They own the property. they can do with it what they like.  just don’t buy a ticket.  That’s about as much involvement as you’re capable of manipulating as a scheme to hide your indignant, racist overstatements."
"Fantasy species and human ancestry are different types of ""races"" with different issues. 

I don't think we need to pretend that every character who has ever been portrayed one way must be portrayed that way. When it's integral, then I absolutely feel that ""swapping"" is racist."
"I didn't say anything about revenge swapping. And I didn't refer to the black Little Mermaid as a ""mistake"". 

The point here isn't about learning from mistakes – the point I have been trying to make is, for the third damn time, that THE STATUS QUO IN HOLLYWOOD HAS ALWAYS BEEN WHITE CHARACTERS. And what's happening in recent years is the effort to make it more diverse.

If you don't agree, then just say so and go talk to someone else. But don't twist my words around."
"If your all for it, why are you against it here?"
"How can it have the same themes when the themes are directly tied to Africa’s history? Do you think every colonial story is just interchangeable? Black Panther is inherently tied to blackness, if you remove it, it’s not Black Panther. Ariel’s race on the other hand, has nothing to do with the story. If you want to make a counter example you have to pick a black character whose blackness isn’t related to the story. Like, idk, Michael Jordan in Space Jam maybe? It’s really hard to find an example, almost like black people were systematically barred from roles unless the character *had* to be black or something. 

There are white roles tied to whiteness. Atticus Finch can’t be separated from his whiteness for example. The Godfather has to feature an Italian American family, that’d be a hard sell if they weren’t white. It’s not like there aren’t any white roles. Ariel just isn’t one of them"
"Do they though?  I almost guarantee you that none of Ariel's hairstyles or dresses would have been worn in 1830's Denmark.  Not to mention, were there tons of drag queens in Denmark in the 1830's?  Because Ursula's design was famously based on Devine, the American drag queen.  Is Ariel a traditionally Danish name?  No, it's not.  Do any of the characters speak in Danish or with at least a heavy Danish accent?  No.  These films aren't interested in historical accuracy in any area of their design, so I fail to see why race should be the one big exception."
"Yes, in the original work that would've been relevant. I'm saying it's not relevant here because it's not a 1:1 adaptation of the original work. It's an adaptation of the version Disney created which already takes major liberties with the source material. If the Danish influence was that important you wouldn't have environments looking as they did in the film or a crab with a carribean accent.

 Disney already made up a bunch of stuff when they created the animated version, including character designs. All they've done here is alter one aspect of one of the characters. That aspect being her skin color because it's not important to the story. 

They've done this before with their properties. The Broadway version of Frozen doesn't only hire white actors nor is the Broadway cast for Lion King exclusively black and so on."
My doctor's tell me the swelling will eventually go down
"Because people were outraged over a non issue just because the person was white. 

You’ve pointed out why they SHOULDN’T have been outraged, I’m pointing out they were outraged over a race."
You're giving me the runaround because you have no knowledge of African folktale or media. Typical Woke pretender.
"While characters can change frequently, i see that the core of many characters, including design, tend to remain one way or the other, even if details vary. Legacy characters are another story, as they are not the same individual, yet though i would argue that they are a bad way to create diversity, as they don't allow the character to stand as his own, always staying in the shadow of the other.

I'm gonna respond to your other comment, and, if i may ask, we can continue the discussion there, so we don't have two discussions at the same time."
"I am not too familiar with that universe, but yesterday someone commented that people were upset they chose an American actor for Blade for the movie. You may have been thinking of that."
"The thing is that, black characters, or characters of different races than white, do exist, and can be adapted, or even better, created, in order to show diversity. But thats not whats being done, they are just raceswapping white characters, which, to me, show that the people in favor of this only see legitimacy in white characters, instead of original characters of different races."
"Its sad that the only way that you can think to show black characters on the big screen is to change white characters, instead of showing actual black characters."
Ah. Wasn’t to sure as sometimes my random comic knowledge isn’t well known lol
And only shows that you have the mentality of a child.
"Adaptations will always change with the times, otherwise there is no point in a remake. The values within the stories will also change depending on the target audience and values of the times. 

E.g, check out this Danish adaptation, which tries to be very true to the original. It still takes certain liberties, like erasing the slaves from the story, because that just doesn’t fly today. 

https://youtu.be/gsRVLZID4zE

And beyond this, there are many other adaptations (Russian, Japanese etc) that were made before Disney’s and that change the story to fit their culture and values."
"No, once again you cannot read.

YES - YouTube still has a dislike button.

YES - they now don’t show you the count

YES - there is an extension you can download to see the dislikes.

These are all things I DO NOT REFUTE.  These are the facts to this point.

The water is muddied when idiots like you come in here and say you don’t need the extension to dislike - because THATS NOT WHAT IM FUCKING SAYING.

I am saying that the DATA this extension presents is NOT ACCURATE AT ALL.  Because for it to count a dislike it needs to SEE the dislike.  Google does NOT allow people to pull the dislike count from the API.  

The only way for this extension to show “the number of dislikes” is if it is counting them (via people with the extension installed), and some other things it does to tweak those numbers.

It’s literally in the fucking extensions documentation.



So now we have the baseline established….  This is where it may get hard for you because it involves some logic:

Since this extension can only count dislikes from people it can see hit the button….  It means for your dislike to be “counted” in their database, YOU MUST HAVE IT INSTALLED.



You know what, I’m done.  It’s like I’m trying to explain basic math to my dog.  In and out."

No but I think it’s disingenuous to then hold the other up as the proof for why you’re correct.
"Because thats the minority, white people are the minority on this planet - disney just cares for profit, if they see a PR opportunity like this outrage they make bank and they know it - when preventing such outrage is making them bank they just do that -

"And then immediately used it as your retort. This is semantics, regardless."
"Okay but you’re also ignoring the blatantly racist things being thrown around social media about it  in all your arguments, which doesn’t seem very sound in an argument against *checks notes* racism"
"Guess what, they're making a different movie.  It's a remake of The Little Mermaid.  Sebastian will be a bit different. Flounder will be a bit different.  And hopefully Ursula won't suck ass like McCarthy does in every other role.  That's how remakes work, same...but different.  

And if you've determined ahead of time that you won't be seeing it, then shut the fuck up.  I'm sorry to be that blunt, but whining about a movie that you not only are prejudice against (and you 100% are, even if it's not based on race), but refusing to see to even confirm your prejudice is the peak of fucking stupid.  

And frankly, I find your last line to be insulting to Mr. Ashman.  He poured himself into a character that was so successful that 30 years later it's still inspiring a new movie.  That's amazing, and frankly, you should be ashamed to say that it is anything other than amazing.  

Meanwhile, you should probably look up the Disney remakes, some are shit, but others are great (101 Dalmatians, the Jungle Book, and Cinderella were all pretty damned good).  This one might be, or it might be the next Pinocchio."

"Right, the Atlantic Ocean borders North America, South America, Africa, Europe, and Antarctica. The Atlanteans could be from any of those places if their origin even came from land whatsoever. Let’s not forget Asian mermaids and a Jamaican lobster are in the original alongside European castles. It really doesn’t matter what race Ariel is at all. Her red hair was her defining trait and she still has that."
Point to Atlantis on a map
"it doesn’t matter, she’s a fish. why does it matter to you?"
"You're saying her race matters and should he preserved, not me.

Like I don't really care if a mermaid is black, white, asian, etc. You do. Enough to be angry about it. So I'm asking why it matters. Why does Ariel being white matter to you?"
"You know she's a cartoon character? There is no extra effort involved in ""changing"" her race, because the casting process is the same regardless.

You just can't accept that a black woman with an excellent voice was deemed the best fit for the role by the casting team. YOU'RE the one making it about race.

Also, representation matters. Black people exist. Get your head out of your ass"
"Ah, so you think that a red tree frog is a different race than a green tree frog. Do you think that a red lizard is the same race as a red tree frog, do all the red animals know each other?"
"But Disney artists and designers made that all up, right? If you've read the original source material, you'll know the entire fucking ending has been changed - which totally *killed* me when I learned the real story as a child and I started trying to hug and kiss sea foam.

But is there anything in particular that makes you apparently vehemently desire that Disney stick to their interpretation of a centuries old story, from 33 years ago?

>What the eyes see, the mind believes. Crazy concept, i know….

I mean, it's pretty wild given we're talking about fictional characters. You don't also believe in cartoon mermaids just because your eyes see them....right?"
"Me.

"It does when a major part of the debate is one party arguing in bad faith. Pointing out instances where that isn't an issue in prevailing culture helps to contextualize the 'outrage' over one race-swapping instance versus another.

Completely disagree. Either be consistent with your logic or stop commenting.
It’s based on a tale. You are mad about a cartoon character being a different shade. Sorry the white shaded fish person little mermaid means so much to you.

"“People caring so much about race they change the race” 

You’re basing Ariel’s race off of her skin not race? They didn’t stare her race. So a tan white person couldn’t play Ariel? Boom not to sound cheesy but you’re argument was just destroyed with that one simple nod to your fallacy"
"No, you only care when they change the race. They change facts about characters in renditions all the time. It’s pointless to even claim a character has been established when a new person is recreating the story. Btw, they never, ever claimed Ariel was European. People are free to cast who they’d like, they’re not casting a cannon, eauropean mermaid as a black girl. They casted Ariel, who’s race hasn’t been stated, as a lightskin women as opposed to the previous white skinned Ariel’s. So?"
"No it doesn’t…in black panther, you’re talking about a reclusive nation in central Africa. The whole plot of the movie depends on killmonger wanting to arm black communities around the world with wakandan weapons to fight back against oppressive, largely white, governments. Changing that necessarily changes the story. It also poaches a character that has been a key source of minority representation for decades.

Conversely, ariel’s race has literally no bearing on the story whatsoever. Furthermore, I feel incredibly confident that there are no white mermaids out there who have been clinging to Ariel for media representation since ‘92."
"No, she's a Danish story and was originally green."
"black people can have red hair too lol? doesn’t mean red-haired people have to be white, yeah ariel has red hair but the whole iconic thing about her is that she is a mermaid and her hair color, not her skin color."
"Dos her skin color and hair have anything to do with her identity, personality, struggle, or plot? Is it mentioned in relation to any of these things in the original Disney movie by the main character or supporting characters?

It's not.

And that's why it can be changed without any noticeable difference in any of those things, thereby keeping the spirit of the original movie the same. 

The only difference is in the audience reaction, like yours, which is based on pure nostalgia, and a nonsensical adherence to race and skin color that is not needed, and only exists to please your desire for seeing something you loved as a child stay the same. Whether the roots of that are based in racism or something else I don't know, that's something you have to analyze yourself."

"Correct, YouTube’s API was disabled. Until it was, the extension was perfectly accurate since it pulled straight from YouTube itself. Now since that is no longer an option, they track the likes and dislikes of anyone with the extension installed as well as the  visible likes of a video and give an estimate as to what the dislikes are. As I’ve said many times before, the values are no longer absolutely 100% accurate. But they are not random."
"My dude we aren’t doing statistical analysis and experimentation on something that’s going to change humanity. We’re tossing out a mildly accurate value to give a reasonable sense of the feedback of a fuckin YouTube video.

"I doubt that. As long as we're generalizing here, I think the type of people to use this extension are more of your hate-filled 4chan/kiwifarms nerds. 

Like I wasn't a fan of the dislike button being removed, but I didn't care enough to download an extension to show me some unofficial estimate to validate my negative feelings towards random internet videos.

"Wow, that is a very skewed opinion.  What basis do you make this on?  People largely downloaded the extension because they felt they were being given a filter when they never asked for one.  Users want to see what the ratio is on videos to help weed out the nonsense.  Tutorials that are horribly made will get downvoted, clickbait videos get downvoted, and youtube took that away.

The argument that you make, ""it can be easily argued"" - yes, it can.  But the argument is false and baseless, and solely made on a personal opinion."

"Sure, but if you are going to bring in the type of logic you used for your previous argument, then it applies here as well.  


So if I took African folklore and made it all white, that would be just fine and dandy? Because The little mermaid is Danish folklore..."
"You're misinterpreting my comment. My point was that she's white in the original tale because the author was. So when Disney adapted the story, that carried over. Not much else did as you pointed out, not even the name. But because it carried over, the imagery that Disney created, that of a pale white girl with vibrant red hair and bright blue eyes, became THE definitive version of the character. 

I imagine few have read the book, most people could likely care less about it. But when you talk about the character of Ariel the imagery that comes to mind is what Disney created. The new actress has none of those descriptors so it makes sense that people are mad about it. I think if the first images shown from the film had some blue contacts and a brighter shade of red for her hair there wouldn't be many complaints."
"Im not exactly talking about the original work itself. Moreso it's influence on Disney's interpretation of that story. I think everyone can agree that the original has next to no culture relevance in the states and Disney's version is the standard. 

I don't care about the little mermaid or who plays her personally, but I do think that there's a reasonable expectation for her to look a certain way because that's the version everyone is familiar with.

It's like when they recast Morpheus in the new Matrix film. The entire time my brain is just thinking ""this isn't Morpheus"". You got Keanu next to not Lawrence Fishburne and it doesn't feel right. Another example is like Topher Grace as Eddie Brock in Spiderman 3. Eddie is a big dude in the comics and the iconic 90s cartoon series, but they got a skinny guy to play him instead and it just doesn't work. 

This isn't to say the actress can't do a good job of course. The director said she was the best pick and I truly believe that. She has a great voice and singing is kind of a big deal in Disney films. These are just examples of expectations not being met that lead to negative opinions of the work before release."

I agree with that. Instead of recycling we should get new stories. I’m a big fan of that. But it’s also not mutually exclusive. I think the bottom line comes down to what makes the character themselves. Being white is not what made any disney princess who they were. And so depicting them as a different race does nothing to damage their character. You hate remakes then by all means bash remakes. But the focus has not been on another shitty Disney remake. The focus has been on race and that’s frankly telling

Nope not really. They're trying to keep you from getting more recognition.
"Middle earth was based on European mythology. If you want an example from a fictional society, then imagine they remade black panther with a bunch of the wakandans being Asian for some reason. Then instead of incorporating a reason into the story, the film makers just call everyone who questions it a racist."
I hope Disney never cast a white actor again tbh just because its so funny to see people lose their minds over stuff like this
You have an NFT pfp :/
"Okay, first, please don't do that italics roleplay thing again.  I know it may look cool, but it just kinda hurts to read.  I learned that the hard way, myself.

And yes, I've zero doubt there are people being ""ape, ape, lmao"" about it, but acting like that's anywhere close to the majority of the negative feedback is just absurd.  There will always be idiots online, that's just how it be.  But taking those people and projecting them onto the whole disconcerted community isn't a good idea."
"The story *cannot* work if Ariel is anything less than a completely naive, *very* teenaged ingenue. An older character, or even a character more mature for sixteen than the original was would be impossible to root for. She'd be seen only as a selfish, reckless asshole because she's old enough OR mature enough to know better. (Again, loosely paraphrasing Howard Ashman.)

I have no doubt that in order to make the romance more palatable, this version of the mermaid is not intended to be a teen. And her singing voice will make it impossible to think of her as young and naive as she needs to be, in order to be likeable in spite of all the selfish risks she takes. 

The fact that their filmmakers don't think these things through answers all questions about why Disney Animation hasn't made a worthwhile movie in years. 

I've seen the other remakes you suggested. They're all hot flaming garbage from a writing perspective, and no amount of visual splendor can make up for that.

Edit: Also, I didn't say that Ashman's work is anything less than amazing. I said that Disney both doesn't understand why the decisions he made for the character mattered, and that trying to do anything other than what he insisted upon for the character (that was a *very* personal creation for him) is both disrespectful and very, very stupid."

"I mean, I get the frustration though. They should create new characters for black people rather then lazily race swap. Considering you wouldn’t race swap a traditional black character for a white actor."
Point to wakanda on a map
ESTABLISHED CHARACTER. Don’t be lazy and simply race swap the character. Write a NEW story about a NEW character and you can make them whatever you want.
"No, I’m saying it doesn’t matter, and shouldn’t be swapped “just because”. Make a new character and a new story."
It’s the definition of SPECIES. Ffs….it’s like pulling teeth…
"There’s that “fictional characters” argument again. All movie characters are fictional, but what they represent are real, which is exactly why we watch them. So the “not real” argument is tired and dumb. Black Panther isn’t real, but we see what that franchise has done for the Black Community. Even they know Wakanda isn’t real, but it just gives them….hope. 

So real or fake isn’t the point. Stop making that stupid ass argument."

"But race swapping for diversity's sake is something that annoys a LOT of people, not only white people.  I can guarantee you that if Miles Morales was redesigned to be white, for no discernable reason, a lot of black people would be pissed.  If Mulan was made white, a lot of Asian people would be pissed.  

People don't like when something is seemingly swapped around for diversity's sake in of itself.  Why is that?  Because it tramples upon the mental image someone had of that character, for no real reason.  That's why redesigns sometimes get thrashed, too, because the new ___ just ain't who the fanbase is used to.  

If Disney REALLY wanted to make a movie to appeal to diversity directed to black people, they'd make another black princess.  But they made another (hopefully not, but most likely) shitty live action adaptation, instead.

All that said, your connection to Jesus being inaccurately depicted still makes no sense to me.  This is a completely unrelated example, with different reasons for the change in skin color than him.  Also, this is MUCH more recent than Jesus's whitewashing.  It's still a stretch.

And it's pretty dense of you to blanket such a large group of people like that.  Shit's fucked up, mate."

"I would LOVE to believe she was simply the best actress for the job. I WANT to believe that. But we all know the direction Disney has gone in recent years, and they aren’t worried about the “best for the job”. Diversity is their goal, period. Leaning towards “diversity at all costs”. 

But either way, I’m tired of lazy story telling, hijacking or retelling old stories, and remaking old stories. Hollywood is getting lazy, and/or running out of ideas, and are trying to pass it off to the masses as “diversity”."
"I think your toxic because the only listeners you have are the 15 cats you keep in your house.  You sad, lonely behemoth."

Everyone can go watch the original if they don't want to see the new one. Why is this even an issue?"

"Assuming everyone has equal opportunities for roles? Sure. Only reason people care now is that poc have limited opportunities for roles, but if that wasn’t the case, why not? It’s not like the original movie ceases to exist. I actually thought of one: if they remade men in black without a black guy, I don’t think I’d care that much. A lot of Will Smith’s role aren’t related to his blackness. Throw out one of those as example next time you’re trying to bait, see if people give a shit"
"I know he was always black. The commenter specifically said people were upset that he was played by an ""*American actor*"", not ""*African-american* actor"". 

I just decided to look it up, and it looks like the character Eric Cross Brooks (Blade) was born in London, England. So they were probably referring to him being played by an actor born in the U.S, that didn't have a Brittish accent."
"To me, there are only 3 exceptions to this idea on race-swapping:
-voice acting
-fanwork (which includes parody)
-original intent (if a character was originally supposed to be of a certain race, but then was changed for some reason)."
"Um it did? The source material was from a white centric group that wrote about white characters, I mean Snow White is a perfect example of this. 

Her skin was snow WHITE, so now she’s Hispanic? That makes no sense."
"Atleast we agree on that.

Its true that being of a certain race is not what makes the character themselves, however, i argue that if the people don't even care about the design of the character to adapt him in live-action, is unlikely they will care about the more nuanced parts of the character.

I usually think of the death note adaptation of netflix for example. None of the characters look like the originals, so, you could argue that they just choose the best for the job and that the personality, which is what truly matters, is stellar? No, all the characters act in ways that the originals wouldnt. So, whats the conclusion here? That the characters act different because the characters were race-swapped? No, but that the writers didn't care about the story, which manifest in them not even caring about searching for accurate actors. It's not the reason a movie is bad, but it shows the interest that the writers have in the original story. Like, if you are referring to me that something like harrasment to the actors is bad, i agree (including the inverse like what Scarlett Johansonn suffered for ""ghost in the shell""), but using that as a justification for race-swapping, there i have to disagree."
"She is a white character, raceswapped. Again, you only see validity in originally white characters

Also, even if you think you are doing both, things like this show where your priorities are."
"I care because this shows a decadence in the way that diversity is promoted. Not with effort, but with color-swaps. The same question can go to you, why do you care on defending this?"

"Let's fix the start of your comment here:

> Howard Ashman's story cannot work...

That's great, but this isn't Howard Ashman's story.  It's inspired by his story, but it's not his story.  And in just a few months, we can watch *this* story and see if it works.

And again, if you're basing naivety on singing voices, then you need to see a therapist!  Seriously!  The actual human being that's acting in the role is 22.  She should be assumed to be naive until proven otherwise, regardless of her singing ability.  22 year olds are fucking idiots (some exceptions apply).  

Meanwhile, the last decade of Disney Animation feature films have won Academy Awards, critical praise, box office success, and include some of the most famous Disney characters and songs.  These include Encanto, Frozen, Moana, Zootopia, and a few others.  All successful.  

And frankly, if you think that The Little Mermaid (OG version) is great cinema, but also think that the 3 movies I mentioned are ""hot flaming garbage"" then you've blown any credibility that you had about movies (which wasn't much after the Disney Animation claim)."
"No, my argument is that mermaids don't even exist but you've become convinced that these imaginary made up creatures have equivalent genetic characteristics to humans. 

You're not wondering how they breathe, how they can speak underwater, why they even have vocal cords, why they have hair on their heads, how they reproduce...no, you think all that makes perfect sense. You're good with that. What you cannot accept is that these imaginary creatures, that literally do not exist, have different skin tones than you think they should have. 

Using Wakanda as a way to dodge the question is a really bad tactic as well. Wakanda is a fictional place that's set in Africa, and key to the plot is that it is populated by an isolated community of indigenous African people. Unlike mermaids, indigenous African people do exist, and unlike the skin tone of the Little Mermaid, the ethnicity of Wakandans is fundamental to the entire premise."
Ok kid. Enjoy your incel life.
That actor doesn’t even play Aladdin. He plays a spin-off character that’s…literally white. They didn’t race swap him for anything. Do you even have any knowledge of the shit you’re trying to spew or are you just pulling it out of your ass?
Why does her race matter enough to be preserved?
"Yes, a red tree frog and red lizard would be different species, but you seem to think they would be the same race because of their color."
"Jesus being widely depicted as white is used to point out a larger fact: these complainers don't give a fuck when it's the other way around. THAT'S why it's racist.

Ariel being black is inconsequential as all hell. Meanwhile the primary figure of Christianity was a brown dude whose portrait is exclusively pasty white in modern imagining. 

I mean, Jesus is constantly depicted in pop culture as white. It's not only recent. It's constant.

It's just an exercise in selective grievance on the part of all these people complaining. These internet mouth breathers will complain about a black Ariel and not think twice about a white Jesus.

You're actually doing it right now! You're actively dismissing the white Jesus race swap. Interesting."
"If you're going to argue from a perspective, your logic needs to be consistent.

Not being upset that Jesus is majorly depicted as white, but being upset that Ariel isn't white in this movie is a logical inconsistency."
You think someone giving you absolutely basic and easily google-able information is pretentious? Wow... you must feel insecure *a lot*!
"white isn’t the primary race of the u.s. though, we have people of all different sorts of race and culture here"
And that makes it right? You really sound like a white nationalist.
So casting an albino black person would be fine?
How is gender swapping a character comparable to casting someone with an olive skin tone? You’re just so fucking desperate
"The race of fictional characters, if it is not important to the story it’s telling, axiomatically means nothing in that individual story. 

Now could you argue that representation OVERALL matters? Sure! Swapping out every single minority character for a white actor, or only casting minorities as villains across huge swathes of media is problematic because it inaccurately represents society as a whole. It’s also sometimes done intentionally like how Hamilton swaps out the race of the founding fathers. But one movie coincidentally “swapping” the race of a fictional character whose story is completely unrelated to race? Yeah, that should be a non story."
"Well, here’s your fundamental misunderstanding. This is a new work, not a “copy” of the 1989 version. It’s a story, and the mermaids supposed “whiteness” plays no significant part in that story."
"Ok. This comment sells it. This dude is just trolling for kicks. Hahaha dude literally called black people having red hair ""cultural appropriation.""

Good game out there."
so irish people can’t be black…? you assume that black people cannot have red hair and that is weird and also kinda ignorant?
"That's not what cultural appropriation is, champ."
"Google search “black people with red hair” it’s a thing, they exist, you’re just ignorant and obstinate."
"Ariel is not an African American or white. She’s literally a creature of fantasy not based in reality or race. She’s half fish, half human, and originally had green skin in the initial fairytale; it’s nonsense to insist that her skin colour and hair need to reflect reality. 

If you’re so upset about the story not reflecting reality, then fantasy isn’t your genre. Either that or your racism is showing."
"As an irish person, let me be the one to tell you, shut the fuck up. The irish don't own red hair nor were we the only group of people to have red hair"
"Yes. It's me. Not the guy who said black people having red hair is cultural appropriation.

Makes sense."
I'm happy a dude like you thinks so.

They never came out and said “we’re going diversity all in!” Aladdin? Well Robin Williams was dead so , last I checked , smith did kill that performance. And the genie was blue so like, I dunno man. 


Fyi, you don’t seem to understand Disneys want to retell the same story. I agree with you on that but from a business perspective it renews their copyright on the characters ( albeit characters based on public domain characters originally lol ) 

I work in hollywood. The main stream is doing just what the music industry does and if you are a proud pirating person, it’s on you. 

Go back to the times of Elvis. Parents hated that music. He was , before his wild success, a huge fucking risk. 

However since music actually made money, they had enough of it to take gambles. 

Ever since streaming and pirating , hollywood, music, they go mainstream with tried and tested products. They have research teams at the costs of millions telling them what will work. Sure it doesn’t always translate but this is what we get for not contributing .

I know, do you think I’m standing up for the record companies for  Hollywood, but I’m not in reality. People like me who bust our ass we got affected first I could give a shit if Justin Bieber can afford to not afford another mansion, but I can tell you that the ripple effect affects everything from taking gambles, and putting out quality content. doing whats tried and tested works. It’s safe. Comic book movies etc. I had a friend who worked at CAA and had inside information, said that any Scripts coming their way had to have universe building, kind of like lord of the rings, or Game of Thrones, something that they could franchise and spinoff, and have tons of characters and multiple movies. 

You can’t get mad at Disney for doing what company is going to do and that is renew their intellectual property rights. By remaking the same things once in a blue moon.   You can simply vote with your wallet, and not go and not stream and not buy. 

 I but the fact is that simply casting this woman, more than likely was due to her, being the best person for the role. Let’s say Disney didn’t adopt a diversity at all costs, but simply adopted the ““ liberal mindset “of just being fair maybe that’s it, you can’t assume anything and the only proof you’re going off of his other people’s opinions of this.  Like bro she’s half woman half fish why do you need continuity lol"
"Bro, 90% of your posts are you whining about women in AITA. You could tattoo ""incel"" on your forehead and it would be less subtle."
"Yes, which is why I know what the next sentence says. I.E. The context. Do you?

Like you interpreted it as me saying people prevented Black Panther from being successful, and then some random comment about its importance to black people?

The context makes it clear that I was talking about who was responsible for Black Panther's success, and that it wasn't the sort of person who downvoted the Little Mermaid. Maybe you were looking for ways to argue and missed it."
That’s true.  But it’s only been three episodes.
"Yea, that's what doesn't really make sense in this ""people who use this extension are more likely to dislike videos"".

People who are more likely to dislike videos are the same ones who are likely to like them. Those who never dislike usually never like them either.

So those using the extension are possibly a good sample of the tiny percentage of people that use the like/dislike feature."
"Of course they can and i dont think too many people are telling them not to. The argument here is that a lazy remake where all that is changed is the color of peoples skin, or in some cases their sexual orientation, really adds very little to the film. 

To me remaking the film as a shot for shot remake but swapping in POC is a cheap pander that doesn't really increase diversity but looks more like token hiring. As other commenters have said, making a new story filled with better diversity would be a much better move. Like Frozen or Hamilton, fresh new stories."
"But why does it matter? In the fictional version, anything could have happened.  


Maybe its becaue it would be racist?"
"Then we agree, and The Little Mermaid is Danish folklore, the characters are all Danish, so by your logic the casting is all wrong."
Oh interesting. I hadn’t heard that and didn’t know blade was English
"Ok, that didn’t address anything in my previous comment but I’ll ask, why do you see those as exceptions?"
"Right that’s actually my point. The stories are from a white centric group and so have always been drawn white. But the race has absolutely nothing to do with their character. Ariel is in no way defined by her white skin. Snow White is defined by her skin color because that was the essence of beauty at the time. Whiteness had no impact on her character except to show how beautiful she was, the reason the queen was after her"
"Yea dude you are totally conflating two things. You are picking an example where the race AND the defining features or a character changed and then using that as evidence that if you don’t care enough to use the original race of the character, you will not do justice to their core features. I wholly reject that notion. Let’s take heimdall. The Thor movies did a pretty good job with his actual character, so the race was a complete and total non factor. If you butcher a character you butcher a character. My point is that the aesthetic features are  very rarely what actually make the character who they are. One of the few places this is a defining feature is with traditionally jon white character, because white is such the default that a non white character tends to use their race as a major feature of their identity, like black panther. Whereas if tony stark was black, absolutely nothing is lost from the character"
"So when all the bullshit, non-critical posts get pushed to the top, while people like yourself who has every right to be heard gets buried down below, you think that's fair?"
So it makes more sense to just shoe horn in random people in this setting? There are nations of dark skinned people in middle earth already. It would make a much better story to have a character from one of those places involved in the story rather than just making random elves black. They could even make a half elf character who's black because they had a human parent. That would open up a whole bunch of story options. Instead they did none of that. The poor writing goes far beyond the casting choices. There are all sorts of things in the series that contradict the actual books.
"A lot of it is also people playing themselves though, there are so many youtube channels nowadays that rile people up talking about woke this and woke that, inventing stories and narratives about why X company does X casting, because people love it and keep making them money, realistically there shouldn't be this much outrage to a fictional childrens characters casting, its wasn't born organically, its the algorithms"
"Ashman coached Benson to sing more like a little girl and fought for Part of Your World to stay in the film when executive types wanted to cut it. You're clearly unwilling to recognize how essential it is that Ariel be seen as a very sheltered, painfully naive girl (based in part on Audrey Hepburn's role in Roman Holiday). The entire plot hinges on the understanding that this is a foolish but charming child who we should all want to see saved from the consequences of her actions. An 18 or 22 year old would not have been extended the same grace, according to the original filmmakers (and maybe Walt Disney himself, he'd spent decades trying to adapt the Andersen story.) Ariel and Aurora were the only Disney princesses (until Rapunzel I think) whose ages were stated explicitly. It was important that Aurora be understood to be that young too, so that all the selfish and foolish decisions she made would not likewise render her unlikeable. If Ashman felt so strongly that Ariel's singing voice had to be very specifically girlish to get the audience fully on board with the character, that's good enough for me. 

Again, the story does not work without Ashman's Ariel. All the same familiar beats *can* still be there, there's nothing stopping them since they don't give a shit. But Ariel will be an asshole without the benefit of the grace we're all willing to extend to our own idiotic 16 year old selves. At 22 most people would recognize that she should know better, unless they're going to go full idiot Kimmy Schmidt on the character. The beleaguered Sebastian being sent after her won't make as much sense either, nor will his growing affection for her as he sees how much she's in over her head through comparatively little fault of her own. Calling her a hopeless child with so much affection doesn't make sense when it's an adult six years older who he'd be completely right to be furious with, for putting her kingdom's future in the hands of a power hungry sea witch in order to gratify her own selfish desires. Even allowing a sixteen year old to more or less get away with that sort of thing is a stretch. All the more reason to make her sound as childish as possible. 

I've never said that Mermaid is some sort of cinematic masterpiece. You think in such black and white terms. Disney's recent writing has been shitty. It used to be slightly less shitty, thanks to a bit more internal consistency and a tad more giving-a-fuck. 

Take a look at the mid to low rated reviews for those films you mentioned. They *all* feature criticism of the writing, the characters, and the soullessness of the stories as a whole.  Hell, even the higher rated reviews mention lazy writing. ""Success"" by that standard, or the others you mentioned is no guarantee of quality. They also concede that they're willing to overlook the glaring faults in the writing because overall, they're tolerable movies for parents to watch with their kids. What tired parents will tolerate is not a great yardstick for quality, but as studios care less and less, what else can parents hope for?"

"But...you have no evidence that any majority of these complainers support Jesus's ethnicity change.  No doubt some do, but you'll need some reliable connection that...connects to most or all of the people bashing it for it to be a ""gotcha!"" moment.

Jesus's skin color is irrelevant to the dude's lore, as well, to my knowledge.  It's not like the guy preached how hard it is to be of 50% melanin content.  By your logic, would him being whitewashed not matter, too?

"Oh i know. I’m just using the definition that Liberals have been pushing in recent years. The whole “taking our hair color/style is appropriation” thing. It nonsense, but you know us White folks just steal everything, right?"
It’s as rare as albinism.
"“As an Irish person”….like that has any clout. Science is science, numb nuts. Red hair is a generic abnormality caused by cold, northern climates. Anything outside of that is considered an anomaly such as rare skins diseases. 

“Although red hair is an almost exclusively northern and central European phenomenon, isolated cases have also been found in the Middle East, Central Asia (notably among the Tajiks), as well as in some of the Tarim mummies from Xinjiang, in north-western China. The Udmurts, an Uralic tribe living in the northern Volga basin of Russia, between Kazan and Perm, are the only non-Western Europeans to have a high incidence of red hair (over 10%). So what do all these people have in common? Surely the Udmurts and Tajiks aren't Celts, nor Germans. Yet, as we will see, all these people share a common ancestry that can be traced back to a single Y-chromosomal haplogroup: R1b.”

So, “as an Irish person”, you need to learn the history of your own heritage."

Remind yourself that overconfidence is a slow and insidious killer.
You’re literally on a burner account incel.
"Again, it’s not the fact she’s a human/fish. That just the most recent example. My issue is with the changing of things just so you can pat yourself on the back. You, meaning, companies like Disney. 

You’re right, it’s simply a company trying to make money, but it’s the high praise they try to give themselves for it. Like they are trying to do it simply to “better the world” when in reality, it’s all for the $$$$, and most people don’t see it."
You mean my literal one comment about a person acting exactly like you?
"And only one of the 3 was anything near boring, and it was only a little slow. The show has overall been excellent so far."
"At the end of the day it’s a skewed data set. You need a large number of all types of people using the plug in. Those who always vote, those who rarely vote and even people who never vote. I would assume it also takes views into account. You don’t do a political poll at a republican rally if accurate data is what you’re after."
"Part of the story of the Black Panther is that he's black, Ariel's story has nothing to do with her race."
"We don't agree. She's a mermaid.

Edit: I'm unaware of the full cast. I think that it is in some entertainment article somewhere."
"Yeah, that might have to do with that little caveat about the availability of roles for poc. But let’s be honest, anyone replacing Will Smith has big shoes to fill. As long as the pick has the charisma for the role I don’t think anyone would object"
"Yeah, it only was made so i could give more context to my other comment.

The voice of a person doesn't necessarily match his appearance, but when it comes to actors in live action, you need both appearance and voice.

Fanworks tend to be done by people interested in the source material, with a much lower budget and limitations than big companies like disney. There i can understand that someone was casted as a certain character, even if that person doesn't match the appearance of the original. With gigantic companies like disney? Not so much.

The third one is more of the idea that if you are going to make big changes in a story, they should be based on the source material. If the writer originally created a character a certain way, but then changed the design, i think that its better if you use the original design than, say, create one for the movie that looks nothing like the original work"
"You’re right it has no impact other to be low tier pandering. 

The reason so many are upset isn’t so much about racism, is the reasoning and laziness of it. 

I personally think race swapping is stupid, I’m a big proponent of sticking to canon, or writing something new. Just swapping a race is lazy and honestly should be offensive to people. 

When they made green lantern a black guy, they gave him a whole new story. So why isn’t Disney writing new stories around a black character instead of taking a 200 year old story and going “meh she’s black now”?"
"I don't deny the existence of exceptions to the rule, however they are that, exceptions. The thing that i'm trying to say is how much can you take from a character until it's not the same character anymore. I argue that if you are making an adaptation, you will try to make it as close as possible to the source material, only making changes based on pacing and the change from different mediums. If you, howevwr, change a part of the character because ""i don't really care that much about it"", am i really going to believe that that sentiment is going to only stop at that? If this was a fanwork, thats a different story, as those people work with limits that this big companies do not have."
"She is a character originally created as white.

Blade is a character, but he is mostly known as a black character, and as such, remains that way in adaptations.

This is pretty simple."
"This isnt a genuine honest conversation dude, like, i get it"
It's a fictional world with fictional races. They can portray them however they want dude.
"Absolutely, its the same as the news - negativity is your bread and butter - human minds are too simple for this shit really"
"Your entire comment until the last two paragraphs can be dismissed entirely by the single line: **This is not Ashman's movie.**  Full stop.  Until you understand that, then nothing you say matters.  It's literally meaningless, because you aren't critiquing this movie or this actress or her performance at all.  You are critiquing the 1989 movie, but substituting your own caricature of a different character that you've only seen 10 seconds of singing, and ignoring the fact that the 10 seconds is from a different movie.

And you didn't say that TLM was a cinematic masterpiece, but you're criticizing other similar quality movies and saying that they're garbage.  Meanwhile, if you look at reviews, it's not leaps and bounds better than the ones that you're saying are garbage.  You have a double standard and it's not me being black and white, but is you being blind to self-reflection on that.  And to be blunt, **anyone that dismisses every single remake as ""hot flaming garbage"", has no business saying that anyone else only sees things in black and white.**  

And as for the last paragraph, it's dismissed by looking at more than just the reviews that panned it.  ""If you look at only the reviews that said it was bad, then it's awful!""  Well, yeah.  The guy that hated Schindler's List probably thinks it's a shitty movie.  That doesn't make it a shitty movie.  (There is one bad review on Metacritic from the critics).

I'm done.  In this entire endeavor you still haven't learned that this movie isn't Ashman's movie.  Your other issues regarding film quality are just icing on the cake."
"I don't want to believe that you're too stupid to see the difference between a fictional story involving things that do exist (Black Panther) and a fictional story involving things that don't exist (Little Mermaid), so I'm going to be charitable and assume that you know that your position is ridiculous and you're just too pig-headed to concede the point."
the whole point is that it *doesn’t matter* so people can change it as they wish
"I think changing her race doesn't matter because her race doesn't matter. They can do whatever they want.

But her being white matters to you, so you clearly think her race matters. You wouldn't be upset by the difference if it made no difference to you.

Can you not answer? Why do you think her being white matters?"
"I've responded to all your points. Which one do you feel like I've missed?

And exactly how is Ariel's skin color related to her lore? You seem to be having trouble connecting your own threads..."
"You *have* to see the irony in your first sentence, yeah?"
so who cares if black people are protagonists in movies? you’re mad about it not being a white person because “ermagerd my 65%” but i’m sure over 65% of movies have white protagonists so why does it matter that one character is black to you?
And it was like 85% white when the Little Mermaid first came out.
Your example of Japan is irrelevant - which is 99% Japanese people. We are in the U.S. This is U.S. made movie. We have more than just white people in Hollywood. Not every character has to be a white person. The white population is 75% in the U.S. but white people occupy 94% of all TV and movie roles.
You just pointed out that skin color ≠ race. Thank you
Because the actress who won the role was black?
"Because Disney didn't set out to have a Black actress in the role, they set out to find the *best* actress.... who just so happened to end up being Black. And I don't know who you think you're fooling, your bigotry is both obvious and pathetic."
"Bro. You're not gonna get anybody with this one. They'll just Google ""black people with red hair"" and then the game is up.

I love the effort but this one doesn't sell well."
"you are mixing up race and nationality, irish people are usually white and nigerian people are usually black but it’s interchangeable. if i’m born in ireland and live there, i’m irish. if i’m born in nigeria and live there, i’m nigerian. doesn’t matter what skin color i am. not much of a difficult concept to understand but you’ll get there :)"
"The irish are not a race, we are a nationality. One that has many different races within our nationality"
"Rare yes, impossible? Absolutely not. Especially in a fantasy world with mermaids and sea witches"
But it still exists. So your point is irrelevant
How common are real mermaids?
I too am waiting for the penetration.
Remind yourself that cartoons are for children and you take them way too seriously.
"You have little black girls giving praise, while white patents are upset the movie from their childhood doesn’t look like their kids. Either way someone’s gunna complain. Who cares lol, it’s a she fish lol ."
You have pages of comments raging about women. It's fucking almost as funny as it is pathetic.
"I don't disagree, but the initial hypothesis is still wrong and the Republican Rally analogy doesn't really make much sense.

The fact is the majority of people don't tend to either like or dislike videos. The small majority that interacts with this feature probably tends to do \*both\* things often. Since the ""likes"" are still public, you do have an insight into how this small majority is interacting with the video, making it easier to predict the number of dislikes.

An analogy that'd make sense is if polling was only done among people who show some degree of political involvement outside presidential elections. For a country like mine, where voting is mandatory, the poll would probably be off. For a country like the US, where voting participation is low, it may as well reflect reality. Since liking/disliking a video isn't mandatory and is something only a tiny % of YouTube users actually do, their method might as well be working."
But it would be racist swapping a black character for a white one right?
"A danish mermaid.  


So that [female black danish jarl](https://boundingintocomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/2022.03.06-09.50-boundingintocomics-62252cadbccf4.jpg) in the vikings show was not to your liking then I assume?"
"I’m not sure what you’re saying in your fab works example. So if you don’t have enough resources to get an actor of the same race as the original character depiction that’s ok, but Disney should have been able to find a white girl to play Ariel?

You keep going back to “big changes to a character” and that’s exactly where you are getting stuck. Changing a characters race is rarely a “big change” it’s actually a completely and totally benign change in most cases, like Ariel"
"As I said before I’m not a big fan of the churning out of constant remakes. It just doesn’t make for good media to me. I agree it would be great to have more original stories with non white characters telling their own stories. But the outrage has not been about churning out another crappy remake, it’s about this notion of corrupting the original character by changing their race. And it’s very obvious because this specific backlash only tends to happen when a race is changed, not whenever a lazy remake is released. And another facet is that like it or not millions of kids grew up with these specific characters, white and non white kids. So there is definitely something meaningful in showing that these characters that everyone can identify with are not actually defined by their skin color but by their journey, their emotions and their personalities"
"Thank you.

Also, they didn't just ""made green lantern a black guy"", as it's not like they race-swapped Hal Jordan. They put the effort to make a whole new character, John Stewart, and give him the ring."
"But you’re making up the rule as if it’s a thing. There’s no rule of race swapping. It’s not a thing. And changing race in most cases takes NOTHING from the character except the most superficial characteristic. You pointed out how you didn’t like a series changing everything about characters you like, but the whole point is that having an actor of a different race portray a character changes absolutely nothing about what defines that character. Which is why I’m not understanding any reason for people being upset outside of discomfort seeing non white figures portray their nostalgic characters"
If Amazon had made that fictional world I would agree. If they wanted to ignore the story at every point they could have just made an original fantasy world. They just want to ride off the brand recognition of lord of the rings.
"Bet you can't come up with a plot featuring the most famous story beats from the original AND a more mature protagonist and have her come out likeable on the other side. Without, as I said, going full Kimmy Schmidt. 

It isn't possible. Especially not based on the original AND not when Walt Disney had tried to since the 40s, and others tried for decades on the version that came out in '89. Ashman's insight was the only thing that could have made it work. The Andersen story was far too dark and sad, being a story about a devastatingly painful loss of innocence that comes with a young person's introduction to the harshest realities of the world. Disney couldn't adapt it in any other way, not if they wanted to fit their brand and sell sparkly Mermaid barbies to the parents of little three year olds (me).

You're so insistent that the age and maturity level of the protagonist in the original don't matter (it's meaningless, your words) I'd like to know how you think the rest of the plot could be constructed. An adult disobeys her father (whose level of authority over her doesn't make sense), is interested in human stuff, meets a prince and rescues him. She has a fight with her father (shouldn't matter as much, as she's an adult, so Triton is unquestionably the asshole in that situation) and takes off spitefully to sign her voice over to a sea witch who she knows is not trustworthy. She makes the deal, as an adult, not having been coerced, to spite her father and get what she wants. She fucks over her father and the whole kingdom to get what she wants, and it's a short term benefit without any guarantee of it becoming permanent. Now she has to get the prince to fall in love with her. An adult woman throws herself at a prince, having given up her voice. With me so far? Still rooting for this character to get everything she wants? Mmkay.. Her father sends his trusted aide to keep his daughter out of trouble, but she's an adult.. so.. ? Daughter persists in her plans despite risks to the crab or anyone else. Sunk cost fallacy perhaps. It doesn't work, the witch wins a temporary victory, and the daughter is somehow not accountable, and still generally liked. Her father apologizes for being a dick. The end. 

At any point in the original, the question ""what is she thinking?!"" can be answered by ""she's a naive and overly sheltered kid."" That does not fly for a 22 year old, it doesn't matter how overbearing their parent has been. 

The opinion that Disney's remakes are hot flaming garbage (implying, apparently that some of their older films were not) is not an example of black and white thinking. You seem to fundamentally misunderstand the concept. Your statement that I'm comparing movies that are basically the same level of quality is based on your own opinion, not mine. The quality of all these movies is on a very wide range. I've never said otherwise. But yes, all of the live action remakes are garbage compared to most of the theatrically released Disney animated classics. It doesn't make them masterpieces, or make them all the same. It's ridiculous that your accusations have called for typing any of this out."
What part of Black Panther is real? Lol. Everything about Wakanda is fake. Lol
"But it DID matter so much, they felt the need to change it. That is my point. Again, create a new character and let her have her own story line and movie. That should be the route they went. But due to “wokeness” and laziness, they took an established character who is already in the world, and just flipped her. It’s lazy, racist, bullshit."
"Again, that’s not what matters. Ariel is an ESTABLISHED character that’s been around for 30+ years. THATS my problem. I would feel the exact same way of the character Shaft from the 70s was made white. Stop being lazy, come up with a new character and a new story. Don’t highjack an established character."
"Like my whole first reply to you.  I hope I don't need to rephrase my points here.  

And I don't believe I said that Ariel's skin is related to her lore.  I was connecting your idea that since her skin is NOT related to her story, it's fine that it's swapped around to your earlier talking point that Jesus' swapped skin color is bad.  Because his tone ain't relevant to his story.

Also, are you intentionally cherry picking what to reply to, or are these all you can come up with?"
That’s your “history lesson” is irreverent to the argument? No.
"Ah, see, you misunderstand. I encourage representation in all media. Variety is the spice of life. But make new characters and new stories. Don’t be lazy and race of gender swap characters just for the sake of representation."
"White people are actually 65% if the population, but that’s splitting hairs.

The point was, why is it racist for us to “white wash” movies, but not when the same thing is done in Japan, India and Africa?"
"No one was talking about skin color. YOU made that argument. Ariel’s race was changed. That’s the point of the argument.

Not sure why you think you won something here. Lol"
"No fucking way they did….


Like it or not she was chosen because black    

They wanted to mix it up and pander to the “woke” culture so to speak.."
I guess you missed the “almost exclusively” part. Neat…
"Let’s make this more simple for you…

What is the primary race in Ireland? 
What is the primary race in Nigeria?"
Ariel wasn’t albino.
Only if i can be the little spoon.
"Those little Black girls would have those same reactions to any story of a Black mermaid. As they should. So it is us adults that chose to destruct White Ariel to do it. 

Kids would have reacted the same if the story was about one of Ariel’s sisters. But they didn’t go that route, because…well…you know why. We all do. Which is why the movie is getting dislike and review bombed."
"Ahh yes raging, definitely.  You might as well have a neon sign over your head with Two X Chromosomes flashing.  Incel seems to be your favorite word to throw around thinking it immediately wins the argument you never actually engaged in.  Just insults."
"It's happened plenty of times in Hollywood. Let me know when we get to White Face, and I'll be on your side"
It would be a dumb move on Disney's part but I wouldn't say it's racist. It's weird you're so eager for white people who have been handed everything for hundreds of years to he consider the victim in something.
It just wouldn’t make sense to have a white black panther grappling with colonial survivor guilt. That’s pretty fucking obvious. Atticus Finch is a white character that HAS to be white for the story to make sense. Ariel is not. Get over it.
"I never watched vikings. It's supposed to be a historical drama, but it seems like dribble. In other words, you're correct. Vikings were from an awful lot of places, but not Africa. 


I don't have any idea why a Danish mermaid would look like a Danish human. So there's that."
"Changing a very obvious part of a character design is a little more than a small change.

Still, what i mean with fanworks its that if someone has a lot of limitations to actually adapt a story, then yes, you get a pass, kind of the same way that few people care about the cgi of a fanwork. You are aware they are working with a lot of limitations."
"Like I said, I’m a massive advocate for sticking to canon. If they tried to make ferengi green or white, or Andorrans anything other than blue, I’d have the same issue. (I wasn’t old enough for anything but Worf and movie Klingons to be my first imprint. So I was upset when they changed them in the Abrahamsverse, I was upset. 

Also, wasn’t there a ton of backlash for Scarlett Johansson playing a transgender role? Or Matt Damon for playing an Asian role? Or when they changed the deathnote actor to a white guy people were upset? 

Maybe we should just recast things to what was written and quit changing things to change things."
"I phrased it that way because up till that point there was only one human green lantern, so they “made him” black."
"Except, as i already said, if the writers didn't even cared about the most superficial things, is unlikely they will care about the most complex things. 

Apart from the other motive of fake diversity, of people seeing this as a way to show people of different races in the big screen instead of actually putting the effort to make stories with original leads of different races.

You say that you don't see a reason why a person would be against race-swapping characters outside of racism, i say that there's no reason to race-swap characters, and thinking that thats the way to generate diversity is racism, as, like i said, that is only seeing validity in originally white characters."
Look dude you can just stay mad about it if you want or you could just build yourself a bridge and get over it. They are elves. They aren't real. Who cares what skin color they are?
"Does Africa exist?

Do indigenous African people exist? 

Do mermaids exist?

If you can answer these questions truthfully and honestly then you might learn the real difference between Black Panther and the Little Mermaid. 

By the way, I know that you already understand the difference and you're just too dug in to admit it, so the above isn't really for you, it's for the benefit of whoever else might be reading this conversation."
i think it’s racist that you care so much about her being white. would you react so strongly if they made tiana from the princess and the frog white?
"Why does changing an established character matter?

Like why was it bad when they made a Black Superman? Why was it bad when Sam Jackson played Nick Fury? I don't understand why rewriting a character is bad, or why you have an issue with it."
So? Cinderella is also established and theyve had different races play her. Were you outraged back then as well?
"You replied to my post about Jesus calling it whataboutism. I told you why it's actually not whataboutism in the context of the current Ariel-is-black-now controversy.

You said people don't like when characters are race-swapped on principle. Because of mental images changing or some shit. I told you that doesn't hold true in the context of other race swaps. Most notably, nobody cared when Jim Caviezel played Jesus. Therefore, the arguments against Ariel being black are largely racist hypocrisy.

I should have included the concurrent bullshit outrage about LOTR Elves and GoT Incest Nobles but, alas, I missed that chance.

Then, after all that, you pretty much moved on from that because you don't personally care about Jesus being race swapped. That really proved my point, in a way.

You also assumed that I believe what you do, that the casting of Ariel was exclusively about diversity. I believe she was just the most qualified actress for the role. So, there's no use pursuing that thread.

And, finally yes: if a character whose ethnicity or nationality was important to their character had their race arbitrarily swapped, then people would be annoyed and rightfully so.

However, you just agreed that Ariel does NOT have a meaningful ethnic or national background.

So......."
"It’s not, though, it’s literally a counter to the premise of your entire argument. Surely you must understand that, yeah?"
but why are you mad she’s black? i can say that having live action disney movies is probably (def) a cash grab but why should it matter if a small trait from an animation in 1989 was changed?
\*sigh\* bye.
Believe whatever the hell you want redneck. It's freaking pathetic how a young girl playing a mermaid gets your panties in such a wad.
"And so how does 'cultural appropriation' play in here, Aristotle?"

Either way, change the situation and have hollywood alter african folklore characters to be white, and immense backlash would ensue, this is just a fact no matter what you or I say or feel, and if its racist one way, its racist the other way."
"Again, to me this comes down to you putting a lot of weight on a characters physical features, specifically skin color. I don’t see that as defining features of a character. And just about any adaption from a cartoon to a live action has some pretty notable physical changes"
"I’m not familiar with most of those, hadn’t heard about scarjo playing a trans character or Matt Damon playing an Asian character. I’m certainly no authority on what is right or wrong in terms of representation. But I cannot wrap my head around how changing a characters skin color, or gender or hair color or whatever, when that was never a defining feature of their character, somehow ruins that character"
"Yea that’s just an assumption you are making based on one Netflix show you saw? Or because it seems to make sense to you? You make it sound as if the writers didn’t know the characters original skin color. I assure you disney knew Ariel was white as originally depicted, this wasn’t them not caring to learn enough about the character.

I have you a reason. Millions of little girls who are not white grew up admiring Disney princesses, Ariel, belle, so on. Yes they absolutely deserve their own characters. They also deserve to see they are not excluded from every character of their childhood. There is a legitimate reason. Now what’s the legitimate reason that changing the race ruins the character? Because everything you are saying is either: 1. You don’t like remakes or 2. It’s forcing diversity- which I can only take to mean as you feel race is a defining feature of a character. Which I wholly disagree with"
"Of course Africa exists. So does the Atlantic Ocean, where Ariel lived. What’s your point?

Wakanda doesn’t exist. Neither does Atlantica. Again, what’s your point?"
"Ahah! Eureka! We’ve made progress and now we are thinking the same. 

Why do people care so much that she’s now Black?"
"Again, my base issue is, why do people care so much to change it?"
"Changing the race or gender of established characters is LAZY. Make a new character and a new story. Stop highjacking established characters. I would feel the same if they tried to cast the character Shaft from the 1970s, as a white dude. Shaft isn’t white, and he should never be. Doing so would be LAZY."
"Your justification how a ""what about x?"" statement isn't actually whataboutism never actually disproved my point that they're just not a good pairing to make. If you want to show that Ariel's race change is like something else, so being mad at one requires being mad at another, lest you'll be a hypocrite, then use something that has origins that aren't from about 2 thousand years ago.  Similarly, don't use something that had different purposes behind the change than the thing you're connecting it to.  Otherwise, well, it just won't make sense and be too much of a reach, especially for a whatabout point.

Jim Caviezel played a character who was already swapped a LONG time ago.  It'd be more of a shock to common belief of what Jesus looked like if he was played by a moderately darker skinned man.  That's not really a good example of swapped race characters being given the thumbs up nowadays. 
Hell, even if it is a valid example, that is but one example against my point.  I never said that every single time a character's race or design changes it is meant with backlash and that's it, I said that it largely is the case (meaning there are exceptions) and it can be fine with fair reason.

That said, what's the lowdown on GoT incest nobility shenanigans and LOtR elves having outrage?  I'm fuzzy about the elves, and I'm clueless about the GoT issue.

And when did i say (or imply) that I don't care about Jesus being swapped around?  From what i recall, I've explicitly said it was stupid multiple times.

My point about you being concerned about Jesus's ethnic swapping (even though it has no inherent impact on the plot, while not having concerns about Ariel recieving the same treatment was regarding your hypocrisy over one situation being a no-no, while the other is fine.  It didn't have much to do with your belief that she was cast 100% for sure for reasons beyond diversity.  
To simplify, my concern was over your differing beliefs about two characters having their ethnicity changed in of itself, rather than over why they were changed.

And with your last paragraph, you not only helped cement your hypocrisy over Jesus' change being a no-no, while Ariel's is fine, but you also showed that you completely fuckin ignored my point about WHY people don't like writers fucking with beloved character's ethnicities or designs.  If you want to make someone change their mind, actually read and understand what they've said, rather than blowing over it.  Or at least, don't oust yourself in doing so."
"Your comment doesn’t run counter to anything. THE LITTLE MERMAID (Specifically Ariel) is the version we are discussing. Not some older version developed in the 1800s. Nor does it have any impact on the conversation, as i said, is irrelevant."
"BECAUSE ARIEL IS WHITE. The established, 30 year old character is White. Why are we switching her to Black. You tell me why we felt the need to do that?"
"I think the most insulting thing I’ve been called so far is redneck (good job).   However the thing I’m mad about here is the blatant diversity pandering Disney is doing.


I’m sure that girl is a great actress make her a new Disney princess.


Its opposite racism If the part is just given because of race.."
"Because unless it’s a natural occurrence, dying your hair red, is appropriating the hair of White people. Thats the argument that’s been made about dreadlocks. Right?"
Because the argument was where Red Hair comes from. It’s found almost exclusively in Northern (Nordic) countries.
Lol this was never even about you and I arguing.  I was commenting on you and that dude Efficient_creme_3067.  Like I said I don’t even agree with him but your rebuttal to his argument was immediate insults so you lost
"That'll make up for Amos and Andy, what else you got?

Phobe, btw. Abomination of a movie."
Ah yes because every single movie that has ever race swapped has been bad. Everyone unanimously hates Samuel L Jackon as Nick Fury right?
"If the backlash is in charge, then why speak? Obviously change is not allowed or there will be backlash. Of course, there will also be backlash if one resists change. So perhaps you can wait and see which is bigger."
"Yet they still try to cast people, as close as possible to the original character.

Like, if they tried to cast Idris Elba as Dora the explorer, would you consider that good casting because he is a versatile actor?"
"It’s the reasoning of the change. What improvements are made by changing the character? 

Also o say all this while telling my kid it’s ok to use different paw patrol figures in his imaginary play (because the ones he’s looking for are gone) and that it’s the same pup in a different costume lol"
"But it was them not caring about the design of the character, and taking into consideration disney track record on remakes, this is just a result of how much they care about them.

That is true, wanna know about other character: Tiana, Moana. I can assure that there are a lot of black girls that feel identified with Mulan, and thats one thing, but then changing the race of Mulan to reflect that would be something different entirely. What i argue its that changing a characters race is a form of laziness. Laziness in how to get diversity, laziness in casting, and that laziness will be reflected in the material."
"people shouldn’t care but here you are. tell me, would you react as strongly if they made princess tiana white?"
"Because of historical and ongoing black disenfranchisement causing many of those childhood favorite characters to not be black.

Your attempt at flipping it around doesn’t work because of this fact. The two sides aren’t the same due to the society we live in."
"Logically they change it because they do not care about the race the character used to be, and see it as an opportunity for creative freedom to reinvent them. Same as Superman being black, or Nick Fury being black.

I'm just asking why you want to see her white, and why it upsets you to see her black. You keep giving vague answers or deflecting."
">	Changing the race or gender of established characters is LAZY

So you’re so pressed about… some movie producers being lazy?

Whats more lasy, copying as much as possible from the original in your remake, or remixing and changing some stuff? You’d have me believe the latter is more lazy?

>	Make a new character and a new story.

But, disney didn’t want to do that. Whats so upsetting about telling the story of my little mermaid with a black ariel?"
"Bro, it seems like you've gotten high between your last response to me and this one. I honestly have no idea what you're saying.

I legitimately want to understand what your point is and respond. I just honestly cannot follow the dramatic drop in the quality of your writing.

Please rewrite this tomorrow."
"Hahahaha and how the fuck, exactly, do you think The Little Mermaid got its story? Is it not, in fact, a fucking copy of the little mermaid from the early 1800’s? Are you that incapable of making a coherent argument?? This is hilarious!"
"She’s a fucking mermaid, dude. She can be blue or green skinned and it would still be appropriate. 

I’m sorry you feel so threatened by black people in leading roles. 

I’d like you to sit down with a 9 year old black girl and try to explain to her why she can’t have this."
"Cause god forbid anybody other than white people be actors, right? Jesus, you bigots fucking disgust me."
Aww honey bunny. These black people we are talking about are born with red hair...
"and she doesn’t live in a nordic country, she lives under the sea so why does it matter? her hair is red, she’s black, and that’s realistic but the whole shebang is that she lives in the ocean and it’s a fictional tale, so why does it matter to you?"
You're about as preceptive as one would expect a box of dong bags to be.
"Well Michael Jackson obviously, then there is The Watermelon Man from the 70s, Eddie Murphy in whiteface on SNL in the 80s and other movies after that, like Coming to America and The Nutty Professor, a show from 2006 called Black.White.  


Pretty much what I can come up with in a jiff, so its far from unheard of.  


So I take it you are with me then?"
"Oh not every movie, just every movie marketed via fan baiting lately."
"If there is backlash, people are reacting to something, in this case racism, point in case, race swapping, whatever way, is racist, the little mermaid is danish folklore, the reverse would not be tolerated, so this casting is racist.   


I just wish they would stop it with the fan-baiting bullshit and just make new stuff, make it as diverse as humanly possible, nobody cares, just make it good and stop exploiting racism to obfuscate sub par products."
"Do you really want to stick with that as your question? Cuz sorry dude that’s embarrassing and in my opinion that makes your case look really weak. Of course idris Elba should not be cast as Dora the explorer because he cannot possibly fit the base character description. Not because he isn’t Latino… but because now it’s an entirely different character. I cannot emphasize this enough, having a black actress play Ariel does NOT change who she is as a character and if you can’t wrap your head around that, it’s a problem"
"It sounds like you know the answer then. Because Ariel played by Halle Bailey is just as much Ariel is she is thinking, acting and behaving in line with the character. What is gained? In theory a ton of representation. People upset at the change of the characters skin color ignore that everyone else was excluded from these characters when they debuted. It sounds a very powerful message to say Ariel is Ariel regardless if she is played by a white or a black actress"
"Let’s just say for arguments sake they nail he character. Like a blind person would rave about the performance. Then would the changing of the actors race matter? 

Heimdall was my earlier example. And you said that’s an exception. The exception is that they translated the character well. The skin color was totally irrelevant"
"You’re right, people shouldn’t care. But here we are, with a Black Ariel. Seems I’m not the only one that cares."
"I agree. Which is the exact reason new POC characters need to be written and created. Not taking white characters and making them POC. That helps no one. It’s time we stop allowing Hollywood to be lazy and not taking the time to create new, and real POC characters."
“Reinvent” is a synonym for “steal” or “appropriate”.
"I reccomend reading it paragraph to paragraph.  As in, read your 1st paragraph, then mine.  Then read your 2nd paragraph, then mine.  That's generally how I respond to things, as it helps me direct what I'm talking about easier.

It's not perfectly 1:1, though, so be careful. 

I could have activated my braindead mode, but I just reread my comment, and it seems fine."
"Jesus, you’re insufferable. Anything to justify your own ego and neurosis."
"But she wasn’t green or blue, was she? If she had been, we wouldn’t be having this conversation, would we? The character was drawn to be a teenage, white girl. Much like Moana was drawn to be a young, Samoan female. Lilo was drawn to be a toddler Hawaiian. You starting to get it? 

So tired of this argument, but I’ll explain it to the 4077463rd person…

Those little girls would have that same reaction to ANY mermaid that looked like them and sounded as awesome as Halle. Ariel had 6 sisters, two of which were of Asian descent. So why not create a new character and story, and give those little girls THEIR OWN mermaid with a story, instead of hijacking a white mermaid? Too much to ask?"
Nope that’s not what I’m saying at all
"It’s a genetic anomaly in African people. Science is cool, you should learn some of it."
"Again, you’re confusing the argument that started this. That Black people can have natural red hair."
"Are you calling others incels while also going through their entire post history? Seems like something incels do, honey."
I'll meet you at Buffalo Wild Wings. Something's burning down tonight. Will your wife make the masks?
I think you still have to make up for Scarface tho.
So only movies you think prove your point
"Wait, so ""fan-baiting"" is apparently making something that, what, they think fans will like?   That they're sure fans will like? And the fans in this instance are wrong, but in backlash they're right? You're the one who pointed out that backlash is inconsistent, yet now you say it has more merit.

Your opinions are not making sense. They seem more like justifications for some other opinion, such as personally hating remakes."
And why do you believe that having a black actor completely changes Dora? Why does that makes him a completely different character?
"That’s the thing and the crux of my issue. They recast a role to pander instead of giving her her own role to make her own. 

It’s also “black washing” European heritage. Where’s the stories from Africa? Why aren’t we seeing those?"
"In that case, i would be surprised, and say that yes, that would be a case of an interesting performance, where the writers actuslly cared about the work. Still, i would prefer if they have made the character look like the original, but it would show to me that they, in that case, did valued more performance than appearance."
so why do you care?
">	Which is the exact reason new POC characters need to be written and created.

I agree. However, more than one thing happens at a time. Not every movie will be that.

>	That helps no one.

Idk if you saw it, but there was a quick compilation of a bunch of black girls reacting to the ariel trailer specifically mentioning how she “looks like me”. So it certainly does help."
"No, it actually isn't. Its a synonym for ""recycle"", ""refocus"", ""adapt"",  ""modify"", ""remodel"", and ""transform"".

Still no answer? Or perhaps you are *avoiding* answering because the answer looks bad for you?"
"I’m not 100% sure why you can’t just be an adult and disagree, but whatever you gotta tell yourself. You’re the one getting pissed over a mermaid."
Right. Hence the reason you douchebags start screaming bloody murder anytime someone who isn't white is cast in pretty much anything. Grow up loser.
"Aww, buddy. This just got sad.

You're really having a hard time keeping up with all this, aren't you?"
"and they can, so?"
"I dunno, she cut the holes all wrong last time."
Understandable.
Can you show me an example of a good movie using fan-baiting as a tactic to market their movie? Just one? 8/10+ only
"Fan-baiting is artificially creating outrage to get fans to go at eachother to generate attention and shield the product from criticism by going ""only toxic fans, ists and phobes don't like this"", which the gullible will  eat up and defend the product pro bono. This in turn makes review scores unreliable which is the intended effect when they know they have a subpar product.

No good movie or show is marketed this way, even if they do include the things used for fan-baiting, like female leads, race-swaps or LGBTQ representation, only the mediocre to bad will use this tactic, just take notice next time this inevitably happens, you'll see it clear as day."
Having a black actors does NOT change Dora. You didn’t read my response. Have a 6’3 50 year old man play Dora does completely change her character. You’re being disingenuous at this point
"Leave him, this people only see representation when it comes to race-swapped white characters. Not with originality"
"Then it sounds like your actual issue is with a character not being captured accurately and not about superficial characteristics being changed. Which I agree with. An accurate depiction of a character is capturing their motivations, how they would react in certain situations and their values. If these are met, I don’t see how changing the appearance makes any real difference"
Why do you care what race she is?
"I saw the video. But two things about that video that should be said…

Those children would act that way about ANY mermaid story with that actress. Even if she was playing one of Ariel’s 6 sisters. The representation isn’t the issue. Out of the hundreds (thousands) of mermaids of The Little Mermaid world they could have made this character, they chose Ariel. So those kids aren’t cheering Ariel, they are cheering Halle. 

How do you think they will feel if/when they get old enough and find out the character they loved and cherished so much, was originally a teenage white girl? They were so important to Disney, they didn’t bother to create a new, personal character, they simply repainted the old character and sold it like it was something new."
Wanna give me another irrelevant story about the history of pickles?
You clearly have made up your mind about me
"I’ll make it simple for you, and feel free to use google:

1% of the world population are red headed. What country of origin doesn’t the MAJORITY of red heads come from, and how did Red Hair even come to exist? What’s the scientific reason behind its existence? 

Take notes, there will be a test after."
He’s actually doing quite well. It’s you that’s looking pretty sad.
"But. Red Hair has an origin, and even has a scientific explanation of how it came to be….cold environments. How cold does Africa get?"
"Look at the context on the second comment, incel. But yea, fuck the bikers in my community."
"I’m not sure how this will “be used against me” lmao. Your opinion means nothing to me, incel. Not going to bother looking at your history, I guarantee it’s your alt account, incel."
"Interesting. I can see the idea. So, you're accusing Disney of this? Their biggest recent public dispute was over Turning Red, and that was a brilliant movie. Before that, Cinderella (lame) and Finding Dory (pretty good). But Turning Red really had people mad. So I don't agree with your idea. 

I've figured Disney has been virtue signalling for a while. That's a different tactic, though, with different purposes."
"Why? Why creating arbitrary boundaries when part of the argument was ""the actor doesn't matter, but the motivations and values of the character"". Just tell me the limit, and then we can talk from there. What is the limit that casting can get before a character is fundamentally different, if writing remains the same? As you said, perfect for someone blind."
Which is sad. They should be pissed and demanding new stories instead.
"However, i do, as appearance is also a part of the character. As i repeat, in that case i atleast see that both the actor and the writers tried their best. However, i would have still preferred if the character looked like the original. The same i say with heimdall. Would have preferred if the character looked like the original? Yes. Do i still believe that the writers and actor did the best that they could? Also yes."
"I go back to my previous comment.

If the decided to cast Idris Elba as Dora the explorer, would you consider that good casting, as he is a versatile actor?"
"i don’t, i think it’s stupid that people want to complain about her being black. why do you care?"
"Of course they could create any infinite number of new stories, and if the market is there for an extended little mermaid universe sure, go for it.

But the story is an iconic one that disney wanted to retell. Why is it an issue that, when remaking this movie, disney decided to cast a black ariel?"
"Pickles have nothing to do with the literal movie you’re talking about, at least not to my knowledge."
"Oh, by all means... dazzle me with your rationale for why a black mermaid is a crime against nature. I'll try not to laugh and point."
"This isn't 4chan. Stop posting silly rhetorical questions like you're QAnon.

So let's say a black person is born with red hair. You asserted that would be cultural appropriation.

How so?"
Lol get off your alt account.
everyone comes from africa shut up you massive chud. getting upset about a kids movie grow up
"I honestly don't care dude, you're entire schtick is exhausting."
"You're not very good at lying. You can't try the ""your opinion means nothing to me"" *after* it already triggered you.

So sad bro. You are not good at this at all."
"Not Disney specifically, any Hollywood production that they know is not very good, Disney has mostly done it with Star Wars and Marvel movies, but fan-baiting is hardly exclusive to them, and I can't say its been done all that much with kids movies, or at least not to the extent that have been used on other products. If its a good show or movie it will usually be organic outrage getting blown out of proportion and it will die out very quickly, manufactured outrage tends to stick around a bit more, and start before the release of the product, and you will see TONS of srticles on it.

But have a look at rings of power, its blatantly obvious with that show, Im just tired of it is all, diversity is great, but when used in this manner, only to shield mediocre products from criticism, its ironically very racist."
Honestly the more I think about your example the angrier I get. I now can’t see this any other way than you being a bigot. Here’s why. The little mermaid is the story of a teenage mermaid discovery herself and the world outside her home. Having a young black actress play Ariel does not change anything about that story. Dora the explorer is about a young child exploring her world and solving puzzles and challenges. Having a middle aged man play that character fundamentally changes the story. The fundamental nature of Dora cannot be captured by idris Elba. Their is absolutely no reason the fundamental nature of Ariel cannot be captured by Halle Bailey. But it seems to you that changing the race fundamentally changes the character. And sorry my dude but that makes you a bigot and your ridiculous comparison really drives that point home
"I mean I can’t take your opinion away from you, it just seems like at best your really tied to your nostalgia and easily lose sight of what makes the character the character"
I answered that for you dude
"If you don’t care about her race, why aren’t you on my side? If he race didn’t matter, there was ZERO need to change it.

The truth is, it ABSOLUTELY matters to both sides, what her race is. One side finds it so important that they felt the need to change it. The other side finds it so important, they want to persevere it. 

See how that works?"
"You just said it…it’s iconic. Which means, it has its own ESTABLISHED history, story and characters. Why tarnish that iconic history by changing everything about the character? 

Just so we are clear, i would be just as upset if they changed Sabastian from a Jamaican sounding voice, to a New Jersey accent. That’s not Sabastian. We all know it, and it would cause us to have a visceral reaction to his new voice. 

TV shows deal this very issue when an actor leaves the show. They have to try and find an actor that resembles the one that left, or the fans will reject the new character. Most times, they simply write that character out of the show. This is a normal thing."
"Neither did some 1800s Nordic story, but you seemed to think so."
"Sigh*   A crime against nature? Hardly hell I’m not even a Disney fan.

But again why the recast?  Light skinned girl blue eyes girl red hair, we’ve known her since 89.  Does an established white appearing character existing  mean that black people are being excluded?  Perhaps but Go to any Disney resort and walk up to the real person playing jasmine, what race is the she? She will most definitely be of middle eastern descent  Is that because of racism or because they are trying to be true to the movie?


Disney did this because they want diversity?  Is that wrong no I believe minorities should be included in IP as well but give them their own parts, looks like you’re just adding a token black person for the sake of looking like  a company that does that otherwise which is racist."
"That’s a nice fallacy you have there. But it’s clear you didn’t look up any of it. Red hair amongst Africans is an anomaly, equal to the likes of Vitiligo. It’s not the norm or standard. Pretend it’s anything otherwise, is ignorance bordering on stupidity."
A little paranoid are we?
"Yep, it’s not important. So why do YOU care so much that i care so much? 

Turns out, you care about her race, just as much as i do…."
Stop projecting incel. Mommy has your tendies ready.
"Why are you so mad, incel?"
"You're saying that Disney did it with Star Wars and Marvel. I remember one Marvel argument, didn't watch the movie so I can't remember the details. I just remember hearing it wasn't worth seeing. I definitely don't remember it lasting longer than Finding Dory's hubub! 

I think I'd be more impressed if the ones you're complaining about had been more than a blink of public complaint. I really don't understand where you're getting this idea that there's an inverse relationship between public outrage and movie quality. I suggest that there's little relationship. The complaints are merely a response to virtue signaling."
"You argued to me that the actor didn't mattered, if the actor was capable of showing the motivations and personality of the character. You even made a hypothetical were a blind man was interested in the movie because he couldn't see the character. If i made this example is to make you question the limit of this idea. Just tell me where your limit is in regards to casting, and based on that we can have a discussion. You can think that my argument comes from bigotry, while  i think that it comes from moral consistency (i think that white-washing is bad, so i cannot simply say ""but changing to other races is okay"")."
"Not exactly, the thing that im trying to argue is the contrary. That everything of a character is what makes him/her the character. You cannot simply take something away because it doesn't matter to you and then say ""still the same guy"". If you are trying to adapt, you should try to make it as close as the original as you can. It would be different if i said ""same appearance, but you can change the whole personality""."
"Yes, i put that before the comment you made. Sorry"
"i don’t find it important though, i’m just perplexed as to why you want to argue this out about why she should be white. her race never mattered so who cares if she’s black or white? she’s black in this movie and it’s clearly not going to change so i don’t get the outrage"
"Lmao dude you’re embarassing. The other guy is saying he’d be good with any of the following

1.	Live action ariel is white
2.	Live action ariel is black
3.	Live action ariel is whatever else

You on the other hand need ariel to be white.

All these people arguing with you aren’t saying ariel needs to be black, they’re saying she doesn’t **need** to be white."
But why bitch about it sooooo much. Just don’t watch it and move on with your life. It’s Disney’s ip and if they want to add some diversity to their famous line up good on them. It’s weird that it bothers you so much.
"Here you go again.

Having a black ariel doesn’t “tarnish” “iconic” history. Ariel being white isn’t even iconic, unlike Sebastian’s accent.

Unless you consciously noticed and mentally emphasized that the original little mermaid was white when you first watched it? Which would be kinda weird bro.

>	TV shows deal this very issue when an actor leaves the show.

Thats trying to continue the same production, not remake a movie thats *33* years old."
"It is literally the story by Hans Christian Andersen that the movie is based on. You get that, right?"
"Do you understand what cultural appropriation means?

It sort of feels like you're avoiding answering because you actually don't know.

Big oof. Hahah."
8========================D
This is tragic dude.
Is this about as deep as your well of creativity goes? There are puddles in the desert with more depth.
"Well if you didn't watch any of them or follow the hubbub around then, there is no wonder you didn't see any of the fan baiting happening, and that is kinda the point too, most people will not catch on to it, so they have been able to keep it up for at least half a decade."
"Ya know what you got me. If idris Elba can convincingly play Dora the explorer than I see no issue. But I do not see that as being possible, because there is a huge fundamental difference between a 7 year old girl and a 50 year old man. That’s the difference. And what you’re not quite saying but heavily implying is that you believe a nonwhite actress cannot convincingly play a traditionally white character. Which you should really think about"
It sounds like you identify the character with their physical appearance. I can’t take that from you but I find it tremendously superficial and shallow
I’m arguing that we SHOULD NOT SWAP ESTABLISHED CHARACTERS FOR WOKE REASONS. That’s not hard to understand.
"Companies like Disney make woke movies, and go out to the masses with the “look how awesome we are. We changed the race of a character. Aren’t we awesome. Please buy our stuff”. It’s gross, and absolute trash."
"That’s a neat argument, but complete BS. Everyone who doesn’t have an issue with this, WOULD have a issue if the roles were reversed. You can lie and say you wouldn’t, but you would….because even i would. But peoples fear of being labeled a racist, prevents them from admitting the truth."
"I use to have that same mentality when it came to racist music, movies and movements. Why get so angry when “Unite the Right” happens, why not stay at home and not deal with it? Right?

Because when you willingly give up your voice, you’ll never get it back. It’s our right as humans to say something if we see something that bothers us. Simply “ignoring it” is how cultures get slowly erased."
"Oh, I’m aware. But most people like yourself don’t know the difference between “appropriation” and “appreciation”. It’s the same nonsense like: 

https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/holidays/halloween-ideas/a40778/most-offensive-halloween-costumes/"
"Sure is buddy. Pretty sad. Still going through my posts? Some juicy ones in there, incel."
Sounds like something an incel heard in anime.
"Voice acting, for example, you dont know his vocal range. What i'm saying is that its always preferable to have an actor/actress that looks like the character if you are going to portray it. Maybe she can show it, im not going to deny it, she might be a fan, however, i still believe that, if you are going to adapt something, it should be like what you're adapting.

If i made my hypothetical, is because i expect some form of logical consistency with the arguments of someone, and i showed a case that was purpossedly extreme so you could see it. As you made me an example of a blind guy going to see an adaptation."
"More specifically, that i identify a character through motivations, personality, relationships and physical appearance. Again, you can consider any of the 4 parts of this as something ""not so relevant"", but its still a part of the character."
"it’s not a woke reason, she was never described as black or white in the children’s story. besides, it’s not an adaptation or sequel so the animation theoretically shouldn’t matter as it’s unrelated"
"Lmao dude unlike you, I’m not fearful of being labeled a racist. Because, I’m not. 

You’re not a daring truthteller, you’re ignorant and stubborn. 

As for your “rebuttal”, see my other comment I made to you. In short, “role reversals” are not a legitimate hypothetical because it presumes equality, thus ignoring historical and ongoing racism."
"Sorry, but you're not exactly a thick book to read."
"Nah you are twisting yourself in hoops over this. There is logical consistency in saying that skin color does not impact the character of Ariel whereas changing a 7 year old Dora the explorer to idris Elba fundamentally changes the character. This all comes back to you seeing a black Ariel as the same as idris Elba playing Dora. You want quite say it, but the point your making is the skin color, for you, is the essence of the character"
"Nah, 3/4 of those define the character. 1/4 is arbitrary and easily changed without compromising the character. And the more you talk the more clear it becomes that you feel the character is somehow inextricably tied to their appearance. Try and grow from this"
"Ready for a shocker that you won’t believe? I’m not racist either. But you, and people like you won’t believe it. Not yet. Once you get a bit older, you’ll realize that doing things like this doesn’t empower POC, it subverts them. In essence, instead of trying to create something for POC to be proud of, studios will placate POC by giving them characters already written and just “washed”. 

I’m from the camp that thinks every group deserves representation, but done so with their own heroes, not repurposed white heroes. It creates further division and gives a false sense of empowerment. 

Kind of hard to be proud of a character you idolize, when you find out they are just a character repackaged to look like you, but be nothing like you…"
Same can be said for you.
"Character design may not be the fullness of the character (the essence, as you may call it), but it's still a part of the character, thats what i argued. If i said ""maintain the design, but change the whole personality"", that would validate your point of view, but i didn't said that. But there is not logical consistency in saying ""the actor doesnt matter"" and ""this actor is incapable of portraying this character"" at the exact same time, as you said. To a certain degree, you agree with me that the actor does matter.

I argue for accurate casting, you argue for casting the best actor, regardless of appearance (with exceptions)."
"Look, it appears that i wont change your point of view in regards to this, and you won't change mine, so we can end this, unless you have something to add, from which we can continue. What i will say to, is this:

If you want a character to be of the same appearance as the original, that means that you want the story to be the closest to the source material as possible ""the rest being a given"". I respect that.

If you don't care about casting, that means that you don't consider it to be as important as the rest of the qualities of the character, and expect that the writers are capable of pulling them off. I respect that. 

But, if you believe that it's only okay to change the race of a character when they are from a certain race, regardless if its white,black, asian, native american, etc. You are racist, and i can't respect that."
"You can consider this arbitrary, but, as your other response shows, it appears that you have limits for this. I ask for character consistency, but your response that you showed to me makes me question how much you actually believe into what you say."
">	Once you get a bit older, you’ll realize that doing things like this doesn’t empower POC, it subverts them.

Because thats *totally* the argument you’ve made this whole time. You were *totally* not the conservative “characters should stay the same skin color” argument.

>	but done so with their own heroes, not repurposed white heroes.

Por que no los dos?

>	It creates further division

Where does the division come from? Because its absolutely from racists and reactionaries railing on the movie, not the other way around.

Or should disney pander to racists who don’t want black people in “their” movies to avoid offending them?

>	and gives a false sense of empowerment. 

>	but be nothing like you…

Bro, its a mermaid. Its not real. No one has a fish body, did that stop children from embracing the character? Did creating a movie about a fantasy species foster a “false sense of empowerment”?

No."
The shallowness of your complete lack of creativity is so thorough it's almost like depth.
"Again, you seem unable to see the difference between the essence of a character and their appearance. I seriously encourage you to think about this and hopefully grow a bit"
"No one likes having their stuff stolen. Like it or not, Disney makes idols of their cartoon characters. How would you feel if all your childhood idols were changed in every possible way, and become something you don’t recognize. You’re ruining peoples childhoods. That creates hostility. When it’s done simply for “virtue signaling”, that creates hate. Hate is what caused division. But nah, let’s just keep on the path we are currently on. Let’s see how far we can force that division."
You’ve said that twice now. How creative do you really think you are. I think Mommy is yelling now about your tendies.
"Yet, as i repeat, if you are making an adaptation, and show that you dont even care about the physical appearance of the character, then it's unlikely that you will care about the rest.

If you don't consider the physical appearance of the character, i cannot change that. But you need to understand that when people see in an adaptation of ironman that every single suit looks like a spiderman custome, people are going to complain, as it isn't the design they were expecting."
">	No one likes having their stuff stolen.

*Stolen?* *Their stuff*? White people don’t “own” ariel bro, and making a whole new movie isn’t “stealing” ariel.

>	childhood idols were changed in every possible way, and become something you don’t recognize.

The original animated movie still exists, and will probably be a better movie than the live action (looking at other disney live action remakes). People will still watch it, its not being “replaced”. Also, its one (1) thing, not “every possible way”.

>	You’re ruining peoples childhoods.

Ariel being black in the remake is “ruining peoples childhoods”? And you’re *not* racist? Sorry bro, I’m afraid your words betray you."
"Last time I said you were shallow. This time I said your shallowness is so thorough it gives the illusion of depth. It's a play on the same theme. I know this is confusing it's a bit above your pay grade, but it's for my amusement not yours so I don't care."
"You keep circling back to that and yet it’s your own invention. Again, absolutely no one didn’t care enough to realize Ariel has been portrayed as white. But that’s been a big leg of your argument that since they didn’t care to even make Ariel white surely they will not capture her wanderlust, naivety, or other actual defining characteristics"
"It’s interesting that you should complain about imagery, when when we can all admit, it is VERY important. It’s the very basis for a movies success or failure. That imagery you are trying to down play, is the very thing that made Black Panther so powerful and impactful. One could make an argument that imagery is THE most important trait of a movie or even music.

Interestingly, if i was indeed one of those “weirdos with a manifesto”, such talk would only push me further into my violent choice. Good job, it’s people like you that push people to that point. Well done.

But no, I’m not shooter. I don’t have time to do such things. Whining online doesn’t pay the bills for us “normies”. We just do it for fun."
"Sorry incel, I had SIDS as a kid and it’s been rough ever since."
"Look at the rest of live-action disney adaptations, do you actually trust them?"
"I don't think SIDS is something you can have ""had"", but I guess your mother eventually gave up trying."
Has nothing whatsoever to do with the point at hand. You wanna bash disney remakes go to town. But you know full well that has not been the point of this discussion. Also the jungle book remake was pretty dope
Right over your head. You tried though.
"Debatable.

What i say that this is just another way that disney laziness with remakes manifest, in the sense that they now don't even care about casting.

Again, im not denying her performance range, she might be great, however, as i said, this is still not an accurate portrait of the character."
Should it be a portrait? Her character didn't change after all.
"I argue that if the character looks a certain way in the original, it should look that way in adaptation"
Why though?
"Because it is an adaptation. You adapt.

I guess that your position on white-washing is the same as this one, i suppose."
"Isn't the point of an adaptation to change things as long as the plot and characters are very similar or am I missing something?
Why is Ariel's skin colour integral to the plot or her character? I don't understand why it's important?"
"The point of an adaptation is to translate a work to a different medium, only making changes in story for pacing or because of the fact that some things only work in an specific medium. Changing things just because you don't care is not how adaptation works.

Now, i repeat my question, you have the same idea on white-washing?"
"I don't understand why you're not just as critical about the different jewellery characters are wearing from the original movie then? Or are you?
If a characters ethnicity has nothing to do with the story why would it matter if that was changed? I certainly don't think that matters, so I'm curious as to why you think it does. Perhaps you think Ariel's ethnicity does matter in the story?"
"As i repeat, i argue that, if you are making an adaptation, you have to make it as close to the story as you can. Of course, a person can get the jewelry wrong, as few people will notice, however, getting an actor that looks nothing like the original is something that people will notice. This is deliberately getting things wrong from the original.

Now, third time, you have the same objections with white-washing?"
