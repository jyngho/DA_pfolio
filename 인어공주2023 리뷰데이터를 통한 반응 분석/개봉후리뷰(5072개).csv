Review Text
A definite must see Movie !!! Alot of different emotions which had a Happy Ending !!  :)
Less songs and more excitement. The new version was the best version of The Little Mermaid.
"It was soooo good,  visual effects were amazing,  story was great,  acting and singing was amazing!"
The movie was excellent
It was just like the animated movie
This movie was really good.  I'm glad there were slight changes but didn't stray too far from the Disney version.  I've already seen it twice
"It was a cute movie, but the script felt forced, like they were trying to hard to bring in aspects from the original animated film. Overall very cute movie, just was not very well put together, felt like it was patched up into a bunch of random scenes."
best live action remake by far
They could of done a better job at making Ariel look like Ariel. Her hair was not even close to being red which is a big part of her costume and just makes the character. Most of the storyline was on point.
"It was a delightful, beautiful movie. The music, the actors the visual effects were all amazing. I highly recommend it."
Loved that Disney kept all the original scenes and added some really good extras !
"Overall I can't say it says good as the original, however it respects it and is clearly made with love and affection for it. So I would say it's well worth your time!"
Blew our expectations out of the water! Ha ha!
The recliner seats were very comfy!
Im sorry but it was horrible.
"It was magical! 10/10...I loved everything about this movie...the casting, the singing, the whole thing took me right back to my childhood."
"I didnt care for Prince Erics solo song.  Other than that, the movie was fantastic."
Beautifully done!!!!
The movie was excellent! Both my teenage daughters absolutely loved it! Halle Bailey did a fantastic job with her role as Ariel. We plan to see it again before it leaves the theatre.
Amazing depiction of aquatic life!!!
It's a great reemagining of the beloved animated movie!! Give it a chance. I absolute loved it!!!!!!
Solid remake that properly honored the original.
Halle Bailey was brilliant! Must see this gorgeous talent!
The graphics was on point a well put together film.
Cinematography was Fabulous- 3D was Fabulous - music was Fabulous! Loved it!
The movie was visually stunning. Loved seeing the old animated movie come to life. Loved all of the actors. Lots of action and reminded be a bit of Pirates of the Caribbean. A fun summer movie
Movie was real good.   Very good story line
"Loved the movie 
True to storyline 
Awesome music"
TheLittleMermaid was EXCELLENT and so culturally diverse. Loved it! Definitely worth the 34 year wait.
"Loved this rendition of my favorite Disney Princess movie! Literal tears, Halle was phenomenal!"
"Ariel can sing.  The movie reminds me in cartoon.  Great job!  However,  I expected the girl with red hair, but there's no such girl with natural red hair like the cartoon."
Loved everything about it!
"This version was true to the original, I appreciated the new songs that were added, they were good and still in the style of the original soundtrack. The final scene was very intense and well done. CGI characters were not quite as lovable and comical as animated ones. We enjoyed the movie very much"
Loved it’s from beginning to end!
"Absolutely love, the story and animation have been close to my heart and to see it live send me into almost happy tears. A wonderful movie"
the 3d was a little blurry
The cast was amazing and Lin Manuel is a pure genius with song writing. And Halle is Ariel!
"Well done story, beautiful CGI and acting, incredible perfomance by Halle Bailey! The Crab needs his movie clearly."
Why didn’t they hire someone with the accent for Sebastian? Also Awkwafina isn’t that good for her to be booking all these roles. Her voice is just grating.
"Being a father who has had his child withheld from him, knowing with all your power yet feeling completely powerless, willing to give up anything just to make them feel safe. And the pain in knowing i will one day have to let my baby go It definitely got to me."
It was a little tear jerker at the end.
It was good but I wish it was more like the original version.
Great movie. I love the change to the ending.
Very culturally diverse great graphics beautifully made. It captured my ninth month old daughters attention a great deal.
"Halle Bailey's singing and acting was spectacular, loved the new songs written by Lin-Manuel Miranda. And, the Aator who played Prince Eric had the voice of a Angel. Loved the storyline and the costumes. The costume designer will definitely win several awards this year. I have already seen it 2 times (once in 3D). I plan on seeing it  again and again before it leaves the theaters. Love this Movie!!!"
One of the best movies everrrrre
cute movie with amazing visual effects
We were blown away! We absolutely enjoyed  all your services..thank you
Overall loved the movie but the Ursela interactions were a bit scary for young kids. The little girl next to us put her blanket over her head!
The Little Mermaid was Fabulous! The movie just drew you into the show and what was happening to the Mermaid! Great Movie!
Loved it!  It was perfectly made and depicted the original to a T!
My granddaughter and I loved the movie.
Best part was Javier Bardem!! Didnt need all the extra songs by Eric. Way too long!!
This movie is AMAZING!!! Brought me right back to my childhood!! Halle was INCREDIBLE and executed her role as Arielle PERFECTLY!!! Representation matters!!! Definitely a must see!!
"Not what I was expecting, killed my fav childhood cartoon."
I loved this movie. Definitely brought up memories of me being a child watching this movie with my parents. I  loved to see the diversity in all the characters presented in the movie. Amazing
Halle was born for this role. She absolutely killed it. The movie stuck true to the original story but provided a fresh and modern take. Melissa as Ursula was also more than I could’ve asked for! Job well done!
Great remake Halle first time on the big screen did not upset!!
"really liked the special effects and the new song by scuttle, Ursula death was a little scary for young children"
My daughters love the move. Me either I cry like a baby remembering when I was young watching the mermaid
"This new incarnation of  Disney favorite was beautifully made. The animations were colorful and vivid, although I could see why some could be put off by the realistic animal depictions. Flounder doesn't look as cute and childish here, but the spirit of the story is still there. Hailey Baley has an amazing voice and did justice to the lyrics and songs of the past. Prince Eric was perfectly cast, as he looked like someone just used AI to humanize the cartoon version. 
Melissa McCarthy rocked as Ursula.
Great experience at the theater and only adds a different and rich dimension to the classic cartoon version."
Loved the movie from being and especially the end. Well made Disney
"I loved the movie. The actors were great, the singing was magnificent"
"Thoroughly enjoyed it.  Kept my interest the whole time and the actors were fantastic, especially Halle Bailey and Melissa McCarthy."
The casting was absolutely incredible. A must see for the whole family!
"Wonderful story telling, great action, just a great movie for the whole family"
Great cast. I’m was AWESOME
I loved the entire movie start to finish! The acting was amazing the music was wonderful it was just an overall great movie
"It was sooo cute the CGI was crazy cool and the new songs Ariel sang were beautiful, I honestly prefer this new movie than the original."
Wonderful movie.  I thoroughly enjoyed!!
"Its a wonderful movie, makes me cry, at the end with her father scene,, very pretty and well performance and special effects."
Great beautifully done
"The movie was done well. Halle Bailey did phenomenal for her first acting gig and her voice is undeniable. The animation was pretty cool, it was an updated version of our classic Little Mermaid and they did the job. It was very nostalgic and also Melissa McCarthy is amazing as always. It did slightly have me at the edge of my seat when the action started to happen and my 5yr old little boy said he enjoyed the movie so plus plus from us!! CONGRATULATIONS HALLE!!!!!!"
The movie was giving me original lion king vibes with the color and animation. I lovedit a lot!!!
I loved everything about it! Melissa Mcarthy as Ursula stole the show
Cinematography was outstanding as were the musical  performances.
Great performances and fun to watch.
"We enjoyed it! Loved the comedic tone Ursula, Sebastian and Scuttle. Well done for a Disney live action."
I loved the diversity of the characters and how closely it matched the original movie.
"Richly colored, good storyline generally, nice entertainment for a few hours.  Movie was a bit long, though!"
Love Disney movies but the singing was subpar
I loved it it was funny special effects were awesome very beautiful colors all throughout the movie kept you watching the screen highly recommend watching it
"Enjoyed the movie very much! It entertained various ages, had wonderful music, and well casted roles."
took my grandmother to see it since she always put the original on for me as a kid and it was just a great time
"It was a beautiful movie, I was thoroughly engaged emotionally. I am glad new generations will grow up with this film."
Omg i loved everything about this movie it was fabulous.
Second time watching the little mermaid. This time was in 3D and i loved it even more than the first time! I thought i’d bought 4DX tickets but I guess not. I’ll have to watch it again in 4DX. Definitely a must see!
Excellent movie. I was moved by Halle Bailey's performance. She was the perfect choice. All of the cast did a wonderful job.
"Loved it. Wasn’t sure how it would compare to the original, but it was (date I say) better. Loved all the additions."
"The under the sea song was botched from the original. They didnt improve on it like they have in other live remakes and instead they took away the amazing full choir feel of it. Halle was great as little mermaid and I loved that some things were clarified in the live version like the sirens voice and how Ariels friends are helping her to get true loves kiss etc. But the climax was ruined for me when Ariel had to be the one to kill the sea witch instead of Eric in the original. To me this would have tied it all together to show Triton that not all humans are bad and that they worked together. Overal I felt the movie was meh and could have really blown some things out of the water but as usual per lately, they are missing the mark."
Loved it!!  Action packed and just a great movie.
My daughters and I enjoyed every minute of this movie
Excellent performance by Halley Bailey
The little mermaid captured all the emotions of the original and brought them to real life. Halle Bailey not only had the singer chops but the actress chops. She gave real life Disney princess and made the move spectacular.
The story was too drawn out and the characters were completely different from the original. Would not recommend at all. Its a movie you can watch at home when it releases.
"Very sweet telling of an old Disney movie. Loved Halle Bailey! It also had a Bridgerton feel - several supporting actors were familiar. All in all, great movie for the whole family."
this movie was very entertaining for children and adults worth every penny I spent on my family this weekend.
Great movie!! Must see! I think it was beautifully adapted to live action!
such an awesome movie!!
"they did put effort to make the movie, but my daughter lost interest in the first 15 mins. we laughed in some parts but over all, nothing special. So sorry for the actress but I prefer my original red hair beautiful Ariel"
"Disney did an excellent job remaking this movie. 
My whole family enjoyed it. Disney modernized it without going post pandemic crazy."
One of the best remakes Disney has done! Very entertaining and shed a tear at the end 🥲My daughter and I enjoyed it!
"Great movie, Disney did Great job. Beautiful ❤️❤️❤️"
Absolutely amazing. The show was so well done… I would definitely watch it again.
Amazing movie! The animation was outstanding
Well worth watching! Best remake of a Disney Movie!
"It was beautiful! The ocean colors, entire location sceneries was simply gorgeous! The singing, humor, and the positive storyline.  I loved all of it!!"
"SO WELL DONE! Halle was incredible, and she brought so much the role and movie even when her voice was gone. GREAT FILM!"
I thought it did justice to the original and the singing was awesome!
It was a great and was a politically free movie.
This is really a movie for kids to see they will really enjoy it very much my kids loved it and wants to go back to see it again.
"Loved the animation and the realness of the movie vs the old movie. Great songs, great actors. It is a must see for the entire family."
The movie was okay. It wasnt what I expected it to be.
Awesome movie! We loved it so much. Ariel was incredible and oh what an amazing voice. We just loved every single minute of it. It was so colorful and my little one enjoyed it
I loved everything Halle was amazing as well as the reat of the cast. It was exciting and fun to sing along with
It was great! It made me feel like a kid again and feel all of those nostalgic feelings. It was my daughters 1st movie and we watched it with Nana! They did a perfect job.
liked the diversity of the characters
I loved it so much it was so beautiful though the lighting was a bit too dark at times the movie was still amazing! I can’t wait to watch it again!!!!! Love Halle and Jonah’s performance and I’m hoping for a sequel!!! 💙
"It was good. Loved the music, & that Prince Eric had a song.  This version has Ariel calling King Triton ""father"" instead of ""daddy"" & they omitted the line ""But daddy, I love him!"", which is a bummer.  Also when daddy destroys her treasure trove, instead of clutching Prince Eric's face from the statue, she clutches his hand.  I thought they could have stayed truer to the wedding, as well. But I liked it, & my grand babies liked it!"
Much much better than the critics would have you believe. Everyone gave a fantastic performance. 5/5.
"Outstanding acting, and singing.
Special affects were amazing"
"The movie was great, interesting and funny. I loved it. This a great movie for the family."
Overall liked the movie a little boring and drawn out in the middle.
We loved it! One of the best family movies we have seen in a long time! The characters and theatrics were amazing!!
"This movie was an emotional ride, and I was enjoyed every minute of it."
It was awesome and it just made me remember how magical it was to see the original little mermaid
I loved the movie 😍
"Followed the original movie, and the animation was amazing! Loved it!"
I didnt like how the order of things was switched up. I didnt like how Eric didnt seem like a prince and they changed so many characters. I didnt like the changes of songs and the added rap song. I did however enjoy Ursula and thought Melissa McCarthy was amazing. There were a few added scenes that were funny that I enjoyed. Overall it was okay but definitely wasnt my favorite Disney remake.
Row E seat 17 doesn’t recline. The movie was amazing but we paid for a recliner seat and it doesn’t work
It was very cool to see the real people interacting with the computer generated characters.
The lessons throughout the movie and Halles raw talent.
"The Little Mermaid 3-d animation was beautiful.  The movement of sea life during Under the Sea was beautiful.  You could see the dedication and collaboration with the Alvin Ailey Dance Troupe. The signing was wonderful. Ursula was the ultimate villain. Kiss the Girl was true to the original. Great vision, great production."
Halle Bailey was superb and has a wonderful voice. Realign an animation mix was excellent. Brought a tear just like the original movie.
Awesome awesome. Halle we love you.
This movie was excellent! Quality animation and chole is a star! Everyone did a great job keeping it familiar but brought something new to it. Great watch
I loved it! Run to see it!
"Overall it was good, mostly stuck to the original movie. Felt more adult than kid movie. Took 4 year old and she liked it, but some of the witch scenes could be frightening to younger kids."
That was the worst Disney movie Ive ever seen.
"Very entertaining movie, visually stunning, great acting and great music. Not disappointed at all. Would definitely recommend."
Fabulous and heartwarming
"3D was awesome, great choice of actors and voices to play the characters in the story. Time well spent."
"Loved  The Entire Movie  
I just didnt like that they didnt have Many 
Little Mermaid Buckets  to Buy. 

They are Beautiful 
But Sold Out."
She was marvelous as good as it gets
Beautiful and wonderful movie
Sent out a great message on equality
Amazing movie! Brings back childhood memories.
"Too long, not good for younger kids"
"I liked Melisa McCarthy, Halle Bailey over acted. Too much singing."
5 stars doesn’t even begin to say how much I loved this movie.  It broke the star rating by a long shot!  A must see indeed!
It was beautifully made and extremely entertaining.
This adaption of the Animated version of  “The Little Mermaid was absolutely the best live action adaption Disney has done in a long while. Halle was simply awesome her voice is God’s gift to her and us. The whole cast  and cinematography was top notch. Kudos to Rob Marshall and Lin Manuel Miranda for their insight and daring to bring this film to families all over the World. Thank You !
"We loved the movie, it was a great remake.  The effects for 3D were fun and the new music was nice.  Scuttle the seagull stole the show!  Ariel was wonderful and so was Eric, a lovely match."
This is an Excellent live action remake of the original animated movie!
"If you’re a little mermaid fan you’ll enjoy it, Halle did a wonderful job as Ariel."
Made me cry and my daughter was so into it. Disney really nailed it here.
i like everything about it
I loved everything!!
"LoveTrue to the original little mermaid story. Great cast. The CGI may not haves been at its best, especially for Disney, but overall pleased."
"Absolutely loved Halle as Ariel, her voice was beautiful and she captured Ariels sweet and innocent personality. I loved the chemistry and bond they built between her and Eric that the animated version was lacking."
Great movie! Love this Disney princess! Loved her voice it was so beautiful
Me and my daughter loved it!!!
I liked how life-like it was.
"Movie was done well, really enjoyed it."
Fantastic! Ariel was kind and ambitious! Prince Eric was a dream! And Sebastian is amazing and hilarious! The only thing I disliked the name change of the sisters! Should of kept it all As haha
Great family movie!  Enjoyment for any age.
Really great adaptation of the original. Casting was fantastic!
Beautiful animation and the singing is unmatched
"The original was oh so special and this remake is even more magical! The music, the lighting affects, the fabulous acting, the humor and especially the live action sea creatures and birds made me want to sing myself. This is a beautiful production!!"
Not worth going to the movies for.
WE ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT!!!!!♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
As an adult I thought it was good. The scenes and special effects were quite amazing. Melissa McCathey was outstanding. Kids loved itespecially the girls.
Amazing!!!! So so well done! The way they incorporated different cultures was perfection. Must see!
"Beautiful movie, great cast!"
Halle Bailey was born to play Ariel. Thye whole cast was awesome. I got caught up emotionally in the story and it never let up.
Halles voice was otherworldly and I was pleasantly surprised by her acting. A nice variation on the original.
well done and the effects and colors were great...
very emotional and pretty spot on to the first original little mermaid
"Looking at this movie objectively, it was a good movie. as someone who thoroughly enjoyed the cartoon, this adaptation is good. it's not scene for scene and it has more songs added to it, but it's ok. The singing was great, and my daughter didn't fall asleep. (always a plus)"
Incredible.  The music was fantastic. The actors were well chosen.
Excellent movie for adults nd children!
This was a beautiful remake. Halle Bailey and Melissa McCarthy really made this movie. I thoroughly enjoyed it.
"Love love, great job. Nice to sing all the old songs with my daughter!"
"Wow, I will be back this Saturday to see it with my Son. Just awesome!"
Great movie! I cried 3 times. Brought me back to the very first time I saw the animation
"It was such a great movie! The acting, singing & side effects might watch again"
"I really liked how this went a bit more into detail with Eric and Ariel yet was funny and entertaining for my kids 4-15! Ursula was also terrifically  cast and performed, my kiddos were fine and liked her (they are easily scared too)- just a reminder shes there and not all kids are into villains but we all thought she was wickedly wonderful! Cant wait to buy it when it comes out!"
Very good and great special effects everyone loved it
"Very true to the original animated movie, minus a few new songs and new scenes. Beautiful animation and overall delightful movie."
My girlfriends and I loved this movie.  The digital art use for this film was amazing.  The underwater scenes were so well done and realistic.  I would love to see how they made this film. Melissa McCarthy was fantastic as the sea witch. Halle Bailey was a perfect Ariel and her voice was beautiful.  We plan on going back to see it in 3D next week. Congrats Disney on another amazing hit.
Very sweet and funny with a beautiful voice
"This was a great movie, I especially loved Halle Bailey as Ariel! Definitely a must see"
Loved how this stayed mostly the same as the original! Great movie!
I loved everything about the movie
"Started slow, but picked up and very true to story. The story line was exactly new and carried very well. Love it. Hope there is second part?"
Loved the cast and the fact it was live action. Very well done.
"A tremendously moving and heartfelt movie showing sentiment, romance, a little bit of danger and meaningful feelings and intermixed with fantasy elements.  Walt Disney would be incredibly proud on his 100th anniversary for this movie to become live action even though the cartoon version was very good.  The music, singing, songwriting and songs were so wonderful and Im glad that they were preserved from the original cartoon release version."
"I loved this, my 9 year old daughter looked at it with such admiration in her eyes to see a girl that looks like her in a main role in a fantasy movie."
"Good cast and singing talent, overall not as entertaining as expected, skip the 3D experience, not worth it. Original is best."
Loved it!  The storyline was pretty much like the classic animated movie.
Loved the acting and the songs
I love it !!! Nice movie
"I LOVED this movie, I feel it was better than the animated version of the little mermaid."
Really liked this live action version. It had some new things in it that the original didn’t and I enjoyed that.
Well-produced movie with excellent special effects. Good human and voice acting. Recommended for slightly older children because little ones may get impatient with the love story.
"This movie is a beautiful new take on the original, and the scenery, acting, cinematography and everything in between are all incredible! I cried, I laughed, and I was smiling the whole time. 10/10, would recommend!!"
The movie was perfect!
Great movie.  I cried and so did my sister.  The scene where her Dad let her go.......oh how touching!!
I loved the two leads and the music!
What a beautiful movie to see. I loved it!!
The visual was very dark and could have been brighter.
Familiar and true to the original Disney version but fresh and enjoyable. Amazing integration of live action and animation. It is definitely worth seeing.
too long. new attempts at the original songs didn't match up.
It was a fresh spin on a beloved classic. The theme and setting were perfect for the storyline. Loved it.
"Halle Bailey was truly spectacular as Ariel, loved it!!"
There was nothing to dislike the movie was phenomenal. We have an awesome time out this afternoon.
"I loved the new spin on the live action of the character and the movie, I can't wait until I can buy it and add to my collection"
"Slow needed different Ariel, Eric and Queen.  Seawitch stole the show.  Didn't need a rap song."
The visuals were amazing & the expounding on the storyline was great!
"Loved this movie, better than expected."
My daughter loved this movie! I recommend to all parents.
"Loved the movie, didn't feel like it was 2 plus hours long. Just beautiful."
Love the movie. Happy tears at the end.  Movie was a little too long for my 4 year old granddaughter.
"This movie was fantastic! The Little Mermaid was one of my favorite movies as a little girl, and they did it justice and then some! The visuals were amazing, Halle Bailey was EPIC, and Daveed Diggs was FANTASTIC! The original songs by Lin-Manuel Miranda refreshed the classic and made it relatable. I want to see it again!"
Great family movie. Loved Ariel !
"The changes made add to the overall story in a positive way, they managed to give both Ariel and Eric more character depth, and everyone in the film nailed their roles."
The movie was pretty good. My only issue was the casting. Eric looked twice Ariel's age lol
As good as the original classic
"Prepare to be swept away on a breathtaking journey beneath the waves as Disney's latest cinematic gem, The Little Mermaid, captivates audiences with its timeless charm and visually stunning cinematography. This enchanting adaptation of the beloved classic tale breathes new life into the depths of our imagination, reminding us of the magic that lies within us all.

One cannot help but marvel at the impeccable cinematography that transports viewers to an underwater wonderland. From the vivid coral reefs to the ethereal mermaid kingdom, every scene is crafted with such meticulous attention to detail that it feels like a living, breathing work of art. The vibrant colors, the fluid movements of the characters, and the awe-inspiring visual effects make it an absolute delight for the eyes. Director Rob Marshall's vision is brought to life with such finesse that it is impossible not to be completely immersed in this fantastical world.
But beyond its stunning visuals, The Little Mermaid delivers a powerful message that resonates deeply in today's society. It dares to challenge the prejudices that persist in our world, reminding us of the importance of acceptance, inclusivity, and celebrating our differences. The casting of Halle Bailey, a phenomenally talented young African-American actress, in the role of Ariel is a bold and progressive move by Disney. Bailey's portrayal of the iconic mermaid is filled with grace, strength, and undeniable talent, shattering stereotypes and proving that diversity can only enrich the storytelling experience.
It is disheartening to see some individuals succumb to prejudice and racism, expressing their displeasure at a beautifully diverse cast. However, it is important to acknowledge that this new rendition of The Little Mermaid is a reflection of the world we live in, celebrating the diversity that exists in our society. Rather than dwelling on such negativity, let us applaud the film for its willingness to break barriers, inspire young minds, and foster a sense of unity among its viewers.
The music in The Little Mermaid is another standout aspect that deserves praise. The timeless melodies that have become synonymous with the original animated film are reimagined and beautifully reinvigorated. The talented cast, led by Bailey, delivers powerful vocal performances that breathe new life into these beloved songs. It is an auditory treat that will have you singing along and humming the tunes long after you leave the theater.
Ultimately, The Little Mermaid is a cinematic triumph that seamlessly weaves together stunning visuals, a diverse and talented cast, and a poignant message of acceptance. It reminds us that our differences should be celebrated, not feared. This film has the power to ignite conversations, inspire change, and leave a lasting impact on audiences of all ages.
Let us embrace the magic and wonder of The Little Mermaid, and let its powerful message serve as a reminder that love knows no boundaries and that our world is at its best when we stand united, celebrating our diversity."
"A heart-warming, family-friendly musical that celebrates diversity, forgiveness, and understanding. Some scary moments are not for small children."
It was excellent! Very realistic. There were a couple of changes from the cation version. But it really lived up the the hype. Chloe’s singing was the highlight. That lady has some pipes on her.
"FANTASTIC MOVIE! I really did not know what to expect, but this is by far the best Disney remake. Perfect casting!!! Go and watch, you will not be disappointed."
I love it so much. Halle did her thing.
Halle and the entire cast did an amazing job with this film. I really enjoyed TLM!
The casting. The scenery. The music. All amazing!!! A must see 💜🩵🧜‍♀️
I loved the spin on this classic movie. The characters were amazing!
Pretty good Movie not a must see for me. But I babies enjoyed it!!! I’d watch it again
"The movie is beautiful from start to finish. The quality of the acting, the cinematography, the songs ... everything was perfection!"
Absolutely loved it!! Beautiful scenes.
We really enjoyed this remake! Loved how they didn't deviate from the original script. I think they did a great job! Thumbs up for my family and I!
Good movie that was same as animation but had different scenes at time.
"I loved the story, the music, all of the characters. It was beautiful!"
Ariel was so pretty and sounded beautiful! We loved the movie!
"Great movie, the original details"
"The movie was awesome,  beautiful graphics"
"The animation and colors were amazing.  I took my 4 yr old granddaughter.  She got scared,..we left a bit early."
"The animation, music and story were all amazing."
"Keeps a lot from the original animated film, but also expands on some things and changes it up just enough to keep it exciting and from being an exact copy of the original film. Very fun movie, great music, and beautiful visuals. Great for fans who grew up with the Little Mermaid and young kids just being exposed to Ariel."
Sooo awesome really great seeing the diversity
My wife and I loved it! A fun movie for all ages!
my nices love the movies
Little details that made movie special and different from original. Great singing by Ariel. Good humor
it was pretty much a scene for scene remake of the cartoon movie.
So adorable  brought back so many wonderful memories watching it as a kid! Loved the add on original songs as well! Loved it!
AMAZING MOVIE! MUST SEE
"i absolutely adored the movies, the characters, the songs, the way they played the part was all amazing!"
"Really good! Great visuals and Halle was amazing. Loved how you could see so much emotion in her facial expressions, she really brought you in. Now I want to live under the sea lol."
Excellent movie.  Our family loved it.
Halle did an amazing job!! And Melissa McCarthy was amazing as well!
"My wife claims it’s better than the original, but as someone who was raised in the 90s I would say there equally matched."
It was a really great movie. The music and the looks were really well done.
"I absolutely loved it and the bar was high for me since I saw the animated version in theaters when I was five. Halle was incredible as Ariel, and Eric, Scuttle, and Flounder were all standouts I did not see coming.  Again, I am just completely blown away by Halle. She was perfection."
Best remake Ive ever seen!  I absolutely loved it!!!
it was incredible! halle was spectacular and nobody and i mean NOBODY couldve EVER played the little mermaid better. she brought her to life. i LOVED this movie
"I dont like that Ariels hair was not red lol 
Thankfully it didnt ruin my fav childhood movie because it follows a different flow. 10/10"
"Too too long, lacked the magic that you'd expect. Visuals are cool, and Haile is beautiful and lovely voice. Kids in theater  were BORED!"
Wonderful experience
"Beautiful flowing and colorful story that draws you in ! The characters are so real to us! The caring but overprotective father, curious adventurous lovely Ariel and her best friends Sabastian the crab and the bird who keep us laughing!!  This new version will keep every age person entertained and is by far the best!"
The movie was made for todays audience and reflected what our society truly looks like. The music and cast was great!
"I've waited years to see this. I wasn't disappointed. Loved it !! Great Acting, Awesome Script, Amazing Directing"
"A very well made adaptation of the original. If you've liked the other live action Disney remakes, you'll love this one just as much. Halle did a fantastic job as Ariel"
"This movie is stunning visually and the cast is brilliant. I watched it with my 6-year-old the first time and it did not go well due to the movie length. However, went and saw it a second time just by myself and it was incredible! Cannot wait to watch again."
"Haileys performance was absolutely incredible.  I cant speak enough about how she connected to the audience with her beauty, inquisitiveness and talent.  I also LOVED the fact that the movies was very inclusive and diversified.  Representation of what the world really looks like."
Liked the beautiful colors  in the sea and the story line
"The movie was excellent , I really enjoyed myself"
AMAZING AMAZING AMAZING!  I couldn't help but tear up at part of your world. Halle handled this with such grace and beauty simply stunning. her voice is indescribable. the cultural blending of characters spot on.. how we should live in this world
Awesome storyline and graphics
Was Soooo good and sooo Disney Well Done
I loved what they did with this! I grew up with the original (one of my favorites) and I was worried. Both me an dmy 9 year old ending up LOVIING it!
"I was impressed by the adaptation of this film to 3D which reminded me of the Avatar release I saw last year. The cast was diverse, it featured a couple of new songs, and we were thoroughly entertained throughout the movie. A little boy even ran up to the screen to pet the dog because he thought it was in the same theater! My 9-year old was scared at the end during the Ursula fight scene but because it was SO realistic. Overall this movie was spectacular!"
Heartwarming love between father and daughter. Love at first sight was sweet. We loved it
"Musical lots of singing. Very long but needed to be. Don’t know why they mentioned Erik’s questionable family ties but didn’t expand on it, makes more sense to take that out. Overall very good"
"Very cute remake. Close to the original with a few surprises scattered about and some new musical numbers. My kids enjoyed it and sat through the whole movie. The characters were given refreshing and modern updates from what we saw in the 90s while keeping close to the classic movie we all loved. I do wish the main character, Ariel, made more of an effort to communicate despite being unable to speak (as she did in the original cartoon movie). It would have made the story more believable. Still, bravo to Lin Manuel Miranda for bringing this fairytale back to new life. Well done."
loved this classic film reimagined
The movie was beautiful Halles voice literally shook my soul
Very cute movie. I really enjoy it. Everyone had amazing vocals and it kept me entertained. I would suggest watching this movie with an open mind and to not compare it to the original. Overall highly recommend to watch. Its a definitely a feel good movie.
"Loved the entire movie, cast was awesome!"
This movie brought my innocence back. It was a beautiful recreation and I am glad that I had the opportunity to see it.
It really brought the story to life! I liked the new songs. Aqua fina was hilarious!  Thoroughly loved it!
"Halle ate DOWN okay rent was DUE!!! This was my second time seeing it, I absolutely loved it."
It’s a 10. Would recommend it!
"Such a joyful movie, transported me right to my childhood, Halle Bailey is my new Ariel 🥳☺️"
Amazing movie great adaptation
"I absolutely loved the entire movie, but the movie cut off during the screen time and they had to start it over."
Loved it!!! Loved every single actor choice. I don’t have any complaints. This was my favorite movie as a child in 1989 and it’s still a good one today!!!
I mean absolutely breath taking! I'm in complete bliss! Halle just set the bar for african american girls all over the world! NEVER STOP DREAMING!
It was hard to see parts of the film in the underwater scenes.  It was a blur even wearing the 3D glasses. My granddaughter enjoyed it though.
I love that they made this a cultural diverse movie❤️
Didn't really watch it as a kid like it was my favorite movie but I remember key parts and it seems like it on point. The movie gets 5 stars.
This movie was SO beautifully done! We loved it so much and cant wait to see it again. It had all of the original moments and the added bonuses were perfect!
Loved everything props to Melissa McCarthy for Ursula role and Halle they did this movie justice
Great movie. Missed a good part when I had to take my niece to the restroom. Will watch again.
It was Beautiful and had wonderful messages.Daughter and I saw the movie twice. Halle voice is amazing I had goosebumps.
It’s not perfect. But what actually is? Make you believe in love.
"it was pretty great, one of the better reimagined disney movies, but some of the scenes were a bit choppy but you can totally ignore it for the chemistry of the characters and their personalities that they bring. pretty great id even see it again"
"I liked the beautiful colors, sea life and the singing and dancing scenes. Over all the adaptation was ok.
I disliked the over use of CGI and that there were not many familiar actors/actresses."
"Beautiful acted and uplifted. Charming until the last scene which was phenomenal,  different than the OG animated scene and brought  me to tears. Instant elevation from four stars to five stars. Excellent film"
Well done! The acting and singing were really good and was glad it was live-action. I enjoyed the new Scuttlebutt song a lot.
I loved it!!!!  Im so glad I didnt listen to negative Nancys and miss out on seeing this wonderful movie with my family!
Great cast and funny.
It was what I hoped for while still adding unique twists on the classic.
It was very well done and seeing it with real live actors makes it much better that the cartoon version.
It was visually stimulating!
"Absolutely loved this movie. What Disney and Halle Bailey did was magical, simply amazing. So much fun. Music was wonderful."
"Absolutely fabulous! I had tears in my eyes the whole time. I felt 6years old again, just as in love with the story as I was as a little girl walking around singing all the songs. The movie was wonderfully done and the casting was spectacular! I loved everything about it. The movie was wholesome and relatable now. I felt even more connected watching this version. Go see it with your children its so worth it."
Loved the cinematography as well as the singing!  Halle did an amazing job as Ariel!!!
Amazing move!!! I absolutely loved the music. Acting was superb. Definitely worth another watch!
I was ten years old when the original Little mermaid come out. I remember watching it on the big screen with my mom & siblings. Im thrilled to relive the experience again with my children.
It was a great way to see ourselves as brown people being represented. This allows our children to see themselves in these characters and know that we all have a place in this world.
"Very good movie, loved the added songs. Took me back to my childhood."
"One of the most exciting well put together cast I ever experienced, Halle Bailey was beyond beautiful as Ariel, such a.amazing acting skill as a mermaid and her voices was extremely beautiful  Will be seeing it for a second time,"
Absolutely loved it!
Loved the 3-D feature.
Absolutely amazing. This young lady not only has an outstanding set of pipes but she is also a great actress. The story followed the same plot as the animated original and any deviations only enhanced it further. I was not disappointed.
"The movie was just fantastic, very engaging! I thought I was just going to nap while my three daughters watched, but it was so very well done, I watched the whole thing. I'm still singing ""under the sea""...."
I loved it  great movie
The special effects were wonderful. The acting was awesome. It was really good. Better than the first
The whole movie was awesome
Very good movie  family movie
Completely loved it ‼️
The movie was boring!
"The movie actually followed through ad the cartoon which was great. The French chef didnt make his appearance, that was one of my favorite scenes from the cartoon."
I really loved it .. Halley did an awesome job
This is my second time seeing it and planning to see it again soon
"Amazing depiction based off the fairytale cartoon. Great music and solid acting. People will gripe based off their own prejudices, but it was a great live-action movie that kids and adults will enjoy."
"Loved the action, music and storyline.  Loved the characters and the special effects.  Would have liked the Prince Erik to have been the one to take out Ursula, like in the animated version."
"Horrible. Music was thin, flat, poorly arranged, lacking up-best tempo and minimal harmonies. Couldnt stay past Ursula."
Everyone in the theater with me were clapping and cheering at the end of the movie. I am so glad that they did not leave out any of the classical parts of the original little mermaid. They did the story/movie justice. Well done!! Excellent!
Beautiful remake of the original. It took me back to my childhood.
fandango advertised this as an 4DX move and it was not! the move was good but I was very disappointed
"Beautiful cinematography, great singing. I could not complain. I think it was an awesome remake of the Little Mermaid."
"Scuttle made the movie! Great music, even the new songs!"
"Music
Sebastian 
Story line, dad missing daughter"
I loved it! It has great content
Very appropriate for 3rd grade girls.  My daughter very rarely can sit through a 2 hr movie.  She was entertained the entire time.  I made it through as well and found it very entertaining.
I loved The Little Mermaid!  It was a great movie with a relatable storyline.   It was funny and definitely a tear jerker.  I will definitely watch it again.
"Wow! What a wonderful movie. Superbly acted, outstanding music. All around high five!"
"Incredible, incredible, incredible! The music was amazing, the acting was amazing! The caring was the best part! Disney did it again! GO SEE IT!"
I like that it was funny and sentimental. Really feel good movie.
Great visuals and new songs. The movie was wonderfully casted and Halle Bailey was magnificent!
"The movie wasn't as good as the original, but it was pretty darn close! Really did enjoy watching it!"
I liked and enjoyed everything.
Amazing and full of color!
I love Halle. I love TLM... 100% best live-action I've seen for Disney (princess wise)! Halle Bailey has an aura unlike any other. The other characters played their roles well. Vanessa's actress was amazing for the minutes she played embodied Ursula to a 'T'. I hope there will be a part 2 although that would be hard to make  if you've seen TLM series!
"Great movie , the kids and husband loved it."
AMAZING! Loved Halle Bailey and Melissa McCarthy’s performance. This might be the best live action remake of a Disney classic I’ve seen yet!
All the underwater scenes were amazing and the singing was lovely!
"Absolutely incredible, the music, the cast, the animation, everything was just perfection, and everything and more!!!"
Love this version of the Little Mermaid. Halle did an amazing job with acting and her voice is so powerful. Loved every moment of it.
"The worst Disney movie ever, people were walking out not even half way, my girls were soooo upset. Total fiasco. We felt robbed"
"It was very entertaining.  I enjoyed Melissa McCarthy as Ursula, and king Triton was pretty cool."
"""Les Poisson"" did not make it into the movie. Neither did Ursula bemoaning the fate of her ""little poopsies."""
It was so great! Better then the OG
I like where King Triton says its for your own good and then destroys Ariels Eric statue and also where Eric snatches Ursulas crown with his bare hand and also where Ariel makes a ship pierces Ursula and she dies and where Scuttle sings the Scuttle Butt and then Sebastian is like lets go and then Ariel covers them and then Sebastian says Scuttle youre to close.
Halle Bailey’s voice is gorgeous! Overall I liked this new version. Not crazy about Ursula’s make up. Animations were really nice and Under the Sea and Kiss The Girl continue to be iconic!
The music was awesome
The best movie ever 🤩🤩🤩
"I absolutely loved everything about The Little Mermaid!  Halle Bailey brought Ariel to life in a way that was totally fascinating! Halle, that young lady gave an outstanding believable performance! The voice of Sebastian had me hook line and sinker and OMG Melissa McCarthy played a scary Ursula so well she was truly believable.  Bottom line am going to go see it again and in my opinion every single character was beautifully portrayed!"
Great actors and beautiful scenes!
It was visually pleasing and enjoyable.  I took my young Granddaughter.
"Music, animation, storylineall fantastic!   So well done."
Liked the songs. Flounder did not look like flounder
Excellent!! Will see again!
It was good but they added unnecessary songs.
"I usually worry the live actions will dim the nostalgia I feel when watching movies I grew up with, the casting in this movie was immaculate and Halle Bailey is beyond amazing as a vocalist, and her acting, age and soft/gentleness is perfect for Disney movies. I’m not too familiar with her music aside from this project but I was moved and emotional by her vocal performances. I think it’s beautiful at how well executed and diverse this project was. It was modern and refreshing but not overly ambitious to change what was already a great movie. Job well done Disney."
I liked that they had mermaids of all races shown in the movie. I thought party under the sea with all the sea creatures was cute.
Absolutely amazing! Going to see it again!
"The live version of The Little Mermaid was AWESOME. Halle Bailey has a phenomenal voice and Melissa McCarthy was a great choice for Ursula. Eric’s actor was… Eric. Yeah. 

Anyone that can pull off the song, Part of Your World, with that much emotion is PERFECT for that part. ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ 

HOWEVER, I don’t like the movie Jaws, so if you don’t like it either, I highly recommend skipping that scene. 🤣"
I loved it! It was perfect!
"I never saw the original little mermaid, but I thought this version was very good.."
Fantastic work by Bailey! A solid remake
It was adorable for 3 generations of family. From 10-75 years of age!
It was great.  I thought it was a little violent for kids though.  But it was awesome for grownups.
Took my granddaughter to the movie She loved it!  I liked it a lot too!
"Love the movie, it was funny, enchanting and heartwarming!!!"
We loved! Loved! Loved it!
Great movie. Better than expected
"Visually stunning, great performances from Hailey Bailey and Melissa McCarthy et al."
Still prefer the original. But at least Disney put a good effort into this one. Some very hilarious new parts. True to the story.
Best Disney adaptation yet. True to the original. Loved every minute.
Absolutely amazing!! Relived my childhood watching the little mermaid!!
It was so crazy and turn of events and was funny the songs were amazing and overall I’d give it a 10/10.
Halle Bailey was incredible. Mellisa McCarthy is an unbelievably talented actress and performer.
The music was great and the CGI was amazing! I liked the new parts that were added.
Its Disney! They work hard to do a quality product most of the time!
"The special effects were fantastic but the acting was just so, so."
whimsical and magical - every little girl has dreamed of being a mermaid. This movies lets us.
"I liked the music, the characters, the special effects and the story."
Me: what didn’t you like about it? Wife:IDK that’s the review folks
Excellent movie! Theater was perfect!
my daughter and i enjoy the movie a lot super cute
First movie to utilize 3D properly!
"It was sooo good. I laughed, i sang along, I cried, and I would watch it again. So good!"
Absolutely loved the movie.
"It was amazing, so realistic!"
Amazing and all the singing was on point I love Lil mermaid and the cultural aspect of it everyone is the same and equal
It was well acted & Ursula was very fun & funny. Ariel & Eric did a great job. It was an almost exact copy of the animated one from my youth with was nice & familiar but it also would have been nice to see some artistic license taken. The volume level was intense and my 9 year old had her fingers in her ears most of the time & at one point wanted to leave because of it.
We loved it my daughter was so excited when I told her were seeing the new little mermaid definitely 10 out of 10 highly recommend
Very cute movie. Akwafina was hilarious. Loved the music and singing!
I loved the music. The story my 4 year old could follow along with without getting bored. I as an adult did not get bored either.
"It was boring asf , I hated this fucking movie sorry"
"I am typically disappointed in the live action Disney movies, but was pleasantly surprised by this one."
Absolutely wonderful!!
The hold movie was great
Gorgeous! Halle was a perfect Ariel. The girls and I loved it!
I adore seeing mermaid that looks like me and also awesome representation of my children as well. The movie was beautifully made!!
Halle has a beautiful voice!!!
"Thank you so much for everyone on the team that created this movie for all of us. The Little Mermaid is a classic, and I’m sure most were worried that a live action would ruin the original. It was very close to the original and it was so beautiful. The added songs were very nice as well! Thank you from a young, inner child. 🖤"
"Amazing! My second time, but this time I saw in 3D. Still loved the movie but 4D was better."
Amazing film!!! Great music!!! The nostalgia will get you!
Little scary for the 4 year old the 8 year old loved it
Loved the visuals and the singing
Great movie and I would definitely see again!
Excellent movie. Loved the music and Halle was exquisite. Her acting was outstanding. A wonderful movie experience.
Amazing Movie….. if you disliked it or the Halley version of Ariel you’re just a hater…. Period…..
I didnt like that the show made my 3 and 5 yr grandsons scared. Its too advance for little ones. Just felt like the witch was yo evil looking and just over the top. I honestly wouldnt even give 1 star.
I enjoyed the movie! It is one of my favorite Disney movies. I loved the theme and how cultural relevant it is!
"LOVED the 3D effects, the singing, the humor, it was great!"
The whole movie was awesome.
Better than the original!
Beautiful movie. My son loved it!
Like the alteration of the story
"Loved it stuck to the original film. Though some parts were slow, the music was spot on and I was impressed with Triton and Ursula being siblings. The ending, even if it didn’t make an impact as the original, was pretty good. Good work and dedication from the crew and cast."
Soo drawn out and long. The cartoon version was 100x better.
I loved the whole movie
I love the mermaid character. Her singing it was so loved.
Beautiful animation and great songs.
The changes are a HUGE surprise and it’s visually amazing!!! This movie impacts us between old and new generation. Halle Bailey did an amazing job on her role as Ariel and she NAILED it! 10s across the broad!
"Loved it!!! Often the remakes of such classic movies are a let down, but not with The Little Mermaid. It stayed true to the original but realistic cast members, and a few new songs. I really enjoyed it and even got a little emotional at the end. A must see for all classic Disney princess fans for a fresh new take on a beautiful story."
This live action remake of classic from my childhood was well done.
"Loved the scenery, acting with a make believe of mermaids living with humans  nicely done!!"
"I grew up watching the original Little Mermaid and have to say that this remake was much better! They embraced the original songs and storyline, while adding a new spin. Ariel and the entire cast were great. I’d definitely see this again!"
Absolutely amazing. Halle is superb!!! Melissa McCarthy is delicious!!!
Absolutely loved it. Great movie.
solid 10/10 lots of singing and the cast line was great in this movie!!!!
The music!! The acting was really good also.
"Not your original version, but definitely a great remake! Halle Bailey did a fantastic job!"
I loved it!!! I was more excited than my pre teen daughter
"If you love the Little Mermaid story, youll enjoy reliving the live action on the big screen. I think Halle Bailey did an amazing job as Ariel, as did Melissa McCarthy as Ursula."
We loved it. Our family had a great time.
Such a great remake of a Disney classic.
Beautiful colors. Great ending. Well done. Amazing actors
More lifelike of course. The producer stuck to the theme o pop f the original other than the end.
I loved the singing and all the beautiful colors. It told the original story and also added other things. I just loved it.
A gorgeous remake of a classic. Amazing scenery and fabulous music.
"I had to let go of everything I already know in order to enjoy the movie, overall it was very well done."
Loved the original songs and the few new songs. Was great for my kid to see and for me to remember how much I loved the original little mermaid.
Loved how beautiful and talented all the actors are in the movie especially Halle she did an amazing job
Surpassed my expectations. Melissa McCarthy was absolutely amazing.  Halle Bailey was very convincing as Ariel.
Seriously unlike any movie I've ever seen. Must see in 3D to get to full effects. It was different enough to be a totally different movie from the original but also honored the beloved classic.
"Loved it , it could have done without rapping from scuttle but loved it!!!!!"
Beautifully filmed.  My 8- and 4- year olds LOVED it.  And Halle Bailey is so beautiful and graceful that I could watch her read a phone book.
Loved the whole movie. Excellent job
CG is great.  Beautiful colors and movie was entertaining.
Beautiful movie all the acting and singing was perfect!!!
Loved it!!! The movie was very good!
I just saw it second time first with my boyfriend and then with my mom!
Awesome job done by the actors and actresses.  Halle Bailey was a wonderful Ariel ❤️
Fantastic! Excellent actors and animation was great!
best Disney remake to date
Music was great. Movie was cute and funny! I remember the little mermaid original as a kid but I think they did a good job remaking it.
Halle Bailey is the most perfect Ariel. She was beautiful and she sang beautifully throughout the entire movie. The Princes singing part was a little corny but overall the movie was good.
Great remake. Halle did this right.
"Love it, and the message of not taking your childs voice for granted. Solid cast and good visuals."
Very cute movie for all ages!!
"Beautiful story, music was great!"
"there were so many things they added that were needed, eric had a song that wasnt good, under the sea song just wasnt the same, where was the chef and Sebastin scene, Aquafina could have been funnier, some scenes could have been a little more dramatic but I will say Melissa Mccarthy stole the movie she was an amazing ursala!!!!"
Went to see it twice!
Awesome movie! I loved every bit of it!
Great singing. Melissa McCarthy as Ursula was great! Special effects were very good. Parts of it might be a bit scary for young children. Probably better for ages 10 and up! Loved it!
It was a great remake of a classic Disney movie with a little twist.
How it was very similar to the old classic I grew up watching but at the same time had a twist and nice spin.
Great movie. Halle was so perfect for this role! All of the actors and actresses were phenomenal!
The movie was great! My daughter and I loved it. The theatre experience was horrible. Concessions a nightmare. Guys vaping in their seats. Its no wonder people stay home now.
"It was good but still loved the original more!   Not sure a remake, live version was needed."
It was very diverse I loved that with the remake
i really enjoyed it. The color of the world under the sea was amazing.
"Halle Bailey was easily the standout in this film! Nobody else could of played her role. There were some moments I even cried a little bit! The whole cast was amazing, and definitely had some funny moments, especially from Scuttle, played by Awkwafina. Overall, the film was a delightful experience. My friend and I saw it in 3D which made it even more enjoyable to watch! 5/5 stars!"
"Gret colors, graphics and music"
Sebastian should have been cast by a Caribbean person.
"Better than some Disney Live Actions but not the best. If you dislike them, this wouldn’t change your mind, but the movie was fun and wouldn’t mind watching it again if asked."
Really stuck to the original!
The visuals was amazing!
My daughter loved it and so did I.
"Disney always with the wokeisim and remaking a classic.
Remake it but leave it dont change it, including the characters."
Enjoyed this live action remake!!! Was a little long and my 4 year was bored at times but I absolutely loved it!!
great acting but same movie !! which made this boring as heck !!
Halle Berry & Melissa McCarthy are worth it. Lin Manuel Mirandas songs are totally out of place though. Just weird mismatched style. Using the new songs from the Broadway production would have made more sense.
"Disney's live action Little Mermaid was really good, I highly recommend seeing it!!"
Id like a better ending.
"My girls and I loved ""The Little Mermaid"" starring Halle Bailey! She was a phenomenal mermaid! The remake was a lot of fun to watch and sing along to! We'll be watching on repeat in the future!"
"The movie was very beautiful, colorful, and just All and all the the best I was in awe with the colorful scenes and the music"
It is a cute family film.
"Original is better, CGI looked cheap, story was changed, should have not been made."
"I’m an avid fan of the original but this blew me away & I’m very picky. They all did amazing, I love they made it modern & fave Prince Eric a background. Halle was just perfect & the instant she sang I got goosebumps"
OMG I loved the movie. I can’t wait to buy it so I can see it again.
The Little Mermaid was my favorite childhood movie.  I didn’t expect to love the remake as much as I did.  Halle Bailey was the perfect Ariel.  Amazing graphics and fun characters.  Disney nailed this remake in my opinion
This was one of the worst 3D effect movies I have ever seen. Do not spend the extra $$ on 3D.  And wait for it on Netflix or other.  😔the. Singing. And casting was good!!
I had one person that wasn’t able to come and I couldn’t get a refund at the movies .   The movie was amazing
"This movie was a breath of fresh air for the likes of both children and adults. The visuals, acting, and of course the iconic songs made my day! Such a joy to see, this is a feel good movie. Glad to see that mostly everyone enjoyed it as much as I did."
A new version of a classic treasure. All the magic brought back and expanded upon. I’ve seen it twice now.
"I enjoyed it thoroughly,but my granddaughter didn't. She got scared of Ursula!"
"Really enjoyed this version of Little Mermaid. Halle Bailey has a beautiful voice. I liked the new songs and I liked the overall take on each of the characters-Ariel, Ursula, Eric, Sebastian, Flounder, Scuttle, etc. They all did a great job!"
beautiful movie!!!!!
Fantastic!! Such a great movie and Ariel was amazing!!
Great storyline and plot!
Me and my daughter loved seeing this in 3D. The scenes were beautiful and vibrant but also different and unique in their own way.
"It was wonderful. The singing hit me to my core. Loved Halle, Javier, and Melissa. They truly brought one of my favorites to life."
Loved it absolutely beautiful 10/10
Halle Bailey did a great job!
Cinematography brilliant. Acting superb. Fun. Fresh! Awesome movie
Perfectly done. The costumes and set is amazing.
I absolutely loved The Little Mermaid.  Best movie I seen in a very long time. The whole cast was amazing.  Halle Bailey is indeed Ariel.
"so beautiful, very energetic and colorful 10/10"
Great visuals!! Awesome music updates!  An absolutely beautiful film.  I love the representation and actors choice.  Well done Disney!
I loved watching it in 3D and it being with humans
I was hoping to see the chef and Sebastian part and when Ariel sat at the dinner table using the fork as a comb and pipe as an instrument. Also I didn’t like the fact Prince Eric wasn’t the one to kill Ursula.
Too long !! It dragged
"Love everything about this movie. All the colors beautiful song reminds me of the cartoon version, some parts of the movie was new as parts of the first little mermaid didn't made it in the movie...even it has its own version it didn't take away too much of the old version loved Hailey Bailey she did very well that girl can sing thumbs up to her and the cast all did a great job."
Excellent 🫶🏼🔥🔥my Baby girl loved it 😍😘😜
"The movie was just so gorgeous, they thought of everything. Vanessa looked absolutely stunning and as so did Ariel. 🧜🏽‍♀️"
"It was ok.  I prefer the original.  :) this version lacked that spark that the live action beauty and beast or Aladdin had. 
Ariel did a good job. Prince Eric could not act to save his life IMO.  He was my least fav.  And his solo song was just forced. the CGI was a bit special/choppy especially towards the end.  Scuttle is a girl which was interesting. Prince Eric and Ariel have 6 pack abs which is unnecessary."
The movie was very good but we were so distracted from the heat it was hard to enjoy. The A/C went out before the movie started and did not come back on till the last 15 minutes.
IT WAS AMAZING. VERY NOSTALGIA FOR ME
AMAZING!! AMAZING!!!
I really enjoy the movie❤️ I can’t wait to watch it again
Great additional songs done right for the movie.
Ironically enough I never watched the original but I really enjoyed this one.
It was Ah-mazinnggggggg. My babies loved it
amazing beautiful unsurpassed by anything else halle jonah everyone ate DOWN
My girls loved the movie it was awesome
Lovely remake. Perfectly cast. Made the little girl in me so happy. Phenomenal graphics and cinematography. Highly recommend!
The colors of the underwater scenes were so vibrant.
This movie is amazing . Halle does a wonderful job and the bird and crab were amazing also.
Really enjoyed The Little Mermaid such a cute and inspiring movie.
The movie was entertaining.  It is a good family movie to see and we all enjoyed.  I do wish they would have given more background to Erick.
My daughter really enjoyed it!!  Will definitely see again
Absolutely beautiful phenomenal work. I didn’t think it would be this good and I’m glad it was.
Visually beautiful.  True to the original film.  Haily Bailey was wonderful and what a voice. Melissa McCarthy was so great Ursula.
Growing up with the little mermaid and seeing the live version with it's little twists (no spoilers) is amazing Halley Bailey is the perfect Ariel I got goosebumps hearing her sing.
"With all the negative things I’ve heard, after watching myself, I can’t say one negative thing about it. We loved it!!"
I love the effects and Halle & al of cast did excellent job.
Loved the music! Loved the visuals!  Loved everything!
Loved it. Great additions with all the feel and wonders of the original.
We liked the crab and the mermaid and her daddy
"Acting was awful, the new songs they added were REALLY bad, and I think they changed way too much from the original. The songs from the original movie were really good. That was my only redeeming factor"
"The special effects were out of this world. Better than Avatar in my opinion. The music and singing was wonderful. Even though I knew the whole story, this more than kept my attention. I liked it much better than the cartoon, and I really liked the cartoon. I really enjoyed the interracial cast. The costumes were fabulous and the choreography was wonderful. Thumbs up! Five stars!"
I JUST LOVE HALLE🤍🤍 SHE DID GREAT!!!!!
Loved every minute of it.
"Great movie! I love the vibrant colors. I enjoyed how realistic everything was, and everyone looked.  The only negative was Sebastián was a crab and not a lobster like the original movie, and Flounder didn't look like a flounder fish."
"Acting was not good, graphics were mediocre.  Worst villain performance Ive ever seen.  Save your money, wait for streaming"
Such a wonderful movie!
I loved this movie so much. I grew up watching the Little Mermaid when I was little. If you get the chance to go see this movie DO IT!!! The cast was AMAZING!!!
Halle Berry did a great job!  The movie was aesthetically appealing!  I would highly recommend it!
Great movie! Good story line and singing
Im a huge Disney fan and the seagull character was off they didnt sing all the songs if you going to make it into a live action make sure you make it as close if not identical to the original. Flounder was a skinny little fish. It was subpar at most. Do better
Was so similar to the original! Loved it so much
Definitely a must see!! Halle did an amazing job!!
"It was ok, some scenes were not good"
"I have no idea what the tomato top critics are talking about.  This movie was magical, engaging, action-packed, tearful (in the best way), touching and lived up to and exceeded the joy of the beloved animated version. The perfect movie for the entire family."
"The animation, acting, and casting was great!!"
Movie is 10/10! 3D was amazing experience!!
Wonderful upgrade to the classic version
Absolutely love! Brought up so many memories from my childhood. I was in happy tears and singing along.
"I loved everything, mostly this lil mermaid did not stays living in the ocean and became a human being and accepted by everyone in the castle. Worth all pennies"
"Various things I loved about the film that I cannot even type into coherent sentences at this moment. Lol. However, I will state that Halle Bailey is a STAR, and Melissa McCartneys portrayal of Ursula was phenomenal Incredible work, Disney. Incredible work!"
Awesome movie great movie
Loved the little mermaid 3D
Disney did an amazing job with the music and graphics. Perfect choice of actors!! Great movie!!
"It was a lovely tribute to the original!! Great movie, my niece was dancing the whole time!"
Love this movie. Graphics and singing was amazing.
Visual Effects were exceptional
Loved the music!  CGI was great!  Actors did an amazing job recreating the wonderful animated version. Melissa McCarthy was spot on as Ursula!!
Music and underwater scenes were great!
started off slow but got better after ward. should of waited to watch it on disney+.
The movie was Awesome!!!! Must see!!!
Under the Sea song was so well done.  Ursula and Sebastian characters well done.
Magical and fun! Halle Bailey and Melissa McCarthy are amazing!
Beginning to long. Great movie after it got going
Loved all the colors in the ocean!!!
EXCELLENT!! EVERYTHING WAS EXCELLENT!! I RELIVED MY CHILDHOOD IN AWE!!
Liked add scenes and story lines.
"Love it! Love this version. Love the addition that was added, not too much to interfer... Love the Caribbean vibe and love the built up connection between Ariel and Prince Eric."
"Vocals were great! 
Tech was fantastic
Actors did great job"
"The story was better, movie was stupid because the characters were stupid. Could have been much better"
"For me as a senior,I thought it was the best movie that I've ever seen ."
Great movie.  Kids loved it
Seven year old response.  The ending.  Underwater photography was coo!  The music and the beginning.  All perspectives of a 7 year old!
Really good movie and the story line is amazing and the soundtrack was great
This was a beautiful live action version of The Little Mermaid. The effects were great! I felt like a little kid again watching this movie.
I cried everytime she sang. Every actor gave their all. So amazing !
The movie was so amazing. Me and my daughter enjoyed it very much. Its definitely a must see.
I loved it! Loved the ending when the king showed up to support Ariel and the mermaids represented every nationality!
"The film was a great adaption of the original version! The singing was phenomenal, the theatrics and much more."
I liked the singing. Kept true to the movie and things omitted werent major parts.
"if halle berry wanted me, I too, would fight a sea witch for her."
Beautifully done. Slow in spots but the singing and underwater was excellent. Melissa as Ursala was amazing!!
"So colorful! Beautiful full screen pictures that put you right in the middle of the scene! Awesome!
Im a softie at heart, so it was crying time at the last, but happiness at the ending."
"Phenomenal! So happy to share this with my daughter! Halle was just amazing as Ariel, and you can't really go wrong with Javier Bardem and Melissa McCarthy as Trident and Ursula."
I liked best that it was multicultural.
it was an amazing movie I loved every minute of it
Everything about the new movie was fantastic
I loved everything about the show! Halle did a great job!
"it was really good! casting was perfect, just kind of a long movie, but i will admit that it was very attention focused so it needed to be longer in that case! perfect happy ending and a great live-action version of a classic disney movie"
Halle was everything
Loved the movie beautiful effects and right on
"Loved all the vibrant colors. Took my daughter on a daddy-daughter date, and it was perfect! Halle sang her butt off, and made the whole movie! The inclusion with off of the Kings daughter was beautiful. You couldnt have picked a better mermaid, I cant imagine anyone else for the role! Awesome job DISNEY"
I enjoyed it. Beautifully done!
"I enjoyed it very much, music, cinemetography and story"
I Loved it..i can watch it again
"took my grandkid and hey loved the movie, self serve for their popcorn and soda the experience was great."
The mix of animation and humans was terrific. Great story!
"The movie had great special effects and was great in IMAX. The music was fun and nostalgic, but the story line was exactly the same as the original which isn't wrong, but it made for a more boring experience. The crab was fun and lively, but they made flounder so sad and lifeless. I could have let this one go to disney plus and would have been fine."
"Loved, loved, loved it"
My favorite part when the pelican was rapping that was to cute.
Loved the mixture of animation.  Halle Bailey was wonderful in the role of the little mermaid.  Loved that it was in tune to the original movie!
"Amazing animations and visual effects! The music was GREAT! And in my eyes, the cast was perfect!"
"Loved most of it! However, there is 1 thing that I didn't care for, which is Skuttles being underwater for so long. And it did seem to drag in several scenes"
The movie is entertaining but also a lot different from the original story
The music was fantastic - really enjoyed the entire movie.
"Not my favorite Disney live action remake. It started off very slow and dark, but got better as the movie progressed. But the worst part is that they left Sebastians arch enemy out Chef Louis! That couldve made the movie so funny, so I was very disappointed with that."
The animated version was better.  Ursula and Sebatian were great.  The new songs were good but sort of stuck out as not quite part of the original score.  Flounder looked like a rubber aquarium fish. The movie was enjoyable but not needed.
"Saw movie with our 8 year old granddaughter. Loved it. The effects were superior and Eric and Ariel were adorable. Saw the original with my children , loved it then, thought this remake was wonderful,  as well."
"My eyes, my hears, my god!! After being a fan of the little mermaid since my childhood, I can’t believe they did that to her story! Disney swooped so down on us.."
Great story and music!
I loved it and so did my 33 year old daughter and 5 year old granddaughter. Nothing to dislike
Loved this. I didn't care for Eric's song.  everything else was perfect.
Beautiful movie Halle Bailey and the rest of the cast were fantastic the effects amazing. Thank you for taking us back Under the Sea.
"Halle is the perfect Ariel. She truly knocks it out of the park. The chemistry between her and Jonah is so great and really makes you fall in love with them by the end. Your kids will love it too, they have great musical sequences. Its not TLM 1989 but where they took liberties, they did a good job. Go see it!"
"A truly refreshing take on a classic story. The original songs they snuck in were catchy and whimsical, my daughter loved it! The casting was excellent Melissa McCarthy and Hallie both shone in such a unique role. I can one hundred percent recommend seeing this with children and older friends alike."
"The Little Mermaid is my favorite Disney Movie! I went into this movie with an open mind and it was such a treat! I loved this movie, I found myself dancing along in my seat and having to contain myself from singing along out loud LOL. So as a diehard life long Little Mermaid Stan I was very satisfied with how much of the original movie they kept intact and pleasantly surprised with the changes made from the original that really made this movie its own thing. This was not just some copy and paste of the original (Looking at you Lion King)."
Great animation great voices when singing
I really loved this movie!! It's definitely a must see.
Did not expect to like the movie as much as I did! Halle Bailey absolutely KILLED it! Her vocals are so powerful and clear and the acting was great! I didn't even really think about how Flounder and Sebastian looked. Also Javier Bardem? Fantastic as King Triton. And don't even GET me started on Prince Eric!
"Although the film certainly dragged on during some scenes, overall it was enjoyable. It was a good recreation with a wonderful cast. I will enjoy watching it at home someday with the brightness turned up."
Erics signing sucked!!! And the movie was SO boring!!!
Did a great job at telling the story
10 out of 10! Definitely recommend watching! Such a great remake. They stayed true to the original story but added a little extra that I enjoyed! Definitely going to see it again!
The movie was really good and cute
I loved everything about this movie
LOVE LOVE LOVE it - every minute!!!!!!
"Great  movie! Liked the singing, heartfelt story line and the costumes  were amazing"
Movie was good. One can really appreciate the lengths Disney goes to create live adaptations.
I love that it kept the original story line with just a few enhancements. Halle Bailey and Daves Diggs were amazing!
The cinematography left a lot to be desired. It could not be compared to the original
"Beautiful! Job well done! I was never a fan of the original, this remake made me fall in love in a brand new way."
"Absolutely beautiful movie. Halle Baileys voice is angelic, and Melissa McCarthy shines as Ursula. So many fun moments, and I love the cast diversity!"
Loved it - great movie!!
"Like my old favorite, but even better! I love how they gave us a more realistic cultural context for the story. Being in a Caribbean-like setting enhanced the film, while still staying true to the original movie. They did a fantastic job of hitting those key scenes almost exactly! I would gladly  watch it many more times."
I love this live action version 🧜🏾‍♀️ 🧜🏾‍♂️
absolutely loved it!
Absolutely captivating. I loved it!
"LOVED, probably Disney's best live action remake yet. Hailey did Ariel true justice,  bravo!!!!"
"Absolutely beautiful film that wonderfully holds all of the things we loved of the original, while adding depth and nuance to the characters we know and love. It also has a wonderful Caribbean flair to it that is awesome."
Halles singing is absolutely angelic. For this to be her acting debut she did well. Everyone did a good job bringing the cartoon story to life. Melissa McCarthy played Ursula well. Me and my family really enjoyed the movie
"It's a film for a younger audience. From my 69 year old perspective, it was ok. My 8 year old granddaughter loved it. That's really all that mattered to me. Halle Bailey and Joshua Hauer-King were quite good both with singing and acting. Melissa McCarthy really captured the snarky malevolence of the character Ursula. I never tire of Awkwafina's delivery."
Couldn’t watch this movie. Fire alarm went off after 10 minutes into the movie. I was crushed
Loved every second of it! 20/10 would recommend.
Amazing! Halle Bailey does an amazing job! The cgi was a little ehh but the movie was a great time. Saw it in 4D & had a blast
"Probably the best live action Disney movie we've seen. Singing was great, underwater and above water scenes were great and acting (live and vocals) were great. Halle Bailey was perfection and Melissa McCarthy as Ursula is a treasure. A must SEA movie!"
"It was a great movie, Love it"
"The new material was either hit or miss. Some things worked, and some didn’t. Even though some CGI was wasn’t perfect, there were stellar 3D effects. Also, Bailey and McCarthy were golden and perfectly cast. The Little Mermaid (2023) is no masterpiece, but it certainly is one of the better Disney remakes."
loved the movie everything was perfect my daughter loved it too will watch it again
"Halle Berry is sensational! The iconic music, bright color palette, & story remain faithful to its predecessor. McCarthy nails Ursula while the cast performances will leave you wanting more. Ariel & Eric chemistry felt organic. A good time for all families!"
Loved it start to finish!
Melissa McCarthy was brilliant. Cgi was a little weird in parts. Most of it was magical. Leads were sweet.
"This movie was so good! As a Little Mermaid fan since the age of two, it was so nice to be back in Ariel's story and to fall in love with it all over again. Halle Bailey embodied Ariel and it was truly magical to finally see her as our favorite mermaid! I found myself practically swooning over Prince Eric and loved the depth they added to his character, along with his and Ariel's chemistry! I went in with some reservations and expectations, but I didn't even give those a second thought once fully immersed in the movie. Truly loved the entire cast, and all of the new songs were great additions! I will say that I wish Colleen Atwood had shown out more with Ariel's wardrobe, because it left a bit to be desired with how few outfits she had to wear. Would have loved to see her in a ball gown at least, but especially the victory/seafoam dress when Triton turns her back into a human. To sum it up, in a time where the live action remakes seem almost played out, this one truly felt like a reimagining in the best way! A way that doesn't feel like it was copy and pasted from the original, but instead inspired by and added to the world of the classic tale that we all love so much without straying too far from the source material. One of the best Disney live actions so far, right up there with Cinderella for me!"
absolutely loved this movie !!
"Absolutely genius. The amount of love, care, and attention to detail is just astounding. Fantastic storytelling."
"Loved the movie and the actors portrayed the roles amazingly! As a mom of three red head girls, Ariel is their icon. I just wish her hair was more true red like the original. Otherwise she was awesome!!"
such a fun movie. They did justice to the original and added some of their own flair. it makes me sad this movie received so much hate
"I enjoyed the movie a lot. It was a beautiful picture. It held my attention and it was balanced comedy, drama, romance, it was awesome. Well done."
Took my 30 year old daughter who grew up on and loved the original to see the latest version of the little mermaid she was very happy with the live action remake.
The additional songs by Lin Manuel Miranda were unexpected and great! I loved the spin on the characters!
Loved how realistic it was
Cute and family oriented
"My daughter was pretty upset little mermaid's hair wasn't red. The setting with the movie at sea seemed way different than the cartoon. 
Favorite part was actually Ursula, because she was true to her character and portrayal just like the cartoon."
AMAZINGGGGGG! We loved it!!
It fits the times of todays youth.
Beautiful recreation of the animated movie.  It was tastefully done.  Melissa McCarthy was phenomenal!   A MUST SEE
Beautiful movie to see with the family
I loved it! It was a beautiful film and I enjoyed how they expanded the story a bit more. Ariel had fleshed out goals and there was great development and depth with her relationship with Eric.
It was really good. It was faithful to the animated version. I liked the visuals and the story. It was wonderful
Family oriented movie
"so proud of our little Halle, loved this movie and the graphics were WOW."
"This movie was beautiful. The colors and the music were both mesmerizing. I did think it was quite intense for younger children, but older ones would be enthralled."
This was an exciting movie.  I loved the cinimatography and all the action.
This movie was fantastic! I loved it allthere was nothing to dislike!
It was an Awesome movie for all ages. Absolutely Loved it.
I felt like I was transported back to my childhood. The only difference this time was that it looked a lot like my world. The small changes were cute. I loved it!!!! I can't wait to see it again.
I feel like we could of done without Eric’s singing
It was on point of the original Disney version. Loved it !!!
It was a beautiful movie.
Changing a character that people grew up with instead of creating  new one.
This was really entertaining and fun.
"Beautiful colors, 3D is fun and actors exceptional!"
It was actually a good movie.  All you gotta do is go watch it for yourself.  The only annoying actress was Awkwafina playing Scuttle.
"Didnt like that Ariel didnt look like we have known her to look all this time, but they tried to make everyone else look as they always have. Her acting was well done but she just never felt like Ariel to me and it made me focus on it no matter how much I didnt want to. I Didnt like Sebastians voice nor King Tristans voice/accent which loses its nostalgia for a long time fan.  Cinematography was amazing, and Ursula was well done. But Disney tried too hard to make this movie about inclusivity of races rather than just focusing on leaving the classic Little Mermaid that everyone knows and loved as close to the original as possible like is done for most other live action films.  Sad to be disappointed."
A must see! Disney did a fantastic job of this live version of little mermaid. All the songs we wanted to hear were performed perfectly children and adults alike will enjoy this movie
Halle Bailey did an amazing job at bringing Ariel to life. Her voice is compared to a siren in the movie and it is just that. The songs both old and new are wonderful and catchy.
"Music, production all excellent.  Very enjoyable."
"I loved the casting, story and music. It was very nostalgic.... And especially loved the diversity in this movie. Well done, Disney!!!"
"It was really good! The additional songs were superb! A fun, enjoyable movie."
Very cute  how they did this movie. Seeing all the little girls dressed up like Ariel was adorable. A must see!!!!
My daughter loved it! She said that it was better than the cartoon….racial diversity is beautiful!
I loved the whole got damn thing
The music and acting was fantastic. We enjoyed it from start to finish!
I enjoyed the movie.
The cinematography was amazing! Beautiful shot after beautiful shot! Halle Bailey did an amazing job! Loved the extra background for Prince Eric.
"They cut off scenes from actual movie, like when they got married they didn’t show that, but it was good"
I saw previos and photos and I really wasn’t sure but when a i saw the whole thing I was like ok.
It was amazing!!!! I would watch this movie 100 times in theaters!
"Liked that it had various cultures and was clean, no gay or lesbian relationships to help kids understand what God intended"
"Great music, great story and loved the people who played in it. Going to see it again next week!  Loved it!!!!"
We saw it in real 3D with d box and enjoyed the movie!
The movies was amazing loved everything about it.
"The movie is really good it has some changes from the animated movie, but other than that it’s still a good movie for the whole family some parts I didn’t like was the casting for Sebastian he didn’t sound good and he looked really weird and the way they did Scuttle was wow not in a good way they made Scuttle into a girl and (he) doesn’t look like a seagull he looks like short crane. Halle Bailey is great as Ariel her voice was amazing the music is awesome the music is just like the animated, Melissa McCarthy as Ursula was outstanding the cast was great and there’s a couple of special people that appear in the movie and those people voiced Ariel and Sebastian from the animated movie. I think that this movie is one of best Disney remakes ever I put it on my list at #2 on my list of the remakes I put it behind Beauty and the Beast as the best remakes"
"Great special effects, loved all the actors and music!!"
"Surpassed my expectations, my childhood is complete!!"
"Blatantly miscast!  Played more like a horror story than a fairy tale. Singing was uninspired. Actors were just reading lines. No chemistry between performers, What  are the people in Disney thinking??? Stick with the animated version, Save your 29 bucks! Someone remarked the prince was prettier than the mermaid. Ha!"
It was all around excellent movie.
Music was perfect the pace of the movie was exceptional great acting throughout!
It was great! Beautiful visuals. Excellent choice or actors/actresses for their roles. Outstanding!
"Beautiful movie, my 4 year old and I loved it."
"I loved it! It added to the orginal, it expanded on Arial's and Eric's relationship. It was full of diversity fun and excitement."
Boring just like the original
"The movie was really good. I give 4 stars because some of the singing was cringe, but again, overall good. I might have enjoyed it more if there werent screaming/running children everywhere."
Loved it! The black Ariel added a special touch.
Enjoyed with my 4 year old granddaughter.  She said that it was amazing!!!!
"I loved all the beautiful colors, the music, the love story I loved everything about this movie!"
"Wonderful ,Amazing ,Spectacular 💫💫💫💫💫❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ loved it"
Beautiful movie with amazing meaning behind it.
"Everything was great. the visuals, the singing and Hailey Bailey was absolutely wonderful. This is definitely worth the watch."
Amazingly done. A great take on Little Mermaid. Loved it.
I just loved everything
"This was the best movie Ive seen IN MY LIFE! Halle Bailey was by the far the best possible choice for Ariel. Jonah, Halle, Melissa, literally the whole cast did amazing. You could see the chemistry on screen. Definitely will be seeing this at least 3 more times"
This movie is a great feat of modern movie making. It is excellent. I’m a grandmother and I loved that movie as much as the kids did.
"FANTASTIC! Absolutely the best Disney Live Action movie they've ever made, and while that's not saying much, The Little Mermaid KNOCKS IT OUT OF THE PARK!!

Absolutely incredible movie, would recommend! I cried!!"
"Amazing graphics, engaging, Ariel is sweet and adorable. 
The varied nationalities of her sisters was unusual making king Triton look like a sea whore."
special effects were great! Good story line. Great music and singing!
It was such a wonderful film for all ages! I could watch it over and over again.
Great remake of the original
I love it and Ariel get her voice back
"Its not just Disneys best remake but its One of Disneys best movies ever made. Absolutely beautiful, I cried several times. Halle and Jonah as Ariel and Eric totally deliver full romance!"
Loved it! Great additions to the regular story.
Classic animated films need to be left alone. The anticipation that this would be as good as the original was real.....but dissappointed.
This movie was AMAZING!! Halle was great!! I’m so glad they chose her!! Her voice is PERFECT for this role and she is stunning! 10 outta 10 would watch again!
Movie was great we took our grandaughter and we all loved it!
"It was GREAT! Very nostalgic! I wanted to sing along to all the songs, and I loved the new songs!"
"I thoroughly enjoyed it. The movie was really great, and the casting was spot on. Disney did a fantastic job."
ABSOLUTELY LOVED THIS MOVIE... I LIKED HOW THEY DIDN'T CHANGE THE CHARACTERS KEPT THEM THE SAME WITH A MODERN TWIST... ..AS AN ADULT I ENJOYED WATCHING ONE OF MY CHILDHOOD CLASSIC MOVIE AND TOO SEE THE KIDS REACTIONS AS WELL....
"The movie was 10 STARS, MY girls love it and can't stop talking about how much they want to be a mermaid"
It was decent. About what I expected.
I loved that the roles of Ariel and Eric where wished when it came down to defeating Ursula.
"Horribly long, was too long for the kids, not true to the first Little Mermaid, grandkids and grownups disliked the new songs"
The movie was awesome! Halle Bailey did an amazing job! Love every minute of it.
"This is the first live action Disney movie I've seen that I felt was actually necessary.
The emotions of this story are sooooo much more impactful when told with live actors"
"The music, the story and the ACTING !!"
the rock scene was horrible
"It's just a typical Disney Little Mermaid story.  It's just that the exciting song but not exciting atmosphere, and awkward acting..."
EVERYTHING! The cast was amazing.  The music was great!   We had lots of fun singing along :)
Very well done and entertaining.
The movie had a good set of meaning of showing love even though a person is different regardless of their life raised environment
"Enjoyed it so much, I saw it twice. Once through regular viewing and 4DX. 4DX was the best experience and made the film even better. Highly recommend."
Halle was great! I also LOVED Melissa McCarthys performance. Well done bringing this fictional story to life.
Music was great we watched in 3d it was a good picture and experience fun to see the recreation I still have the vhs but the old picture I could not get my child to watch thanks for remaking this film looking forward to more remakes of Disney
"Halle Bailey is a revelation as Ariel!  Her performance was touching and tender. The love of her father was so evident in Bardem’s portrayal. Daveed Diggs and Awkwafina kept the comic relief going as the cooky Sebastian and Scuttle. I would have loved to have seen Lizzo stretch her acting chops as Ursula (as was rumored) but Mellisa McCarthy, is always wonderful and was appropriately scary.  Disney should be applauded for having the courage to make such a culturally relevant and sensitive portrayal of the story.  This version will be loved around the world and will become classic!"
"I never saw the original, but this was worth seeing.  I loved the acting! I loved how this movie had a very diverse cast! No one was left out, so one could identify with many of the characters. The singing was great!! (Halles voice was made for this role!)  i saw this in 4DX (which i highly recommend). This is just a good movie that had me talking to the people next to me! The storyline was good  we laughed and sometimes had a tear- but we all cheered at the ending..Melissa McCarthy surprised me.Love her!  But i never even recognized the king (played by Javier Bardem). I think the cast was perfect.i look forward to seeing my Disney!!!"
"Invigorating , the graphics was so great and amazingly detailed. Loved every bit of the movie."
Best Disney live action I’ve seen so far.
the movie was fantastically amazing I like how they reprise part of your world at least three times it was perfect in each scenario that it was played. Sebastian was the funniest in the movie each character flourished wonderfully and my God Halle performance 👏 I highly recommend this movie to anyone newcomers old fans of the '90s film it was really beautiful I had me in tears towards the end.
I liked the setting and the singing!
Super excellent movie. we a great twist. Have the right amount of improvement . Amazing job!! I wish no nonsense comments bashed the amazing work of art !!
"Really enjoyed this movie! Stays true to the 1989 film in so many ways, but also fees free to explore things a bit more. Good balance of originality and faithfulness to the source material. I love how they handled Ariel and Erics relationship in this version! It took things deeper and was really sweet. Vocals were fantastic as well. Very cool camera work during the songs too. I had a few little things I didnt like, but they were mostly nit-picky. Overall, very enjoyable film!"
This was an awesome movie! I personally think that it was a great movie that the whole  family wil enjoy!
"Seen this movie 3 times now! And planning on seeing it more. Beautiful film, Halle the perfect Disney princess."
It was a great live action movie!
Fantastic live adaptation! Even better watching in IMAX.
Disliked the voice of scuttle. A lot of talented and unique voices to use and was disappointed.
"Amazing movie! Great visuals. Great music. Entertaining, cute and funny!"
"This isn't a good movie. Ariels hair isn't even red. It was too long. It needed to shave about 40 mins off. The designs of flounder sebastian and scuttle are just bad. the new songs are atrocious, and the old songs are poorly redone. They lacked the fun and joy the original had. the acting was bad except for Ursula. the changes to the plot made for disjointed storytelling. Ariel lacks any real motivation. The movements of the mermaids looked off. I give it a 2/10. wait for streaming. Even then, don't bother just watch the original. Don't WASTE your Money"
"This is my favorite live action remake of the Disney animated movies.  I was totally enthralled with all of the characters.  Halle Bailey and Melissa McCarthy, as well as the whole cast were absolutely outstanding."
I liked all the details and how it looks like we are in the movie as well
"This was an excellent choice for the family. The colors popped out at you, while the songs were upbeat and cheerful. It had plenty of cute moments that made you giggle out loud."
it was funny and very cute. my 3yr old niece really enjoyed it 🥰
Beautiful! Heartwarming! Almost had those happy sentimental tears at the end that come with all those extra hormones having kids. They blended the scenes and music from the original to this so artistically. And our main character was perfect! So pretty and youthful looking.
"The songs were good, moments of great graphics but it was terribly slow paced for children."
"We saw this film in 4dx. Halle Bailey was an incredible lead, and Melissa McCarthy’s Ursula was fantastic!!! The new songs are adorable and hilarious! Awkwafina was amazing as well!!!"
"Loved it, even the new songs! I had a couple of editing issues, but performances were great, and the Colors! And Alvin Ailey Dance Company even got into it!
Wonderful!"
I loved it!! So cute and even better then the original
Halle Bailey and Melissa McCarthy save an otherwise BLAND Disney retread.
Loved the sea god. Perfect timing. Almost shed a tear.
My daughter and I personally loved the movie. The songs were great and Halle Bailey took the songs up a notch with her beautiful renditions.
"Loved everything, from beginning to end!! Were going to see it again!! A Must See!!"
"This is the best live action Disney movie so far! Every change works well and develops the characters more. Halle Bailey is the perfect Ariel and she shines in the role. Gorgeous costumes, music, acting, setting, and cinematography!!"
Very well done! The whole family enjoyed from 5 years old to 92 years old. It was also a clean movie.
I it was a good movie and it’s also funny movie
Absolutely LOVED this movie! They kept the story like the same and only added a couple new songs that were so perfect for the movie! 10/10 recommend!!
It was great I loved it in 3D my kids loved it to we had a great time too
Best Disney live action movie!!!! STUNNING!!!!!
My 3 year old and I loved this remake and the new songs added!!
Great movie. They kept true to the original story but with a modern adaptation. Some new songs but it still has the Disney enchantment of the first movie. A little Mermaid for today and Disney nailed it!
Everything was soo diverse and the message in the movie was soo clear! A mermaid that looks and sings like an Angel from Heaven! Halle was Amazingly breathtaking! What a wonderful site to see!
Beautiful movie with a wonderful lead. Similar to the original movie with many changes here and there that make it very refreshing and funny.
OUTSTANDING! 🤩😍🤩 #OUTOFTHISWORLD 🎶🎶🎶
"Amazing production! I had sweet nostalgia, but i was also pleasantly surprised with the changes that were made. I loved it, my daughter loved it, and the rest of the audience gave an ovation at the end of the movie."
Before going to watch it 6.5/10 after watching the movie 8/10
Did not disappoint! The cast NAILED IT!!
This was good for us millennials and great for our kids.  I loved every second of this.
Forgot to give it 5 stars.
It was much better than I expected. It was true to the story and the music. I liked the new songs as well. The underwater effects were excellent!. I got a little woozy during the first underwater scenes.
"I loved this movie saw! Myself and Daugherty enjoyed seeing so much diversity and a mermaid that looks like us. Also, it was great singing!"
The movie was amazing!
Kids and I loved this movie. So much better than the original.  Halle was amazing and her voice was so so good!!!! Highly recommend this movie. May go back and see it again. Kiddos were entertained the entire duration of movie
I loved the movie everyone did an excellent job
"The little one said, ""10 out of 10 she definitely recommends it!"""
"Just didnt have the acting I expected. The pow. But it was overall good. Our showing had a glitch twice that ruined it at key times. Lets make our theaters nice again. So good,  I wouldnt have missed it."
Wish they had created new songs.
It was really good I give it an 8/10
Loved the cinematography and the music! Didn’t really love the girl vs girl narrative but I get it.
"It was an excellent film. Colorful and fun , the way life should be. I loved it. Halle you go girl."
Best remake since Cinderella i say third best. Jungle Book. This then Cinderella moved down one.
Love everything about this movie!
"Amazing visuals, vocals and acting!!!! A wonderful live action adaptation 🤍🧜🏾‍♀️"
"I thought the movie was very well made.  Seeing it in 3D really made it enjoyable.  The underwater effects were great!  I would encourage my friends, especially with younger children/grandchildren to see it."
"This movie was sooooo good . The acting , singing , the effects. Halle did great ! Melissa did great they all did great. I’m glad I saw this"
Halle's voice is amazing and the movie overall was great for people of all ages.
"ABSOLUTELY AMAZING MOVIE!!!!! watched it twice and need to see it a third time, so incredible. halle is amazon and her chemistry w jonah is out of this world. visual effects r also amazing!!!!"
"Excellent cast, especially the beautiful Halle Bailey. The visual effects were amazing I felt like I was really under the see. Melissa McCarthy stole the show. I felt like a kid again."
I love it! Brings back all my childhood memories! Brought me tears of joy!
Very good for all ages
Great film. Imagery was out of this world!! Halle and the rest of the cast were awesome.
Everything about this movie was amazing. Halle Bailey and Jonah Hauer King absolutely sang and acted their hearts out. I have already seen the movie twice
I felt like I was five years old again (30 years later) watching my soon to be favorite film. Time has repeated itself. Thank you to the wonderful cast and production for making this possible!
Fantastic! Great movie!
singing was as breathtaking as cinematography
Ms. Halle ATE! and didn't leave a crumb behind.
Better than the original
Amazing adaptation! Disney finally gets it  hopefully this continues.
Love the inclusiveness! I gagged when the mermaids came to the surface and they were all different colors and sizes. Soundtrack was pretty dope too!!!
"A beautiful and touching telling of the animated film, expanding to more fully explain some of the weaker plot elements of the animated film and joyfully bringing into to 2020s. Loved every moment and note of it. The cast is spectacular and SPOILER ALERT  pay attention in the market scene for the food seller, Jodi Benson, voice of the animated Ariel.  Couldnt ask for a better way to start your summer!"
it was beautifully made.  My grand daughter and I enjoyed very much.
10/10 highly recommended
Everything was good A1
A decent effort. obviously not as good as the original but Halle Bailey does an impressive job as Ariel but this movie belongs to Melissa McCarthy as Ursula who knocks it out of the park.
Not the best remake.  liked the mermaid.
I liked everything! Amazing visuals! Amazing acting! Love! Lots of hotties!
Loved this movie a lot. Definitely a must see. I agree with the critics are saying about this movie being really good.
"Really wonderful movie, my whole family loved it"
I liked the fact that the movie could be tailored to little boys and girls and adults as well. All the actors and actresses played their part
"Absolutely amazing! 
Recommend 8years and up. 
Music and cinematography was spectacular. 
And it was NOT too long"
Loved the diversity. There's no racism under the sea! The color under water was so vibrant wish it was on land as well. Halle is much better than I expected. I was not disappointed.
The movie was so perfect! They had every detail right and it was amazing.
Very fun and colorful! Classic songs plus new ones from Lin Manuel Miranda that will become classics!
"The acting, visuals and sound design were phenomenal and it stayed true to the original. Great movie, I’d recommend"
"Loved l was able to follow the script and sing a longs.  
Loved the added scenes with Prince Eric nd the voiceless Arial. 
Disappointed in the gentleness of King Triton. 
But overall lm still in love with the little mermaid Movie. 
Ursula was amazing"
"Meh. I was SO looking forward to this and while it brought moments of laughter and joy, it fell a little flat. Loved Ursula though,  thought she was awesome! overall it didn't stray from the original story line,  but there were moments I would've savored more and others that felt too slow for what was going on.  I'm glad I saw it,  but won't care to own it or probably ever watch it again lol"
Wonderful movie! We loved it
"The movie gave me chills…especially the ending. To see unity between human and mermaid, if only more humans yearned to do this with one another.🧸"
It expanded upon the story and characters without taking anything away. Allen Menken returned for the score and once again helped capture that Disney magic!
Live  action was so beautiful
The movie was exceptional Halle Bailey was excellent and should get an Oscar for her portrayal of Ariel
"underwater scenes, new songs by Lin-Manuel"
Halle Bailey and the whole cast were amazing!!! She was the prefect Arielle!
absolutely beautiful movie
"Parts were a little slow, but it was good overall"
It was super cute and really interesting to watch I couldn’t look away
I had high hopes and was let down terribly.
My wife and I loved how it was extremely realistic and we could understand all the words in the songs they sang.  It is a wonderful movie for older children and adults.
Among the better of the live action remakes with a star making performance by Halle Bailey and a deeper look into the romance between the two leads further justifying the film’s existence.
"Incredible!!  Disney did amazing things, especially in 3D!! My 4 year old loves it as well!"
"I didn't expect to like it as much as I did, but I can gladly say, I LOVED IT!!!"
Great movie!  Beautiful to watch!
I LOVED EVERYTHING THAT MOVIE HAD TO OFFER. IT COULDVE BEEN SO HEART WARMING . IM ASTONISHED FROM THE BEGINNING TO THE END
"An amazing movie, went to see it with the family and we all loved it. can't stop singing the songs and the cast were amazing"
Excellent Movie for a remake of an animated version.
Watched in 3 D. The graphics were amazing.
Beautiful movie. Halle and Melissa did an amazing job.
I like the fact that we were able to exchange our tickets last min cause other things happened definitely recommend using this app.
I loved this movie.  It has the spirit of the animated movie while expanding on the story.  Halle Bailey sang the heck out of those songs.  Truly enjoyable.
"It was okay, I was very disappointed that they didn’t give her a a nice dress and why would they cut off the part where her dad gives legs. I was just very disappointed"
Really long but it was a good watch. A lot of unnecessary singing.
Very well done.  Great cast! Musical parts were fanatic.  I highly recommend watching!
loved the visuals but the violent scene was a bit heavy for kids.
Actors were excellent!!! Movie was done with excellence!! Superb!
"I thought it was a great movie, my 4 year old like it as well although one part was a little scary for her!"
"Overall I enjoyed it. With the exception of the giant Ursula scene, the CGI was outstanding! I guess they went over budget with all the ""under water"" scenes they didn't have enough to make Ursula more realistic. But it's the Little Mermaid."
"The singing performances of Ariel, Ursula were excellent. Both their acting was great as well, as expressive as a Disney cartoon would get. Not many actors for previous Disney remakes were able to capture the cartoony facial expressions."
great special effects
Like the scenes that were added made more like Ariel would do.
Amazing!!! Halle Bailey was phenomenal
Better than I imagined and you have to see it in the 3D version bc then youre really under the sea!
The actors and story was not the best. I wouldve loved to see more of the original. Not the best Disney remake.
This movie was so beautifully made Im so happy for Halle!
Everything was amazing.
Loved the the actress playing Ariel!!
"They did an absolutely phenomenal job remaking this Disney classic! From the opening scene to the last moment, I kept gasping, laughing, crying. The visuals were beautiful and the songs (classic and new) were so fun! I took my daughter to see it and I'm so glad I can say this is the first movie she ever saw in a theater!"
The movie was just ok. I thought the animation was good. It was a good looking movie to watch. The characters were ok. Some fit and some didn't. Overall I think if you're a fan of Disney films then you'll want to see it so you say you did but it's just an okay movie.
Brought back great memories from the original Disney cartoon.
"Disney Did It Again, Another Great Live-Action Film! Halle Is Gonna Win Her Oscar!"
Story is encouraging little girls to swim.
"Enjoyed the Ride. There were some things that were changed that were unnecessary, some new songs that seemed unnecessary, etc. but overall the movie gave what it promised. The special effects were well done and brought you into the world. The acting was well done and dealt with a difficult prospect (of having a conversation with a puppet crab). Family friendly time!"
This was amazing. Loved it.
I loved all about this movie!!!
Would see it again! It was excellent!
Perfect casting. Amazing music and acting. Wonderful visuals
"Great classic scenes and songs! A few new cool scenes and songs too, overall such a nostalgic feeling :)"
Kept to the original while still bring something fresh and new!!! Love love loveddd it!!!!!
Amazing !! This movie took me back to my childhood. I was smiling from ear to ear and dancing throughout the entire movie. I literally had tears in my eyes. Halle did a great job !!
I mean as a young African American woman I was hoping that the creator would have her project more of her ethnicity. I was hoping for a bit of sad and culture. I didnt see any of it. I did love that there was strong diversity. It was great start. But I was really hoping for more.   Her singing as always was phenomenal but they should definitely had HER come more out.
"Well done, beautiful."
"Pretty good live action Disney movie. CGI is a little rough, but it’s still a good watch."
"This was a well-done, clean, and enjoyable movie perfect for the entire family to watch. My children grew up with the original classic, and last night, I brought my 79 year old mother to view this one. Even though I enjoyed the show, watching the joy it brought to her face was priceless. 

The music was fantastic! The only heads-up I'd give aren't related to the movie itself. The previews add another 25 minutes to the time, so be prepared for a long show. Also, I am not sure if it's just this theater, but this is the 2nd time the volume was so loud it hurt our ears. We put tissue in our ears to help muffle the sound. Next time, I will bring ear plugs."
This movie in all aspects was absolutely fantastic. 3-D just topped it. Halle did a fantastic job as Ariel and Melissa McCarthy absolutely slayed the role of Ursula!!! Loved this movie from top to bottom. Im a 90s baby so Im all for original but the creators of this movie did a beautiful job
loved the 3D version
Outstanding! Well done Disney. New family favorite!
The movie is an amazing live version of the original. The original is my favorite movie and this one did not disappoint. Halle Bailey is amazing as Ariel! They did a great job casting. The one sign they could have left out was Eric’s. But overall great film. All these people who have given it low ratings are not being genuine and probably haven’t even seen the film.  But it’s hard to see past your hatred. Great film and a must see.
Beautiful movie! Fabulous musical talent!
"Great movie!! So moving and nice to watch another princess that looks like me ! BRAVO , seen it twice so far!"
It was so much fun! Don't believe the naysayers. Loved the performances and songs. Everyone was well cast.  I was astonished that there were so many quiet children in the showing I attended. They were riveted. There was even a baby who never made a peep. I didn't even know the infant was there until the lights came up. I'm a grown woman who now really wants a mermaid tail.
The whole movie was amazing!
"It was an Amazing film for any age.  I took my great great nieces to see it and to watch how attentive they were and really drawn into the storyline brought a smile to my face.  There were so many talking points to explain to them that good and evil are always present, but we have to believe that good will prevail.  The film showed how differences creates prejudice against others, but once the heart is open, there will always be acceptance.  Maybe, this world can imitate life through Disney eyes!!"
The film was well done. My family and I lauged through out the film. I was hoping that Disney wouldn't mess up this live action movie and they did not disappoint. Very good!
"Easily the best live action Disney movie! I cannot begin to describe how absolutely beautiful, breathtaking, and extraordinary it was! On top of that, every single role was perfection!"
Waste of time and money they should stop making more Disney movies
It was wonderful!!!!
The Little Mermaid was an enchanting movie and I shed a few tears of happiness at the end.
"i loved this movie! Halle as Ariel, blew me out of the water! she is great, and was meant for this role. the whole movie is just simply great! the music, magic, everything! my inner child is definitely extremely happy."
"Halle was honestly a delight to watch in this version of The Little Mermaid. Her voice is stunning, her acting was very limited due to her character so you can’t judge her acting based on this film. Chemistry between the characters felt real in my opinion. Everyone was cheering for Halle’s moments. It felt good to have people support her and not bash on her like most people are online. She deserved to be recognized and respected"
"Wow! What a great time watching this. Definitely the best of the live action reimaginings but also a great movie on its own! Halle Bailey was a knockout as Ariel and perfectly brought her innocence, curiosity, and determination to life from the animated movie (along with her incredible voice). The rest of the cast were all great, especially Jonah Hauer-King who really elevated Prince Eric to much more than just a pretty face. His and Ariels romance felt so earned from their friendship built on shared interests and hopes. The new songs were also fun (Halles For the First Time was a standout sequence in the film — what a great way to give Ariel more songs and show her excitement and nervousness for the human world). The story changes felt welcome here and only added to the intensity to add to the stakes of Ariels journey. 

The CGI was also great, nothing at all that looks bad that it takes you out of the film. The very slight changes to the original songs are so minimal that you truly dont even notice them."
"The Little Mermaid was very well done! It took a bit to shift from anticipating an exact redo of the original and to see this new version as its own movie. I really liked getting more of the back story about Prince Eric. Overall, very nicely done and Halle Bailey as Ariel was a fantastic choice!"
"I really liked this movie! Halle has such an amazing singing voice! Even though Ive seen the animated version a million times I was still anxious about what would happen next. I liked most of the new songs, but there was 1 that was a little cringey for me. All in all one of the better Disney remakes!"
"It was everything I ever dreamed of!
Truly phenomenal, in every sense of the word!"
"Just a retelling of the original with no real further character development or plot line.  Eric's song was cringe worthy.  I especially didn't like the animation of the mermaids and Ursala looks like she is straight out of the Exorcist at the end.  This falls way short of Malificent, Cruella, or even Aladdin.  Disney is capable of so much more..."
"I liked the movie.  The realism/animation was nice.  I wasn't sure how they would pull off the animation in real-life but it worked. Without giving away anything, the ending actually made me tear up a bit. I was 'on the fence' with going, since the critics didn't like it, but, sometimes they get it wrong."
It was colorful and had lots of great music. My grandchildren all loved it.
"My daughter LOVED this movie, and so did I. Think it is a great family movie. Great reenactment of the original."
Nice little Caribbean tone to the mermaids land experience.  Melissa McCarthy nailed Ersula's image.  Perfect Ariel and Eric characters.
Haille Bailey was sensational! Side characters were good. Music was great!
I loved the Movie.  It was designed for Adults and well as kids.  Halle Bailey was wonderful.  I also like Jonah Hauer-King.  they were both great.  The movie keep my interest from start to finish.  A definite must see!  5 Stars.
I loved the movie!! It’s the perfect love story
My daughter loved itsweet movie!
Liked it even more than the original! Didnt love the actor for king triton. And why did all the sisters have to be from different countries? Did love it overall though!
"Amazing movie, outstanding acting on Halle's part, she completely embodied Ariel as a whole.  Halle definitely solidified why TLM is my favorite Disney movie."
"Great Movie! Wonderful cast, great story and cool effects!!!!!!"
Disney never fails.  Awesome Ill never stop watching this kind of movie
Best Mermaid Movie Ever
Hailey did amazing! The little mermaid was never an interesting movie to me as a kid which is why I gave 4 stars. Same story line so it was okay. But Hailey as the little mermaid made me want fins! The graphics were amazing. The singing! No one more perfect for the role. Shes a princess at heart & her energy glows.
It was awesome. Great Movie
"I am someone who is obsessed with the original. I even have an Ariel collection. This live-action remake made me so happy. I honestly loved it! Was beautiful and enjoyed the new scenes they added. My only sadness was how little pretty dresses she wore. In the original she has the beautiful pink drink, the blue dress, the sparkly dress, and her wedding dress. We only got a blue dress and then the same dress but white later on. Just something that made me sad but doesn't change how much I enjoyed this movie"
"The scenery was beautiful and amazing.  The story plot was good but not enough music or romance.
All in all, very nice."
They put enough of the classic for the fans from the original and what they added to the story line and the new songs was incredible
"Absolutely Beautiful and it is a experience that all families, those who love the classic and those who would like to experience for the first time, to go through. The songs and sequences were top notch and the entire movie was a cinematic masterpiece. Two Giant Thumbs Up!"
I really appreciated the following of the orihinal storyline! Halle's voice was phenomenal! I was a little put back by the darkness & lack of clarity with the animation. Overall I enjoyed the movie & would watch it again.
Everything was exactly the same as the original it made me laughed it made cry it made me reflect about how differences continue to separate us when we’re all the same
The best live action remake of a classic Disney film. The original was my favorite when I was a child and now this version will be my favorite as an adult. I really enjoyed Halle as Ariel she was perfect for the role! The entire cast was great! I loved the music and animations as well.
"It was okay, the movie kind of explained the discrepancies, missed quite a few key moments for me. The ending however, had me rolling in laughter, great way to ruin a moment Disney lol."
Loved everything about this Movie! We enjoyed it very much @
The acting and singing were top notch!
Much better than I expected & wife loved the movie. Surprised that Disney didn't sneak any LGBTQ stuff into the movie which was great. The changing of the ethnicity of a couple of characters didn't hurt the movie. Solid!
Very enjoyable retelling of the story with solid CGI and score. Original songs were great but the new songs were forgettable.
People weren't the same skin color as the original cartoon disney movie
They left out A LOT of iconic parts from the original movie. I saw it in 3D and it made the animations look slightly better
Haters gunna hate. This movie was great. Guess goin woke doesn’t make you go broke. It was an outstanding version of the classic little mermaid story I’ve enjoyed since since I was kid. Disney’s version is much more heartwarming than the original story. I will be seeing this again.
It was my granddaughter first time in a movie theater and at 20 months old she was in awe of the pretty fish as she called her. The movie had beautiful scenes and although it was long the storyline was great as always. She was sleep by the middle of the movie but still the pretty fish was all she could talk about to her mom. Great remake!
I like how it was almost spot on with the actual movie.
OMG Halle was AMAZING. Like I knew she was gonna be amazing but she was BETTER THAN AMAZING. I love Melissa McCarthy. She was also AMAZING as ursula. I actually didn't think awkwafina was that bad. This is probably my fav live action remake.
The added songs were so unnecessary. Ocean shots were dull and the Under the Sea scene was very underwhelming as well. Ursula parts I loved. Halle has a beautiful voice but her talking scenes  felt forced.
"Best Disney live action adaptation hands down! Everything about this movie felt so fresh! Loved it so much! Had me crying, laughing & left me so happy."
Was happy with the story line
"I loved it so much! I laughed and I cried, its the perfect movie I recommend it"
It was a pretty good movie really enjoyed. The kids had fun.
I loved Halle as the role and despite “controversy” she was amazing and completely fit Ariel. love her love the cast loved the execution it was great
This movies was amzingggg! Love every minute of it!
I loved it! And i love how it’s about Ariel wanting to explore the world and the human experiences and not just being boy crazy like the original movie. 3
I absolutely loved it! Never saw the original animated one (I’m 24 F)  but it was really a great movie
"I absolutely loved this movie. The songs, the actors, scenes everything was really wonderful. Truly was a great movie."
"This movie was well done! I loved the singing, acting and the colors in the movie! I loved that it was an all race movie.  I would definitely watch it Again!!! Very well done. The entire theater clapped several times during this movie!!!"
We absolutely loved it. Got the D Box seats. Totally worth it
Great movie and graphics ! I would definitely watch this movie again. perfect movie for little ones and adults. The only thing I would change is making flounder brighter.
"LOVED!!!! One or two spots could have been trimmed, I wished there would have been more singing because the performances were so so beautiful. The movie was gorgeous and so very special. THATS WHAT LOVE is DISNEY STYLE!!!! Destroy woke Take a seat DeSantis & learn more about love, instead of hate! That will be a much better example for our children & the world. God bless Disney for helping us see love as the winner!"
A must see! This version is like the classic little mermaid and full with action it's emotion and funny   I was stunned also the audience clapped at the end...
The graphics were off the hook but it was too long. Some scenes could have been cut to develop continuity with the story. CGI was amazing as were the colors.
It was slow. Loved the actors. Felt forced that all nationalities were being represented in the movie . . . took away from the continuity of the movie.
Went to see it for the second time. Loved it even more this time.
Ariel was always my favorite princess growing up. Always a little girls dream to be a mermaid. I am 25 years old my my inner child was happy with this movie. I loved that they did so much similarities but a little different from the original movie. Will forever cherish this in my heart. My childhood thanks you for this movie
Great balance of keeping the classics that everyone loves and adding new touches that make it fun to experience it again.
Great CGI Special Effects
Best Live action Disney princess yet
Absolutely loved the movie
All in all it’s a good movie. When you compare it to the original though it didn’t live up to the same level magically. Musical numbers were lacking in my opinion.
I loved everything about the movie!
"I enjoyed all of the movie, it had great theatrics. The graphic designs & colors was amazing. Hats off to Aerial (Hailey B) great performance. The movies was packed with all cultures & ages."
Amazing special effects.  Captivating scenes.  Loved it !!!! Great movie for adults and children.
It was ok and it didn't help that people take their children and don't supervise them let them run around yelling and crying asking to go home but they keep them there.
The actors selected for the role were almost exact.
This movie was beautifully done. I loved the diversity of the characters and the storyline.
Gave new meaning to the original film.
Great cast and music.
I loved the music and the actors were diverse and fantastic. Cinematography was on point.
"Movie was good, but I expected it to be more colorful. Also a little too sing-songy for me. But the acting was great and we had a good time."
"I had hopes for this movie, it was a let down. The sets and location and cinematography were the only things I liked. Too many unnecessary story changes which were meaningless and hurt the pacing."
My wife loved the movie!
It was an amazing movie loved every second
excellent. loved it.
Absolutely Spectacular!!!! Halle ate that up!!!!!
"Incredible movie! So much nostalgia. They took a lot of scenes right from the original. Very diverse casting. A lot of heart and visually STUNNING! 

Also…HALLE BAILEY IS ethereal looking. It’s hard to take your eyes off of her. She’s just that good and beautiful. I’m seeing it again."
Wonderfully done!!! My children grew up with Ariel and now my granddaughter can sing along to this amazingly fun and adventurous remake. Haille was Perfect!!
A must see exceptional graphics beautiful songs
Loved the movie! Halle and all the other cast did an amazing job.
So fun and amazing! The acting and visuals were incredible!! Love it but the ending was a little rushed.
Halle Bailey is amazing :)
"Sebastian was a great character 

Flounder way too skinny

Ariel missing red staple hair color"
I grew up on Little Mermaid and I thought it turned out super cute. My girls loved it as well. I didnt really notice much change in lyrics as was mentioned before watching.
"The CGI graphics were poor & choppy, looked like a 10 year old movie.  The acting was pretty bad by Aerial she just seemed awkward.  Had high hopes but was pretty disappointed.   Pass on this movie, stick to the original."
It was perfect. They kept the magic of the original and added some. See it in 3D!
"It was so good, I have no complaints/dislikes :)"
"Music and acting were great. There’s parts that are different from the original animated version, so that was interesting."
Ive watched it 3 times. Animation can be a bit off sometimes but story line is precious and the music is chefs kiss!
"I absolutely loved it!! The cast was remarkable. They created it as close as possible to the cartoon, but it superceded... BRAVO!!!"
The animation was amazing. Halle looked beautiful and sound amazing!!
I loved all the characters and how they came to life on screen. My Children loved all the songs and of course the fight scene was epic!
The animation and raw music reminded me of old school Disney when dumbo first came out and Alice in wonderland. It is now my #1 favorite amongst ANY Disney live action movie PERIODT!!!
I loved everything about the movie. The little Mermaid was my favorite movie as a child. Happy to see it in Live action. The performance was top tier!
Halle did an amazing job! No actor could have played the role better.
Halle Bailey was absolutely fantastic. Best Disney live action remake.
Everything. Best movie seen this year
"Halle Bailey was perfect, the animated was my favorite movie growing up. As an adult it's been replaced with this. It is amazing, they couldn't have done any better."
We went and saw it twice just to give it an extra boost along with everyone else. Once in regular and once in 3D. The only other time I saw a movie twice in theatre was for the original Avatar. This movie was really enjoyable and beautiful to watch and Ariel and Ursula were awesome and loved the cameo from the original Ariel.
"The colors, cast, music, sound affects, acting skills and other fine details were all perfect! An absolute must-watch. Very beautiful to see all people being represented."
Wonderful movie!!  Storyline stayed very close to the original.
Super great!! Halle Bailey was amazing!!
"Halle Bailey did a great job playing Ariel, would have wished to see flounder & scuttles look more like the cartoon."
I left early. It was boring and unnecessary.
"We Love the movie ,The colors in the movie was amazing and the story line was awesome !! 
It's a MOST SEE !!!"
see it in 3D it's makes the movie way better
"I loved the entire movie. Start to finish! Cant wait to see it again!! Loved the entire cast, Ariel, Ursula, Scuttle and Sebastian. Love, love, love!! Must See for all Little Mermaid lovers!!"
"Loved the movie, beautiful and hilarious story."
"The Little Mermaid was so good!  It was the first time the Disney live action remakes have made sense!  This was beautifully crafted and performed.  Halley Bailey has an amazing voice and elevated the nostalgic songs of the original.  It was a tad long, but not terribly so.  I loved Sebastian and Scuttle!"
I was afraid they would mess up this classic but I loved how they did the movie it was amazing !
Very similar to the original. My kids and I really enjoy it.
Amazing! Halle did such a great job. It was my first time seeing TLM movie and I loved it.
Love every moment I thought it wasnt gonna be as good as the original film boy was I wrong great movie
The leads voice was wonderful.
"Love everything , it was so magical, the movie is already one of my childhood cartoons from Disney that is my favorite but the movie was also incredible and I will say the 4DX also made even more powerful . This movie was tremendous, perfect person you chose for Ariel and Eric , love everything , including how the characters were all chosen with a delicacy, marvelous."
Absolutely wonderful! Loved it. Halle was fantastic!
Great ! Amazing special effects . Very realistic. Great acting.
"Halle is Ariel. The movie is perfect. The songs were awsome, beautiful movie"
I love the graphics so cute
The scenery was very vivid and beautiful! The storyline was great!
"Halle: Talented, brilliant, incredible, amazing, show stopping, spectacular, never the same, totally unique, completely not ever been done before!!!"
Definitely an absolute MYST SEE
Love it great movies!!!
Was not too long appropriate for older kids.
"Halle is the best part of this movie, If you're a true og Ariel fan you'll appreciate and love how well Halle honered Jodi's version while also giving her own unique quirks and qualities to the character to further expand Ariel's overall personallity. Something that the original admittedly did fail to do, hence why you see so many "" critics "" and celebrities trashing Jodi's version so easily and carelessly. If you have any issues with this movie, Halle most certainly can't be one."
The movie kept close to the original script and songs with a few surprises. People were able to sing along. It was very nostalgic. The graphics were nicely done. The characters did a great job.
There’s was a ton of great new additions but the things that stuck out and bothered me affected my opinion more than the new things I enjoyed. It’s a good movie but I’m glad for the lower priced Tuesdays cause if I’d have seen it on a full price day I’d have been disappointed
It was excatly like the original movie a good must see
It's a fun movie with good music. It's nothing amazing and the performances can fall flat at times but it's entertaining all the way through
Everything..Halle and Jonah were amazing!!
Beautifully diverse! Thankyaaaa!
Seventh time seeing it loved every second of it just as the first RUN dont walk RUN to see this movie
"It was toooo good watched it at night with a friend. Singing fantastic, was honestly funny at some moments (which i didnt expect from a childrens musical), and Lord Almighty—Halle Bailey is heaven sent. Anyone who complained about her being a mermaid all had one thing in common but let me keep my mouth shut."
Just like I've always dreamed it would be.
Loved it  will see it again
"Brought back memories of the animated movie. Enjoyed with the kids, and now with my significant other. I would watch it again."
ariel was perfectly casted!!! cute movie
I loved watching this movie with my 10-year-old and reliving my childhood memories of watching the original film.  I could watch it 100 times and still love it!
Loved every part of it ! Music was fireeeeee transitions were impeccable and characters played tf out of their role
I love everything about this movie
Wonderful movie. Soundtrack is definitely going to be on repeat.
Amazing! Beautiful visual and songs
"I loved it! The music was great, it followed the original story line so well, and the few additions/changes only added to how awesome it was. My grand daughters ages 5, 9, and 11 all loved it as well."
It was wonderful and I loved all our cultures brought together as one people 💖 beautifully done!
Super cute movie for the little ones to see.
"It moved very, very slow. Clearly a lot of covid filming so the shots tended to be all one actor alone and it felt very isolated. The shots tended to last longer than necessary, lots of long ocean shots or underwater shots that didn’t add to the story and were not needed. I also thought the Eric falling under the sea witches spell was poorly done."
Very compelling. Ariel is a wonder. Thank you Rob Marshall.
My daughter and her friend loved it.
"The casting was very amazing and seeing it IMAX had the colors and songs sounding ethereal. Only complaint is that Popcaan wasn’t Sebastian. Other than that, perfect movie"
it was very well put together and I loved it even though they changed things it was a great movie well done
"missed that iconic les poisson scene with chef louie, overall a good movie not fantastic, Disney should create new content instead of trying to remake classic films."
"Beautiful movie. Long in places, but overall a fun experience. Halle Bailey is a star. Jonah King is a great leading man. Definitely going to see it again."
"Loved it, the new music added a new dimension to the story! I absolutely loved it!"
Loved the music and animation
It was so amazing getting to see a little mermaid who resembles my daughter she was in complete awe when she saw her!!  Thank you It was everything we hoped for and more!
Great Movie true to the classic
"I really enjoyed the movie, it was good all the way through. She really played her part."
"THE LITTLE MERMAID (2023) justifies its existence by having Halle Bailey bring Ariel to life. She's bound to shoot for the stars after this. McCarthy eats up her screentime & Diggs is joy as Sebastian. The newer songs are hit or miss, but classic Disney magic's present at points."
The movie is really good.
"It was really good, I just didn’t expect them to have changed some things."
Don't play with it! Halle did her BIG ONE! Don't sleep!!! I'll be watching it again!
It is too long and very slow.
The movie was amazing. All of the old charm as well as some new surprises and characters.
Awesome movie!!! 3D graphics were the best Ive ever seen!!
"Overall wonderful movie, dont go in with any expectations. Take the movie as it is!!"
"A must see in 3D! I think Sebastian and Flounder could have been done better, but the rest of the characters were fabulous. My favorite scene was Under the Sea, it was very colorful. I really enjoyed the movie!"
"Live action done beautifully. The scenery, especially under the sea scenes were amazing. My two young grandchildren enjoyed it too!"
"Halle is the perfect Ariel and, while there were some interesting choices with styling during some songs, every bit of the movie was faithful to the classic and then pleasantly surprising. My daughter and I adored it and, im considering a second trip to theaters to watch again!"
This movie exceeded all my expectations. So beautifully done. I want to see it again already!
Good casting and music. It comes alive!!!
Loved the movie. Music and voices were amazing. Despite a few changes from the original cartoon version we all enjoyed it. Best Disney live movie remake
This was such a great live adaptation! Ariel was INCREDIBLE. Ursula/Vanessa actresses made an EXCELLENT team. The CGI was beautiful and the story followed the original so perfectly. I loved the changes made as well and 100% recommend this.
"Disney did this movie absolutely correct. Between the watching this film Regal 4DX platform, the audience’s real-time reactions, and all other departments involved with the production and financing of this movie this has to be the closest I have seen to a perfect film. 100% certified fresh for sure. Extremely entertaining for the entire family!"
The Prince Eric actor's performance during his singing was a little too Broadway. It took me out of the movie a bit. Awkwafina was great in her role. She slayed with what was given to her. Melissa handled her role as Ursula very well. Halle's portrayal drew strong emotions in such a positively immersive way. I normally don't watch movies twice. I would watch this one again.
I actually liked this one better than the original.  The song where Awkwafina raps is hillarious.
I love the Ariel movie it has the exact scenes from the cartoon movie
"While there were a couple of Disney surprises, as in, i dont remember that from the original movie, for the most part it was very true to the Little Mermaid as I remember it."
I loved everything about this movie. Chloe Bailey did her thing.
"DEFINITELY A MUST SEE MOVIE 100,000,000 out of 100,000,000.!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"I couldn’t even pretend that I got tickets for this movie to see with my daughter. This outing was specifically for me and my daughter was invited. I loved this updated take on the original Disney classic. Anytime Halle Bailey opened her mouth to sing, I would get chills! She and the rest of the cast did an absolutely marvelous job and I fully intend to add this movie to my collection once it is given an at home release date!"
The original animation is fun and nostalgic. The live action added some depth to the story line.
"Yes, loved the movie.  It was little loud in some spots but overall, it was great."
I loved it! Especially in 3D
"Loved the 3 d glasses, felt like I was included in the movie.  Gremovie."
"The film was visually stunning, especially in 3D and Halle Bailey's voice was magical. Loved it, wish I could give 20 stars."
Halle Bailey was absolutely wonderful! Very fun adaptation
"Our girl was great in this role. 
A must see. I'll see it again in 3D."
Loved it! It was fun to see the cameo of the original Little Mermaid.
We loved the movie. It was amazing. My daughter and nieces loved it.
Something's are just better left alone
Fandango sold me tickets for a movie in Spanish waste of money
It was much like the original movie but also had some new twist too. Thoroughly enjoyed it and will definitely want to see it again!!
It was awesome! We loved it!
Very well done!!! went with 7 lil ones and they all loved it. Even the boys...wow...Solid work here👍🏽👍🏽
Really good movie. Love Eric and Ariel their relationship was really put together well. 10/10 for me.
Loved it.... Best Cinematography I have ever seen.  Halle Bailey was the perfect Ariel.  Melissa McCarthy was great too.  The prince....... so handsome.
Excellent adaptation of the animated original. Melissa McCarthy was priceless as Ursula! Halle Bailey nailed it as Ariel and the story line was virtually untouched. The cinematography was outstanding. A must see in the theater for full effects.
It was amazing. Saw it on 3D. I was singing to mostly every song. Chloe was excellent and sound wonderful. Well put together. Went with my closet friend and she started to cry towards the end. So touching. Loved it!!!
Colors/underwater scenes
I loved the ending and the middle
The visuals in the movie are so beautiful.  It is a perfect nod to the previous Disney version.  The cast was perfect and the vocals flawless.  I cried 3 separate times and cannot wait to see it again!
I loved it. It took me back to the sea. The cast was phenomenal. Ariel sang beautifully. CGI was off in some places but really nice during under the sea.
Halle Bailey did soo good! amazing movie!!
The 3D movie screen was down so we had to wat h the regular version. It was still great!
Great Ariel! Missed the chef scene and song.
Absolutely amazing!!!!
I loved the singing. It was a beautiful movie.
"Me and my kids enjoyed it, my daughter took her doll and sang so loudly during part of your world...my youngest said she is so excited for it to come to Disney + so she can watch it everyday!!"
"So, so good! Casting, acting, scenery, music - all amazing.  So good I cried again and again! Must see!"
This was a awesome movie and the storyline was great. The actors were superb! The scenery was great and animation  was awesome as well. Just a great little movie!
Ignore the NEGATIVE reviews and go check it out yourself! It was a very good movie and this is coming from a little mermaid fan.
It follows the animated version really closely.
It followed the original movie but the music was beautiful! Acting was wonderful also!
Absolutely loved it!!!
A GREAT REMAKE! Very close to original! Everything about this movie is a must see!
Loved music and special effects!
Took me back to my childhoodAMAZING!
Me & my family loved it !
"The Little Mermaid is a delightful and visually stunning film that transports the audience to an enchanting underwater world filled with magic, music, and adventure.  The entire family loved the film."
This movie was amazing. I love you halle
"Not bad, better than live action Lion King but not better than Jungle Book"
Great Movie! Everyone coming together is Beautiful!
"Beautiful effects, great music and a wonderful cast. It is enchanting!"
it was a great movie. ☺️☺️Very well made. ❤️. the songs were heart felt indeed. I will definitely go and see it again for sure♥️♥️♥️. Colors were Spectacular as well !!! Especially with the witch Ursela!!!
I would reccomend this movie. Anything Disney's I love.
"Brought my granddaughter to see the movie and it was her first time at a movie theater.  She loved it, as did her mother and I.  Great characters.  A little longer for a four-year-old, but never dragged.  Melissa McCarthy was great as Ursula, and since I love Daveed Diggs, his portrayal as Sebastian was wonderful."
It was so awesome to experience in 3-D! It was a really nice wholesome family movie!
The CGI was absolutely believable! Singing was exceptional!
Very entertaining and close to the original animated  one. Still awestruck with how they made the mermaids and underwater so scenes so realistic. Kudos the special effects people. The scenes of the storms on the sea were quite thrilling. Enjoyed it immensely and can't wait to see the next real life remake of a Disney classic.
My daughter and I loved the movie!! It was partly cast and gray all around!
"Very well done. Im not sure if its for small children as there are some scary parts. I like how the movie stuck to the original. The girl who played Ariel was very good, and the Prince was terrific. Very colorful with a huge assortment of sea animals!!!  Really enjoyed it!"
very enjoyable to watch
Excellent movie! Casting was outstanding!!
I was afraid that another childhood favorite would be ruined like The Lion King - but this great! I loved it! All the characters and the message was lovely. Great job!
I liked everything about this movie!
The movie was so amazing.
I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. Especially the underwater scenes. They stayed true to the plot not like other movies adding unnecessary bs. But I've always enjoyed the little mermaid movies. My daughter didn't like it though lol. The only negative comment I'd have to say is is that she looked a little animated while underwater but that's a given/expected.
"I loved the theme of accepting others and allowing your child to love others and pursue their dreams in life.  Great music, action, and overall picture imaging."
I loved the music. Halle Bailey has the voice of an angel! She truly embodied the wonderment naivete of Ariel. I also loved the message at the end between Ariel and Triton. I am going to see it again!
Personally I have no idea why the rating are so low. I went with my girlfriend and we both agree that (in our opinion) it is the best live remake Disney has ever made. Definitely worth going to see in theaters!
It just was a feel good movie. It ended on a high note.
Loved every second of this movie...my 4 year old granddaughter loved it too...Highly recommend seeing this version....I even cried at some points...
"This movie was great!!!  The “remake” was perfect in all ways!  Truly, enjoyed!!!"
Really disappointed.
"This movie met ALL of my expectations! The casting was phenomenal, the acting was superb, Halle's voice is EVERYTHING!"
Fantastic remake. Did the original justice in so many ways.
This movie was so much fun and still true to the original. must watch!
It was pretty close to the original and there was some added new songs that were good. It was good for a life action remake.
Very enjoyable movie!!
"The acting, casting, & the way they executed the whole story was great for someone who wasn't sure they could pull this 1 off..the bad reviews are all wrong. If someone has a problem with it then they had a personal problem beforehand either way, because I loved it & am very excited for when it's available to own.."
Loved the new bits (like Scuttle's song) AND the parts that were true to original. Bailey was beautiful and that girl can sing!  Plus Prince Eric actor was great and Ursala (Melissa) did a fabulous job at being mean and scary. And always love Akwafina and Daveed!
It was such a great movie. Halle Bailey was great. I really enjoyed it.
Movie was very good loved every minute of it
"Solid 8.5/10 go take your kids to see it, they’ll love it."
Good special effects.
I just love The Little Mermaid anyway and thought they did a great job
"One of the best live action remake to date.  Must see movie for sure, you won’t be disappointed!"
Halle was an excellent choice for Ariel!
"THERE IS SOMETHING INSPIRING ABOUT SEEING A MOVIE ON THE BIG SCENE THAT YOU WONT GET AT HOME.  WE SAW THE MOVIE IN 3-D (WHICH HAS COME A LONG WAY) AND IT WAS AMAZING WHEN UNDERWATER, NOT AS AMAZING ON THE LAND SCENES.  THE SONGS ARE AMAZING ALONG WITH THE VOICES OF THE SINGERS. i WOULD GO SEE IT AGAIN."
Great movie! My daughter and I enjoyed it!
The singing and acting were great!
"This installment was beautiful and I appreciated the inclusivity of all the mermaids. The story line was awesome as usual and the acting was amazing! It felt like a short movie but it was 2hrs. Maybe I was enjoying it too much. Halle did a wonderful job as Ariel! The crab Sebastian played by Daveed Digs was awesome and Awkwafina as Scuttle was totally hilarious. Overall, bring your kid to watch this movie. Its enjoyable for both adults and children. I laughed a lot."
The movie was amazing and glad I was able to come see it with my little one.
"Loved the entire movie.  Halle Bailey was outstanding, and the other actors were equally remarkable.  What a masterpiece!  I only went to keep my wife company, and I am looking forward to seeing it again!"
"Halle Bailey was amazingly tender, hopeful, and strong.  Definitely worth a watch to re-live this updated Disney classic and see it a new light.  Scuttle (voiced by Awkafina) had me laughing out loud in the theater.  Enjoy!"
Great new version of a classic!  When taking younger kids be aware that it is over 2 hours.
"This movie is fantastic!!! I saw it in 3D, what an experience. Do yourself a favor and go see it, take a friend or two with you. The most diverse movie of all time.  Halle Bailey showed she is a gifted singer and very talented actress."
It was absolutely amazing! I enjoyed EVERY MOMENT OF IT. It captured my 3 year old daughter's attention. 5 stars for HALLE!
"Its was a wonderful experience, very well made"
"Ariel and Eric were amazing. Very long film however, could have been shortened."
"loved the movie, my children and nieces and nephew enjoyed the movie"
I like the fact that the movie had all ethnic groups of people.
We loved It. It was excellent and welll done. Everyone in the theater clapped when it was over. A must see
We were so happy to be able to enjoy this charming retelling of the classic tale. The effects were wonderful and all characters were well acted. I highly recommend it to anyone.
"Thank for asking My favorite was the the bird the crab and the fish.
The best part was bring everyone together"
It was great movie. The acting was superb. I really like all the different representations in the movie.
It was a brilliant update to my favorite Disney movie. Halle Bailey as Ariel was more than my heart could take. Melissa McCarthy as Ursula was the best cast role ever. I cant wait to see it again.
I really loved the new live-action version.
"I liked the 3D experience,  it was like I was in the movie. Review from my 8 year old granddaughter.  She can't wait to see it again."
Best Disney live-action movie to date! The casting was perfect. Daveed Diggs stole the show as Sebastian the crab. The music was outstanding - better than the original. Halle has such an incredible voice! I have nothing bad to say about this movie. It exceeded my very high expectations.
Casting was beautifully done!  Live action forever!
Loved The Little Mermaid! The original animated version was my daughters favorite movie so I was familiar with the story. The live action version nailed it and also ratcheted up the emotional tension. I kept tearing up at the beauty and drama I experienced. I highly recommend this movie!
Love the fresh Caribbean focus. Hailey was phenomenal as Ariel!!
"Disney needs to get back to it's roots. Screw that woke crap and the diversity crap, just tell the story and quit worrying about peoples feelings."
Amazing film.  The musical performances were excellent.
"Soundtrack was really good, but it just felt uninspired and flat. It was nice seeing the visuals, but it's got no substance in the story."
"Oh my gosh!! Little mermaid was sooooo good. I was even ""that mom"" and took my 5 month old baby. He was locked on it (then fell asleep lol). 
But really. Bravo!! The movie was great"
"Although Halle's voice nailed it, her acting skills fell very flat! She just looked confused and scared the whole time. Skuttle's voice was extremely hard to listen to, and it's sad they completely took out the chef scene. And poor Flounder! What happened to him?? And Ariel's hair - why was it orange?? They changed the look of many characters and not for the best. 

Ursula nailed it! I can't believe Melissa McCarthy's voice could sound like that. and the makeup and special effects were all done amazingly."
"My childhood brought to life, it was an incredible refresh of the classic in live action. The CGI of the underwater world was incredible and encapsulating, with amazing performances from Halle Bailey, Melissa McCarthy and Awkwafina in roles I’m convinced they were born to play. It’s a must see!"
It was a cute movie and I loved all the sea creatures and underwater scenes. The only thing I didn’t like about it was that it was a bit too long. Other ten that I enjoyed it.
Blah. Couldn’t buy in to any of the voice actors. Some things don’t need to be re done.
"Awesome movie, the story line add ins were amazing and really brought the story to life!"
Me and my daughter loved the movie. She kept commenting on how beautiful Ariel was! Good casting and my 15 year old son even enjoyed it.
Beautiful movie! Halle Bailey really played the role of Ariel so well. I loved every minute of the movie.
I loved how they kept it as close as possible to the original movie. It was amazing.
My adult daughter and I went to this movie.  Little Mermaid was her favorite movie growing up.  We both LOVED this new version.  We both thought all of the actors/actresses were spot on.  Can't wait to see it again when it becomes available to stream on Disney.  We both highly recommend.
The movie was beautifully made. Didn't love some of the songs.
"I love a musical, so I knew I was going to love it! My granddaughters were up clapping, dancing and singing with each musical number...my heart was light with love watching them watch Ariel just be..."
"I really enjoyed the innocence of this movie. Was very pleased to see there wasnt a work agenda. I have stayed clear of Disney and its products for a couple years now, but decided to give it another chance. Disney can win back my business if it stays on this track"
"We absolutely loved the new live action version of The Little Mermaid.  It was our daughter's first time seeing a movie in an actual theater.  She was captivated the entire time and has been asking to listen to the sound track non-stop ever since!

I think this was by far the best live action adaptation of an animated Disney film.  The cast selection was on amazing and Halle Lynn Bailey was outstanding as the titular character.  Her voice and performance were enchanting.

I can't recommend this movie enough!"
Excellent… Beautifully done. Loved the new songs
"I felt all the emotions that are typically missing from the animated version.
It was great!
I plan to watch it a few more times. It was that good!"
We absolutely loved it. We loved that you didnt change it but the little add ins made it better. The scenery was really so real looking
"The movie was excellent.  They stuck to the story line and the cgi was amazing.  Disney,  actors and creators created an outstanding project."
A really great movie with great singing and acting
"Great graphics, great music, great story, beautiful mermaids and funny crustaceans"
"Beautiful imagery & suspenseful even if you've seen the cartoon version, it's sill thrilling."
The cartoon was better
The MOVIE was EXCEPTIONAL!! BUT THE THEATER WERE FREEZING  EVERYONE IN THERE COMPLAINED HOW COLD IT WERE
Halle Bailey was the perfect choice for Ariel! A true Mermaid Princess!
I have always loved the cartoon and so have my Granddaughters. To bring it to life madecit even more special. The graphics were so realistic. I definitely recommend the 3D version.
I really wanted to like it.
"This movie was amazing, the kids loved it!"
It mirrored the animated version which we loved. The new songs were great.
"Love that it stayed true to the original, just a bit long - probably could have cut some of the extra songs."
Great and cute movie.
I thought it was an exciting movie. The characters were very well portrayed. Alot more action than the original cartoon. Love it.
So good! Great performances from Halle Bailey and Melissa McCarthy! A Definite must see if you loved the little mermaid growing up!
"Great to see this live action remake of a cartoon classic, featuring a diverse cast. For a parent, the underwater scenes are like a trip to the spa - very relaxing and beautiful."
Loved everyone but Sebastian really.
"It was fun to reminisce about fun memories of the original. We took the whole family. Everyone had a good time, teens to children."
Cinematically were great. Kept all classic songs with a few new added in .
"I really loved the fact Disney did not change the storyline too much the graphics were very cool the music, the actors and It had its funny parts as well. I remember seeing the Little Mermaid in the morning before school when i was younger, and to see it now as an adult as a movie with the kids made me feel like the kid again."
"Loved the actors, happy Disney stuck to the original storyline, visuals were stunning, and the music was beautiful!"
My boys and I loved this movie! It was entertaining and beautifully made.
The voice was not as good as the original. Ursula was fantastic. The pigeon voice was very annoying.
black girl magic my daughters loved to see someone like them as a mermaid as Ariel weve always seen her as white girl with red hair but to see brown skin and locs(with a boho style) was everything BLACK GIRLS ROCK!!
"AMAZING!!!!!!! Loved every minute of it! The only thing I wasn't satisfied with, was Flounder did not look like Flounder. Other than that, it was perfect!"
Very good overall - but some lines from original omitted
"I loved this movie! Surprise beginning, Surprise endings  Although the storyline is basically the same storyline as the animation version, there is so much more visual affects that adults will appreciate. I’m not sure how much the pre K age would tolerate this movie. The length may lose the pre K’s attention. The family seated next to me had 3 children. Dad and 2 of the children did fine but the youngest ((maybe about 5 or 6) talked and fidgeted, made her mother leave the movie twice, and finally wanted to sit on her mothers lap who was sitting next to me. There is no way Mom enjoyed this movie. She would of been better off going to the movie arcade instead of disrupting everyone around her. She was very apologetic and polite so I don’t fault her for her taking care a her daughter. But it was distracting as I was on the end seat and they had to get out by me every time. This movie is made for the whole family including parents to enjoy. No profanity, no nudity, just sweet music everyone recognizes and a feel good feeling. I originally was to see it in IMAX and 3d but that theatre system was down so had to se the movie the traditional way. If you have the choice for IMAX or 3d. Choose one of those options. I feel the special affects would have been spectacular."
if you grew up watching original animated Disney films you will love this life action version of The Little Mermaid. I feel like they stay true to what made this movie so amazing to me as a kid. Wonderful acting and even more wonderful singing!
CGI was amazing! Both grandkids loved it and my daughter and I loved it too. There were some intense moments so I wouldnt recommend for kids under 4 or those who are very sensitive. It did run long for a kids movie-ours had to take a bathroom break.
"I was honestly skeptical of this live action film, but it felt so close to the original — and better! The graphics were AMAZING and the actors casted were perfect. The length was just right. Overall it exceed my expectations. 5 stars!"
"I liked that Movie follows the org story line. 
I didnt like them changing the main character I think they should have made her look like the org Ariel"
"Beautiful movie. The music, costumes and actors did amazing."
Casting and acting was awful.
"Bad acting, too politically correct"
"I loved the Little Mermaid. The acting was subtle, not overdone, the singing was excellent and the settings were beautiful, especially the under water scenes. Well done."
"The Little Mermaid remake was a enjoyable movie, with great music and beautiful visuals. However, the presence of young children in the row in front of me were talking and fidgeting throughout the film which became a distraction. Overall, I would recommend the movie to fans of the original, but I would advise parents to choose a earlier showing if they are bringing young children."
"Some parts of the movie was very entertaining, the singing was awesome.  Movie felt longer than expected."
"I love the mix of ethnicities and Halle was literally perfect for that role. It was the perfect reenactment of the original.  All the actors were amazing.  Melissa Mccarthy is good in EVERY role she has ever played. The actor that played Eric was perfect. It was all so perfect.  I really enjoyed,  so much! Bravo to the team that put it all together!"
The sing arrangements were better than ever
"It's was amazing, especially in 3D. I love how they brought in a variety of nationalities and have it a new twist and look. Ariel a.k.a. Halle Bailey has the most amazing angelic voice, just beautiful."
"Mesmerizing visuals and beautiful talent Halle is a spectacular actress. The cast was amazing and multicultural. My 4 year danced and sang , this was our second time watching this movie. We loved it so much"
"What a wonderfully fresh and artful way to tell an old story. Halles performance as Ariel was wonderful - she was beautiful, so darn cute and she nailed both the innocence and determination of the character. And her vocals - oh my goodness just flawless like an Angel!! There was humor, the music made me dance in my chair, the animation was phenomenal. Ursula was exactly as I remembered her. I could literally go on and on. Fantastic job to all involved in the production of the new Little Mermaid!"
"They are missing key music such as a good version of Fathoms below, daughters of Triton, and Les Poissons. I didn't mind the new additions, but missing those songs really disappointed me. The movie was fun, though the story line did not feel as fluid as the original. 

Sometimes you just shouldn't mess with the classics."
Surprisingly enjoyable movie! Lots of diversity in this!
Beautiful and true to story
"I didnt know what to expect going in. I really enjoy the movie. This was a great remake. Disney did a great job with inclusion, I was pleasantly surprised."
Production of the movie was very well done. Enjoyed the entire thing.
I felt it didn't compare to the original animated one..
Worth watching for Melissa. That’s all.
"I saw no difference between the last movie , im disappointed GMA AND DISNEY made it a black and white thing.
The cinematic etc were very good, and Ursula stole the show!!"
"Movie was great, it was enjoyable, and Halle gave an amazing performance. Her singing was stellar and would definitely watch again. I will admit, some CGI parts were a little iffy, but it doesn't derail from the whole experience."
Honestly it was an great movie. Simpler like the first but yet different. It's an movie for all kids not just little girls. As an adult I enjoyed it also.
Great movie for kids
"Only thing missing that I was so looking forward to was the chef scene. Its been one of my favorites since I was almost 2. Chef Louie singing Les poissons, followed by the chase would have been a great scene. Alas we got a high school musical version of Eric singing to the ocean"
"The acting is not so great, and the story is a bit plain. I know that they followed the original one, but since it's a live action, they should adapt it to be realistic. I didn't see how Ariel got to be in love with the prince during the boat scene, which led her to save him, then chose him over her own dad. And the number scenes were kinda awkward for me, the acting didn't sync with the animation. lastly, I wished they could have done better with Ariel's costumes when she was on the land. Her outfit didn't suit her, and she had been wearing the same outfit for 3 days in the movie! (Even though her got wet from falling off the boat scene)"
"Excellent movie, heartwarming movie even for adults"
"Loved the music, storyline, acting, cinematography ! It was FANTASTIC!"
"Great live action adaptation of cartoon, really enjoyed the new songs."
"epic remake, killer soundtrack. must see im XD!!"
"Vivid visuals best seen in 3D. Successful upgrade from animation to live animation, with a couple new songs that fit perfectly into the original storyline, with intelligent updates to the script and lyrics. Talented (and beautiful) actors, voice actors, rendering and direction. Both"
Super cute loved the mix up of the movie different parts
Sad about a song that was taken out from the original but love the ones they added in.
I absolutely loved it! The visuals were fantastic too. Loves the little twist given to some events.
Much better than Mulan
"Great movie, with great people. Must see movie."
Halle is phenomenal and her voice is incredible! A couple of extra songs they added kind of felt like filler. But overall great adaptation.
"Please do not read some of the fake reviews. Many are upset because Halle is playing Ariel- racism still exists! Anyway, this movie is great! I loved everyone in the movie. Melissa McCarthy is wonderful, Halle’s voice is amazing, the young  man that played Prince Eric is just amazing- I loved it all! I want to see it again. It is so cute,  has some funny moments and just… great as the original! For real, go check it out for yourself!"
"After years of waiting for this film to be realized with millions of others. There were some great portions and aweful choices made in this film. I cant say too much without ruining it. For the most part it hits all the marks, but so many little things could have skyrocketed this film to its true full glory in the heavens! Simple fix: why o why couldnt Sebastian and other cast go up and down in thier voice and add some life to a very real looking creature. It was all monotone and one note! Like if they were speaking even while breaking into song! There was no inflections or nuances that made us laugh and fall in love with them like the animated movie. At this point its all fantasy looking real as possible but that doesnt mean take the simple magic and warmth away. Also the PACE of the film is too rushed for me! Why did it feel like a barely 1 hour movie!? The movie was a bit over 2hours but it went by super super fast! It was wayy too fast paced for me. There needed to be a bit more time in the big singing numbers: part of your world should have been bit longer, poor unfortunate souls, and under the sea needed all some extra zest it was too bland. Melissa McCarthy plays Melissa McCarthy dressed up as rsula she needed to eat up and truly be RSULA yes the villain we know and love. But she gave a lack luster performance and played herself, again. And I LOVE Melissa, but for a film this gargantuan its no time for games we needed rsulax1000 nothing less. At times I thought she sounded drunk! I liked the wallowing in misery parts, subtle things she did. When it came to give it her all she held back some so that balance was off. Then the entire movie seemed to try hard to balance real effects with fantasy effects in the cgi world. Please with how much money Disney has they EASILY could have balance better. Scenes were just way too clean and tidy underwater! Its the ocean not a perfect crystal clear float around the air village. It was missing its grandeur! That the original had. The underwater scenes needed more grit and dust to look real. That would of helped the cgi, it would of been an easy and great fix to make fans truly feel they are in the real ocean. And tons of issues with costumes. Thats a whole diff review. Overall fun to watch and was a good story they just missed so many marks that could of easily been fixed. Enjoy."
"Loved everything about this movie.  The music, acting, cinematography all first rate. A very entertaining and moving story."
"Must see, great movie indeed."
Beautiful film for all ages!
"Halle was the perfect Ariel. At first I was against the casting, but then I saw her in the live action & it completely changed my mind. Beautiful voice, great acting, perfect Ariel."
Great starcast and presentation. Very engaging.
"Loved it. The intensity and beauty of the underwater scenes are absolutely amazing and this was not the 3D version. Also, the soundtrack is wonderful. While I have never seen the animated version I recall hearing that there were some violent scenes. The live version is packed with action and perils."
"Great visual effects, casting. A tinely remake ot a classic. Halle Bailey is a beautiful star with voice of an angel!"
"This live action remake was phenomenal. The original movie was my childhood all-time favorite and I really believe that this did it justice. Halle’s voice was truly made for Ariel I don’t think they could have picked a better actress/singer! There were so many aspects of the movie that gave me nostalgia as they were just like the original, but there were also many new ones that I thoroughly enjoyed. I really liked getting to see more of the connection between Ariel and Eric since we didn’t get too much of that in the original. I also love that Jodi was in the live action! I would absolutely go see it again!!"
"It was incredible, we watched in IMAX 2D and it was an experience I highly recommend to everyone, especially those who have their doubts about this movie. Disney succeeded in bringing this story to life in the 21st century. The casting was phenomenal and the off screen crew made the entire movie amazing down to the last detail. The realism is a shock factor initially but once you let go, it’s incredible what they’ve done when you pay attention to the details. Halle Bailey was the perfect choice for this role and it’s heartbreaking that people can’t see past the skin tone of the characters from the original animation and just embrace and enjoy the film for what it is - a modern and inclusive adaptation to a classic Disney Movie. It was truly a magical moment watching all the young black girls dressed up in the theater excited for the movie, and I can only imagine the feeling their mothers (and fathers) had. I felt an overwhelming amount of emotions during this movie because of how beautiful and seen people feel from watching this, including myself. - To anyone who may be upset by their choice of casting, please reflect on why you feel so much resistance to something so insignificant for your life but which is actually very beautiful and powerful, especially for so many people. -  Disney did a phenomenal job of taking the story of Ariel and bringing the details full circle. Instead of simply focusing on another basic love story, we actually get to see Ariel’s personality and individuality a bit more, as well as Eric’s. We now have a clear story of their falling in love, as well as the emotional dynamics of everything as the story unfolds. As much as it is a “scene for scene remake” at some points of the movie, it is also a deeper dive into the story but with beautiful aesthetics, scenery, videography, and a fairly altered story line as well. There are a few parts in the movie that I would have personally changed but nothing that altered my perception of the movie overall. The ending of this movie was breathtakingly emotional especially for anyone who has felt in their life that they can’t be who they are or follow their hearts - without the risk of feeling like they will be renounced by those around them. You just won’t get that level of emotion from the original movie and that’s one of the reasons why this movie is so amazing and powerful - and why people who are upset about the differences should “let go of their idea of what it should be, and just let it be” - and watch how beautiful it really is. If that’s you, I assure you, it won’t disappoint and hopefully you can see why it’s so important this role is played by Halle."
"The whole family really enjoyed it!!! This movie was one of the best adaptation movies Disney has ever made and of all time!!!!!! This version of the movie had so much more depth, substance, and relevance for our times. It was truly authentic and had very high quality acting from a great and diverse cast. Thanks Disney!!"
the BEST movie i’ve watched in such a long time. made my heart so happy & cried at the end
The BEST remake every. I had to hold bk tears. Loved
A+ Congratulations!!
I took my daughters (ages 14 and 9) to see this today.  They loved it and don't have a ton of exposure to the original. I was a young teen when the original movie came out and this was such a joy to watch with my kids.  I just have one complaint -- Lin: How could you take out Les Poissons for that super cheese Prince Eric number? But Daveed Diggs as Sebastian was a stroke of brilliance.
We loved the entire film
I loved the first couple of songs they really reminded me of growing up watching the little mermaid say what you want but I'm a grown man that will sit and watch this movie again. Great family movie.
Beautiful. Magical. Halle Bailey did such an amazing job in this movie!!!
Loved it. Ariel was perfect. The music was great and it was refreshing to see the different mermaids.
I really enjoyed the movie. Beautiful ending
So far the best live action Disneys done
Best made live action Disney!!!
Loved everything about this film!
Absolutely amazing I cried 3 times
The music was fantastic and I loved the inclusivity.
"Absolutely wonderful 🙌✨ I felt emotions while watching, Halle Bailey is SUCH A GREAT SINGER 🧜‍♀️                                               UNDER THE SEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA"
It was incredible through and through. Beautifully done.
"I love how they kept it similar to the original movie with some fun add ons. Music, costumes and graphics were on point. Definitely recommend!"
I thought it was much better than the animated movie back in 1989. The effects were very well done especially Ursala's movements. I just didn't care much for the actress that played Ariel. Her performance was okay but she just doesn't come across as an Ariel. Still I would see it again.
"In the land of live action Disney remakes, this is not the worst. I would say 6.5 out of 10, which in these remakes is actually a good score. The Little Mermaid is my favorite and so I went into this critical. Dont go into it critical, go in open minded, its not a bad movie. Ive seen in multiple times now haha. This stays pretty true to the 1989 classic, with some additions from the Hans Christian Anderson fairy tale that it was adapted from, as well as some traditional Mermaid folklore. If you love the Dark tragic fairy tale, you will like this, if you love the 1989 Disney version, you will love this, if you love mermaid storys you will like this. New songs are just meh. I like Erics song, and the additional reprise to part of your world, which made me cry. This film is fun, its beautiful and Halle Bailey incase anyone was worried, is Ariel. Shes almost perfect, the same goes for most of this cast. Working with a subpar script holds them back. Ariel and Erics chemistry is magical and romantic and Im so glad its been added on to. Where this film fails is everywhere they attempted to make it modern or change things. If something is broke, dont fix it Disney!"
The cast were fantastic ! The songs brought some nostalgia with a twist! Love every minute of it!!
I loved everything about it!
I loved the movie very funny exciting. It took me back to my childhood the little mermaid is my favorite movie.
Great family movie! The adults enjoyed the movie as much as the kids!
"This movie did not disappoint!  It was charming and witty. The music and story stayed true to the original cartoon version my family loves. Halle Bailey, Melissa McCarthy, and Daveed Diggs as Sebastian were my favorites."
Absolutely loved it. Best Disney remake of all.
Very much like the original. Loved it. Brought back memories. The theatre played the sound too loud or I would have given it 5 stars.
It was excellent!!!!!
The movie was awesome
This was phenomenal! I can’t wait to watch it again!!
Amazing music and performances!  Wonderful multi-ethnic cast!
Absolutely fabulous movie!!!!
"Quite possibly the best Disney live-action adaptation to date. Halle Bailey is the perfect Ariel even when she can't speak, she is so emotive and you can really feel everything she is going through. Plus, her voice is absolutely beautiful. The updated storyline adds more depth to Ariel and Eric's relationship, and I love the new songs. The underwater world is so colorful and so beautifully done. All around a wonderful movie that is both fun and heartfelt."
Sweet new song by the prince and Ursula was perfectly cast. Same story with fun new scenes.
An enjoyable experience that breaths new life into an old favorite. I enjoyed it very much and look forward to purchasing it on DVD.
Absolutely loved the movie! One of my favorites!
Great movie. Special effects were wonderful. Loved it!
"had low expectations because of all the disappointing live action remakes lately, but was absolutely enchanted by this movie. wonderful performances by the vast majority of the cast, charming renditions of classic songs, just a beautiful, wonderful experience overall."
WE ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT BRAVO!
I loved this adaptation.  So happyy kid got to experience it in 3D.  I still felt as filled with emotions as I did in 1989 when I saw the original.  Thanks Disney!
"Movie was incredible, didn't expect it to be so right on with the original but I was shocked at how perfect it was. People can say what they want but at the end of the day this movie was very moving and it reminded me so much of the original yet still being its own twist."
Amazing!! Loved it!!
"It was a nice remake, plenty of surprises in the soundtrack. I liked it a lot. I was entertained."
I loveeeee it!!! Made me cry at the end.
Excellent film & perfect casting with all characters 10/10
"Loved the cinematic beauty, the allegory, and the actors but mostly Lin-Manuel’s new and fresh take on the music."
Halle Bailey is the perfect princess. The entire movie was captivating and a very fun time.
Nothing! Absolutely fantastic
Loved the movie! Go see it!
Perfect mermaid! It was a magical experience.
"I liked the movie because the graphics and the casting. 
I recommend this movie you have to see it."
Was an amazing adaptation of the original!!
It was very well done and all-inclusive. Great for the family.
"All races was represented and that’s the way of the world.  There’s no way around it it’s reality,"
Left out important scenes. Ruined my favorite childhood Disney movie 😭
I love the black mermaid. It was amazing and make me feel like a mermaid because I am blocked you. I felt very empowering because I love me some Black people especially the women.
"Told a beautiful story of people and beings with various  differences coming together for unity, peace and love."
"Gorgeous underwater sequences, beautiful singing, lousy story, wooden acting.  Kids will like it."
I came into this movie with low expectations as the original Little Mermaid has always been my favorite movie. This movie/version is a must see. I loved it so much that I will be coming again to watch it!
The culture aspects that was taught by the movie.  The acting and graphics were outstanding.
Everything was amazing! A must see
"Great rendition of the classic animated version. 
Characters were a perfect fit"
The magic from the original was not there. Ariel was cute and the actress was great but the rest????
"This was a great movie! Ms. Halle' brought me to tears. She has a beautiful voice. 😍 
Representation Matters!"
Best movie of 2023 let’s see if spider man will beat it!
I liked that it stayed trie to the original.
Amazing special effects and amazing performances for Halle Bailey and Malissa McCarthy
Old School Disney fantasy!  See it!  Great visuals and back story.
Another outstanding Disney movie!!!
Outstanding performance by all. My son and I enjoyed it.
Amazing singing and imagery. Stands well on its own without losing the tone of the original animated movie.
Loved the 3D version
"Incredible, my kids loved it and I feel like it tied up everything in the original that didnt make sense. So good"
Amazing love the new version mixed with the old!
I absolutely loved sharing my favorite movie with my children. I loved the representation of different cultures and races through the entire movie.
The movie was fantastic! First time at IMAX
I like everything bout the movie my daughters really enjoyed it
"The music was awesome, Ariel is a good actor."
The whole family loved it!!
We liked the movie but not the theatre it was so hot in there couldnt even watch the movie comfortably. It was so hot my kids were sweating and the back of my head was sweating on the recliner! AMC Palace 9 sucked!
It had all the fun and charm of the original and a few extras
The movie was awesome myself and my daughter enjoyed every minute of it
"It was my favorite as a kid and as an adult, it is still my favorite. It was beautiful!"
"This movie is great for all ages. My toll der loved it, I loved it, my mother in law loved it. The scenery was beautiful! Halle was AMAZING! I enjoyed the new songs and was happy to hear the original ones as well. All of the new and old included in the movie mixed together perfectly."
"Loved the music and cinematography. Sad that the song about Sebastian about to be cooked was deleted, but I understand why. Loved the animation.  The violent scenes were pretty rough for the little kids in the theater."
Loved it! Very few changes for the eh original but overall a good movie.
Everything about the movie was so good. It was so many mermaids. Having a black mermaid plus it was three other mermaids that were black too. It was beautiful. Oh my God I love this movie so much me and my daughter enjoyed it so much. Just hate they did not have any little mermaid dolls to buy at the theater.
I love it. Halle Bailey was phenomenal and a great singer. Prince Eric and the rest of the cast did amazing too!
"We loved it!  I saw the original in theaters and just had to see this one on opening weekend.  I definitely felt the magic all over again and was not disappointed.  Watching the excitement of the audience around me was great.  I heard clapping twice, after “Part of your World” and at the end.  I would recommend."
"Loved the animation, the songs and diversity of cast.  Stayed true to the original story, yet had musical updates that were fitting for 2023."
This movie is absolutely amazing! Halle really did her thing. Love to see the black girl magic!!!
"Great movie with a positive message and entertaining for all. 
Music and visuals were well done."
Full of color and wonderful music. The cinematography amazing. Clearly a must see in theaters.
"Before seeing the movie, my wife and I read a lot of bad reviews about Disney following an agenda with this movie. We both thought this was a really cute movie and not once did we think any ideas were being imposed on us. Loved that this movie was inclusive and representative of a lot of different people."
Cast was great! Halles voice sounded so good and she embodied the character so well. Gave me the nostalgia I wanted but had enough of a fresh take on the story to not feel like a lesser copy of the original. Visually beautiful as well.
"The animation really ruined the ""live action""."
"This movie brought back memories of watching the original. It was just like the original except for live action, cgi and different people playing the characters. It was a joy to see such a diverse cast with excellent acting and singing. Sebastian was funny as always. Halle Bailey shines as Ariel. It was an excellent casting. The bird was entertaining as well."
Pretty decent. Funny nd our daughter loved it
The whole movie was great!
"It was excellent!! The acting, cinematography, costumes all were excellent!! I especially loved the diversity of the cast!"
A well done live action remake. Hallie's voice is beautiful as Ariel.
Good movie I love thanks
Halle Bailey was brilliant as Ariel! I laughed. I cried. I believed! What an amazing experience this movie was!
Disney got another one right! Lead actress was amazing!!
Dull with no charisma. Max and Grimsby were the only real highlights. Where was Les Poissons?
Loved this live action take on a classic fairytale never mind an iconic Disney movie.
I didn't like the change they made with Arial
It was a sweet movie. Well made with great singing and acting.
Very colorful and moving story. I really loved the different twists from the original. You will be glued to the screen and entertained from start to finish. The while family enjoyed it!
The movie remained faithful to the original animated version. Halley Bailey and the supporting cast were perfect. Love wins!
Halle did amazing. Her voice is majestic.
My 9 year old granddaughter and I loved it. All of the  cast and the special effects were amazing!  I am going to take my husband and see it again!
What a cool retelling of a classic!
"Halle Bailey did a great job as Ariel, and it was a beautiful rendition of the animated classic!"
FANTASTIC movie.  Loved it!  The special effects are incredible.
Wasn't the original Ariel I grew up on. What's not broke shouldn't be fixed. Great Visuals otherwise
"If I could give negative stars, I would"
Underwater scenes were beautiful. Halle Bailey has a beautiful voice. It was a little long. Dont like that the races didnt match those of the original fairy tale.
The whole movie was great! I loved the use of all races in the movie. With love shared equally with all.
I loved the original cartoon.  This was good but not quite as amazing
Halle Bailey killed it in this movie!!! Awesome
I loved that they kept the movie very close to the original.  Halles voice was EVERYTHING!
Amazing. Loved the diversity of the cast
"Love the cartoon original but the live action was so good!  Very well done.  Hallee Bailey was amazing, as well as Melissa McCarthy.  I will see it again and again."
It was a great movie
Loved loved loved it!
Watched twice already! Ursula was amazing 🤩
Loved it!! What a great movie!!!
"Movie was good, identical to the original minus 2 new songs. CGI could have been much cleaner"
Amazing spectacular effects
Loved the movie! Its close to the cartoon plus new songs! Really loved it!
"Amazing. I loved it!!
Ms. Bailey was wonderful! It was a must to see. The whole cast was magnificent!!"
Absolutely enjoyed it!  It was definitely worth all of the hype and the wait!
"Liked when Sebastian said you eeediiattt!
Liked when the skittle was singing hip hop with Sebastian.
Liked Sebastian under the sea."
I loved the diversity of the cast!!!! Very awesome retelling of a classic tale!!
Loved the diversity the beautiful colors and really enjoyed the new twists on the songs
"The movie is for all ages, young or old.  The kids really enjoyed the movie. It made you tear up at the end."
Why is the news bringing up culture wars and stuff?  Just seemed like a pretty good movie to me.  Good way to spend a couple hours on a day off.
Absolutely LOVED IT! Thank you Disney!
Ariel was mesmerizing! Beautifully redone!
"The length of the movie was a bit long for small kids there was collective antsyness around the 1hr mark in my theater. Overall the movie was diverse, the music and lyrics were clear and witty, and the animal characters (sebestain and flounder) were spot on. The main actress was phenomenal. The movie did a great job of being more up to date but also capturing the essence of the original film. More diversity in films is needed!"
"was amazing, my family saw it twice opening weekend! Halle Bailey is gorgeous and her voice gave me goosebumps.10/10 recommend"
It was amazing absolutely loved every minute of it. I was moved to tears multiple times.
Loved it . The whole story was spot on like the cartoon the acting was very good also
3D version was great!  Was happy they stayed pretty close to the original version with a few tweaks. Newly added songs were ok. Loved the casting!
"I never got my WOW moment. Flounder and Sebastian could have been better. The cast was actually not bad but overall I just didnt get that moment of wow. And the splash on the rock part, ya that was a big let down. Good attempt but I did not enjoy the movie like the original."
"It was a wonderful movie. Hallie Bailey acting was amazing.  Her acting debut was flawless. She was the most beautiful mermaid ever.

The diverse multi culture cast was endearing and warming to see. I was really intrigued by the reflection of the embodiment of society.  The inclusion of all. More importantly the kids get to see themselves in many roles. Hats off to Disney for this display of inclusion. We need more representation of all."
"Well, they might as well cancel the Oscars TheLittleMermaid2023 is gonna win dang near all of them! LMM ""might"" take home one for Scuttlebutt, and best score probably isn't in the cards, but pretty much everything else should go to TLM.

Even the sound editing is off the hook! Subtle little shifts in sound follow the action as if it were live. The voices and singing are phenomenal.

Cinematography is amazing. GCI and humans are interchangeable the images are so good!

And, the story has a very fine moral woven into the wonderful songs and images!

Swim as fast as your merperson flippers will take you to see TLM in a full immersion setting like RCXtreme or IMAX!"
Absolutely loved it My daughter and I enjoyed it
Movie was amazing from beginning to end.  Great cast.
Saw it with my 6 year old daughter and we loved it. It was such a refreshing movie. The cast were all great!
Could’ve been better. The ending was the best part. That’s when the action started and really was put out there.
"Great music, CGI and special effects."
Fantastic musicals — lots of color and action  beautiful scenery well done !!
"Incredibly well done...exciting to watch! Sorry that the French chef and kitchen scene with Sebastian was cut out, though."
Such a good time! Halle CAN SING 🥹🥹
Love love loved it!!! What more can I say!!!
"So good! Some scenes were different, there were only two that I minded. They were at the end. But overall, excellent movie!"
Halle was really great she has a perfect voice. Melissa Mccarthy was amazing as Ursula she blew the movie away. But some of the movie just didn't feel like little mermaid. With some casting choices we're awful with some. Didn't care for scuttle at all. I would put 100% but scuttle didn't really do it justice
I cant say enough about how great this film was. My 3 year old loved it and found only like one part scary. Perfect way to spend the day with her and her 12 year old cousin.
"I loved the movie! I wish it included one of my favorite scenes from the original, but overall the movie was spectacular"
it was amazing with the same best characters and songs.
My son and I love movie
"Totally enjoyable!  If you like the cartoon, you'll love this as well!!"
"Such a great movie!! The singing was wonderful, just like the first one and Sebastian was hilarious! Just like I remember him. Way to go Disney!"
Loved the movie! Ursula was a bit too scary
An updated & entertaining version of the original. I loved it
This is a must see movie.. beautiful
Looooved it! Stayed true to the original with only a few minor changes. I cried like a baby at the end.
Loved the movie and the actors. It didnt sway at all from the original which was good. Melissa McCarty was great!
Great acting and singing
Loved everything about this movie!
Part of your world was so moving!!! Halle was amazing and stunning as usual. Couldn't imagine anyone else playing that role.
Amazing! I loved it! Would watch it again!!
It was a beautiful take on the original. My children loved the graphics and Scuttle and Sebastian stole the show.
Perfect adaptation!!! Halle was magnificent!
"It was amazing!! Watched it in 3D. The actors, producers, directors and everyone with a part in the production did an outstanding job!!"
"It was wonderful, very true to the cartoon, with modern updates. Seeing it in 3-D was wonderful, and both of my children under six loved it."
"Excellent movie, I really enjoyed the entire movie."
So beautiful! I loved it. I would say maybe better for teens or adults.
awesome movie for children and adults!!
"I really enjoyed this remake. Ursula was great, Ariel was a good cast. I was kinda disappointed in Sebastian... didn't seem as lively as in the cartoon movie.  Spoiler alert  I'm not sure how I feel about the ending being tweaked a little bit... it's cool they made Ariel the hero, but she saved Eric's life in the beginning, not sure why they  changed that ending part so she saved him again. Like I said I'm not sure how I feel about it... not a bad change but not sure why they had to do it. 
Otherwise it was a good remake of the movie, my daughter, her friend and I enjoyed it."
Great movie. I put a point off because Daveed Diggs played Sebastian. It would have been better if an authentic Jamaican style actor played Sebastian. Why him?
Halley Bailey did a great job as Ariel. The added songs by Erik didnt seem to fit. Missed Sebastians songs but liked how they tried to make it more realistic. Great movie overall!
Awesome remake of a beautiful classic . Ive loved the little mermaid since I was a little girl and seeing her come alive was wonderful perfect they kept all of the critical elements of the movie and added important. Cultural components to send a strong message of hope. May we embrace the lesson a little of the importance of celebrating our differences. Its the only way were going to survive and thrive.
loved it and the music
This movie was so adorable! I loved it. I wish there was a victory dress but nevertheless it was great and I had a great time watching this!
Halle Bailey is fine. The end of my review
AWESOMENESS AWESOMENESS AWESOMENESS All RACES unified like AMERICA is supposed to be!!!
All in all very good. A few scenes where half in and half out of the water looked a little weird. But we all enjoyed it very much. Ariel did an great job.
Loved this movie 🧜🏿‍♀️
The beautiful scenery and big screen
Worst movie ever from Disney. The costumes and special effects are a shame. What was the budget for this movie? I can’t mention all the details I’m disappointing about. Reading all the reviews are not even enough. You have to see it for your self. It’s terrible
"I liked the main actors very much but felt that the orchestral music, although fabulous, somewhat overshadowed/overpowered the exquisite vocals.  The balance could have been better.  I also thought the storylines darker themes were carried out a bit longer and more violent than necessary."
The cast was wonderful and their voices were fabulous!  Our daughter loved it and she is 4 years old and sat through the movie completely interested through it all!
Absolutely loved it! Great music
This is a great remake of a Disney classic. The new Ariel is fabulous and the music cant be beat! Definitely a must see. I will say that it may be a tad long for the little ones but otherwise its great.
Much better than expected.  I'm not a fan of all the Disney remakes.  However this movie is definitely worth seeing and stands on it's own merit.
Watched this with my 19 year old. I used to sing the Ariel song to her when she was a baby.  The movie is beautiful and the nostalgia was so strong we both cried even in the parts you’re not meant to cry in. Loved all the new scenes and new songs too. We both loved it so much!
Excellent! Loved everything about it! From the cast to the singing to the movie itself!
"Wasn’t for her singing or Melissa stealing the show as Ursula, it would’ve been boring. It had its moments, but drew me away several times."
"This is definitely the best of the live action remakes. I could be biased though, because TLM 89 is my favorite Disney movie. But it really was wonderfully done in my opinion, and the casting for Ariel, Eric and Ursula was perfect. However, just like all the remakes, even though it was great, it still was just unnecessary. I can get just as much or more out of watching the original even though there were some delightful new things in the live action."
Love how true it stayed to the Disney but also still had its own flair. Fantastic acting from an incredible cast! Love the actress who plays Ariel!
Loved it. Saw it twice.
"I thought it was an amazing adaptation. the music was incredible, the scenery below the water and on land was very magical and took me back to my childhood. I'll definitely watch it again and again! Halle Bailey was the perfect choice for Ariel!"
Riveting & bright!!  Exciting & fun!!  Every age group and every human was having a blast!!
Liked the whole movie
The movie was just like the original. The images were so vivid and beautiful. I love how there were so many different races represented.
"This is the second time we have purchased assigned seating form this movie theater and have found other people in our seats, having to sit at the front row."
I saw it twice in one weekend! It was absolutely beautiful
"Singing was amazing, and I loved the Cast!!"
"It was such a good movie, we all enjoyed it very much. The characters were awesome."
"Too long. Didnt like the way the characters of Sebastian, Scuttle and Flounder were reimagined, not as likeable. Halle Bailey and Melissa McCarthy did a good job. Tried too hard to be inclusive and ethically diverse. Cant  we be true to a Danish fairy tale. So much for cultural literacy."
"It was a little too long but was good. Movie theater we went to, AMC 5th St Wyomissing, PA is filthy. They need to close this location or make changes. I wont ever go back"
"It is a good remake, but not fantastic. A bit boring at times, but worth watching once. The sea gull and Ariel herself are amazing. I liked the original sea witch and Sebastian way better. They have completely deleted Sebastian’s kitchen scene. The music is fun."
"Eric was using too much of his acting, but Ursula used JUST ENOUGH!!! Sea Witch for President!"
Beautiful adaptation. A star is born!
It’s giving all the nostalgia with a dash of extra seasoning. Love!
"I loved the changes to the story, the main actress was phenomenal, I loved the ending."
Movie was phenomenal
The move was engaging and family friendly.
"The movie was delightful, but the theater was dirty, noisy and, of course, the concession is a huge ripoff."
It was ok. Music was good! Wish it was more authentic to the original
Refreshing good movie for the whole  family
"This movie is art. It teaches people everywhere about love and their value of their voices. Its beautifully done, and Im planning on seeing it again this week. Its a must see."
The movie its really great and has a good picture
No plot  kinda boring
A wonderful nod to the original with its own new and exciting take!
AMAZING!! 10/10 Loved the new songs and Halle and the rest of the cast were great!
"If you love the original animated movie, you will live this one, especially in 3D."
It was a great movie! Its almost better than the original!
"It was not bad at all, but the slow parts where a bit rocky but that’s a live action compared to a cartoon. Not bad though"
"It was alright, nothing to rave over"
The movie was amazing! The casting was perfect.
Amazing. Even for a bit teary eyed at the end.
Great movie for a younger audience.
I thought that it was a wonderful movie
LOVED everything about it!
I truly loved it the singing of course the acting from all the actors plus the costumes as well the storylines  from all sides even Ursula
Timeless story with a great cast!  The cinematography was phenomenal.  we watched it in 3D.
Bored. Talk sing.    Not like
"Much watch movie  Brilliant cast and music selections
Halle Bailey voice is beautiful"
Loved the production from start to finish.
The movie was an absolute masterpiece! My daughter and I had an amazing time seeing Ariel come to life in a brand new way on the big screen!
Very good movie very diverse
Wonderful graphics. Great music. Fun story a little different from the animated version. Enjoyable for adults.
We loved this movie!! The acting and singing was Incredible!! Halle Bailey did a Wonderful job playing Ariel!!!
"Was an amazing movie. Magical, spectacular, stunning, THE BEST LIVE ACTION!!"
"Great special effects

Great story line

Super singing."
It was an amazing call back to all the feelings we had as a child.
It was great.  Loved it
Visual effects were amazing!  Loved an updated and better take from the original cartoon.
Wonderful retelling of a classic! The visuals and vocals are beautiful!!! We had a great time!!
Halle Bailey was incredible as Ariel. I am a fan of the animated film since childhood and I really enjoyed this interpretation. My biggest complaint is that Chef Louis was not reimagined in this live action version. I like the additional development of Eric's character. I think the film was perfectly cast - everyone was amazing!!
This was beautiful. Halle’s voice was captivating
So awesome. I am 34 years old and I always love little mermaid. It just made my little childhood come to life.
My 8 yr old really enjoyed this movie in 3D
Really well done with a few added touches to make the story even better.
"This was a great movie, especially for fans of the original animated picture. It stayed pretty close to the storyline, while still bringing in a few more creative and updated touches. It was an all-star cast and Haileys performance was phenomenal!"
"I honestly had low expectations from this movie, but I loved it. It kept my attention from start to finish. Melissa stole the show in this movie I really wanted to see more of her."
I liked the realness and the way the emotions were depicted!!
"Loved it so much! Sobbing at the end. Halle Bailey is an incredible young talent, and Melissa McCarthy was perfectly evil."
this version stands on its own! 10 out of 10 recommend
Very good. We thoroughly enjoyed!
I like it because it was full of action.
Loved it!! Disney again breaking barriers. Keep up the fight!!
"Such a diverse sweet love story, Halle Bailey is the one to look out for !"
My daughter and I loved it!
That was great movie!
Absolutely loved the movie!!!
Loved the movie but it was a little long.
The music was excellent! Her voice is amazing! I would watch this move 100x! Well done!  I like the added back story..  it helps to fill in the gaps. Hoping they make a movie on Ursula.
Best Live Action Ever!!! The Cast was perfect! And the story about Eric was a Plus
What a great movie. Loved the new songs (and of course the old ones too). The casting was spot on!!  This is a must see
This was an enjoyable movie and the live version was just as fun as the animated.
The Little Mermaid was amazing and beautiful
Generally not good. Disappointing for Disney
Great story line with a few changes to the original. Wasnt a fan of the additional music.
"First of all, Halle is awesome! Next, I really like how they stuck to the Caribbean theme. It made sense with the marine life and Sebastian's accent. It also made me feel warm, watching something that reminds me of my West Indian culture."
daughter and wife loved it
It was a fabulous remake of the original.
Beautiful movie! Halle has a beautiful voice. Awesome job!
"Likes: Followed source material, Musical Numbers, Ursula’s Glow. Dislikes: Prince Fratboy, Lobster Gate!"
Great movie definitely going to see it again
it was amazing she was perfect for the role
"Absolutely stunning! The Little Mermaid has been my favorite Disney movie since I was tiny, and Halle is a wonderful Ariel. The casting was pretty spot on, and the visuals are STUNNING! I wasnt a huge fan of Scuttles song, but I enjoyed the other new additions. I cried because it made me feel like a kid again."
Fantastic movie! Loved the ending!
"Content from the original was great, very well done. Didnt like any of the new songs."
"We loved the signing, colorful, etc.  There was a bit of a lull but over-all whole family enjoyed it."
It was visually beautiful
So Amazing!!! Laughed & Cried. They did amazing!! Everyone & Everything was amazing.
I liked it better than the cartoon version
Loved the actors and the design. Hate the storyline as a whole. The movie was longer than it needed to be. Fell asleep 3 times.
"Really enjoyed this movie! New additions to a classic! A must see. Can be scary for a little kids, so I would recommend it for ages five and up."
I liked the music and the story. But they didn’t need to kill King Triton towards the end.
Visually magnificent! Halle Bailey's voice is like hot cocoa with marshmallow on a snowy night. All the songs were beautiful including the new ones. Can't the tune of Under the sea out of my head :)
Loved the movie   just as good as the Disney movie in 93  it was mine and my daughters favorite movie . Shes now 32
Beautifully remade frome the casting to the additional songs and added lyrics. The kids and adults in the theater were singing and dancing along.
"This film was amazing, I give it a 10!!!"
I want my money back I hade a horrible experience their were kids crying and I couldn’t hear the movie
Halle Bailey did an awesome job. Halles's singing was excellent. Melissa Mccarthy was excellent.  the whole movie was just great.
If I didn’t know the original storyline it would have been better. I’m all for remakes but this one was a bit jolting although entertaining.
Super cute movie. Better than I expected.
True enough to the cartoon but with a modern and updated vibe!!
I like everything about the movie
"I really liked that a lot of brand new scenes and songs were included along with the original story elements of the first.  It made the ""love story"" more believable because there was actual chemistry that built instead of just enchantment."
"The movie was really good, I missed the chef song, but my 10-year-old daughter really liked it. For people that are complaining it's a movie based on a cartoon from some 30+ years ago of course it's different, but who cares it was a good adventure for the kids..."
The movie was good and very entertaining
"It was colorful, fun, and heartwarming. Halle was an inspiration along with the rest of the cast!!"
Loved loved loved this movie. Halle is fantastic. Makes me feel happy. Very moving!!!!!
I loved the characters and the singing.  Disney did a masterful job with this version of the Little Mermaid!!!
Beautifully done movie.
Love the 3d animation.
The cast was amazing. The singing and the acting were great.
Was great me and my daughter enjoyed it
"A little longer than it needs to be, but it was really really good."
It was the classic movie with a new spin on the characters.
Incredible from beginning to end!
A really great remake.  The movie and characters do not dissapoint.
So awesome and different than the animated film.
"The real life people in the movie, not cartoon like the previous Little Mermaid movie. The the special effects were what made this a fantastic movie!"
Loved it! Could have done better with Ursula’s CGI in the end.
"Better than I was expecting. Halle and Melissa did a Fabulous job, excellent!"
Melissa McCartney made a great Ursula
Very good movie. Cast and everything was great.
"I feel like Ursula had lack of expressions, also I think the movie needed to be more magical but overall the movie was good"
Horrible attempt at a remake should have never attempted to remake it!!
"Don't listen to the haters (you know what they're about). This is a fine movie. Halle Bailey is JUST ADORABLE and she sings very well.  Don't miss out on a good experience, go enjoy this movie."
So much more spectacular than I ever expected! I have to see it again!
The music and graphics were awesome
We liked that it followed the story line well. Ariel and Ursulas voices were great. Eric's song was blah. Skuttles song was a fun new addition. We loved it and would see it again!
"I liked everything-- the actors , the graphics and cinematography, the musical score
Although I loved the original animated movie too. But they did excellent job with update
and actually improved story with all the inclusiveness"
Absolutely loved it!  A Disney must-see!
"Great 3D movie that thrilled myself,my friend and my 9 year old granddaughter!
Music was amazing and 3D cinematography was out of this world!"
Loved every second of it
"Saw it 3D. Really enjoyed the songs, storyline and nostalgia."
I LOVED Ursula. Melissa did Pat Carroll proud.  I wish the purple glitter gown was used in the end.
Amazing cast. Halle’s voice is beautiful. Great new songs written by Lin Manuel
"Was just not like the original. Couldve picked a better lead for Ariel and flounder, Sebastian and scuttle were even more disappointing the Ariel. Disney couldve done way better. Another original movie ruined by the live make."
It was true to the original.  Hailey has a beautiful voice. And I love the diverse cast.  Wonderful job.
Loved the fresh story telling. Not too far from the original and what was added truly did add to the story.
Loved the music!!!! the movie was sooo well done.
"I loved this movie! I cried, I laughed, and I got scared.  I definitely recommend this movie!"
beautiful made as always disney did their thing
"I love everything about this movie. I took my 24 year old daughter to see it because it was her favorite as a little girl. She cried then and she cried now. 
The music was amazing and all of the characters did a great job"
"Beautifully done!  Both funny, emotional, & entertaining for children and adults!  Highly recommend!"
"Halle Bailey and Melissa McCarthy did a great job, and the music was awesome! Could have done without the scuttlebut song though."
Hallie Baileys voice was simply amazing!
Melissa McCathy as Ursula was AWESOME!!!
Best live action movie Disney has made to-date.
Awesome in 3D and 4DX
It was a little bit too long
Me my kids and grandkids love the movie will watch it again
Beautiful movie and an awesome message. I love how they expand on who Prince Eric is and their relationship. Halle Bailey is a perfect Ariel! JavierYES! Cried at the end.
We loved it! I loved the representation and inclusivity. I could see myself in the faces of the actors! way to go Disney!
"Hallie Bailey and cast gave a stellar performance!!! Loved the VIVID COLORS, costuming, music(Scuttle/Sebastian rap), settings, story line with GREAT MESSAGE!!! Just BEAUTIFUL!!!"
It was a boring movie
Love love love it! I laughed I cried and I am in line to see it again now.
The movie was fantastic. It  was inclusive for everyone. It was great for my grandchildren to see people who looked like them.
The essence of the little mermaid is heightened. The mystery surrounding what happened 15 years ago to Ariel’s mom and Eric’s parents has me yearning for a sequel!!!
It was cute and followed the traditional story. The clever Disney connection of worlds was well done.
Enjoyed it immensely. Recommend to see at least once.
Fun and cinematic. So glad I listened to the negative reviews and saw for myself.
Took my 9 year old grandchild to see it---was wonderful. They added a couple of new songs but thought they were very inventive with the original songs too. Ursula may be a little too scary for really young kids.
"I loved the actors, the storyline, the music, and it was long enough!"
"Such a cute and immersive live action version of the animated movie I grew up with. Halle Bailey and Jonah Hauer-King have awesome chemistry. And Halle did an amazing job carrying the film as a lead. And her voice! My goodness…had me in tears during Part of Your World. I really enjoyed this movie and they did a great job balancing what I grew up on with some modern tweaks for today. I was absolutely charmed by this movie. The CGI was lacking in some areas but the cast did well enough that it didn’t take me out of the experience. All around, I give it a thumbs up!"
"I loved this movie!! Will go see it again. Again, and again!!!"
Beautiful live action version of original...updated with  some new songs but still has classics!  Cast was wonderful...a nice version of the story that does not diminish the animated version!
It was fantastic. I loved every minute of it.  Totally awesome!!!!!
Movie was too long and too many little details were changed from the original version.
"I actually liked this movie more than I thought I would.  Typical Disney - over the top, enchanting and visually entertaining, including all the iconic songs from the original."
It was amazing seeing scenes from the animated version in real life form. Halle was absolutely perfect cast for Ariel! Her grace was felt through the screen!
"Beautiful, diverse cast and characters, incredible visual production, soundtrack stunning"
I thought the movie was pretty good and her voice always gives me the chills.  Excellent version of the movie.
Nice Touch on this Disney Classic!
The movie was amazing. I cried at the end.
Happy they stayed to the storyline. Halles voice is so angelic . Loved it!
The Little Mermaid movie was awesome!  I went through a range of emotions and was very entertained from the beginning to the end.  It’s a definite must-see.
1000/10 It was emotional yet wonderful!
I was surprised by how delightful and enjoyable this fun sweet movie was!!
I liked it overall. Halle Bailey and Melissa McCarthy killed it!
"The movie was good, just like the original."
Lovely production very close to the original
"LOVED this movie!  When my daughter was little, she watched the animated movie over and over.  Loved seeing this with her and remembering all we loved about the movie.  Great effects!  I wouldnt recommend the movie for any child under 6 because of some of the intense parts."
Halle Bailey gives a soul-filling performance throughout the entire film that one can't deny is just simply stunning. Melissa McCarthy didn't disappoint with her version of Ursula. Such a fun movie - see it in a theater!
Loved the movie except for the part with Prince Eric singing: that was a bit much. Everything else was fantastic from the stunning under sea visual effects to the beautiful diverse cast. It's also funny that the people who claim to hate this movie (and we all know why) were still in the theaters.
100% loved it !!! Love that there was very little change from the original !!
Great for the whole family!  We loved everything about it.  Disney got it right again
The under sea look was cool bright colors  I do wish her friends look more like the cartoon also miss the cook Halle nail the part great fun
The movie was amazing. We loved that it followed the original storyline.
"Mostly stuck to the original storyline. We loved it. 
The overall colors in the movie could have been more vibrant."
Visually stunning and beautiful music!! This remake is absolutely refreshing
"Halle Bailey was amazing , I cried at the end !"
They did such a great job on this movie!! Love Hailey as Ariel !!
I thought they did a great job bringing the little mermaid to life. Only thing I didnt love was prince Erics extra song but otherwise a great live action film and my kids loved it.
"The best live action adaptation of a Disney movie ever!!! I love every second of, besides the scuttlebutt song."
The cast was AMAZING! So well done.
Loved it! Loved the music!
"Beautiful!!!! The vocals were amazing, the visuals were impressive and overall lovely storyline."
Great artistry and music…..way too long!
Better than expected. Underwater scenes look great in 3D.
"We like the entire movie and Ariel was very important to my daughters Thanks.,"
The cast being so mixed racially. I loved the lead character.
It was absolutely phenomenal and Halle was PERFECT for this role.
"Cast was amazing, music was incredible!!"
"Loved, loved, loved it!   Halle was born to play Ariel!!! My family truly enjoyed the movie"
"I loved the changes they made to the storyline, so the small changes they made to storyline helped the overall story. The music was great, I even liked the scuttlebutt song. The only think I did not like was the animation, but overall it was great.  I loved the little mermaid movie when I was younger and Chloe’s (little mermaid) gave me chills for part of your world like she. I was younger."
I thought it was a really great adaptation of the original. It was only missing one favorite line! lol
Great modern day twist to a classic
"Beautifully done! The stars, music and cinematography were so fantastic! I loved it!"
The main character stole my heart with her singing and expressive beauty. The chemistry between the two lead actors was enchanting. The cinematography was beautiful.
"Far from beating the original but still enjoyable to watch with family.  I didn't really feel the Ariel and Eric connection.  They tried to build it up but ended up flat. McCarthy had a great voice for Ursala but I think her face was too recognizable and not evil looking. I think she could've used more evil make up or something.  Triton was great sounding and looking.  Otherwise, beautiful underwater entertainment during ""Under the Sea"" song."
"I was waiting for my favorite scene was the meal part where she used the fork- dingle hopper,  on her hair but it was changed, so I was disappointed. But overall, I enjoyed it and teared up in the end"
It was slow at times.
Everything was top tier
I never seen original cartoon so I went in with no bias a open mind. I loved the movie. My daughter loved it too. The audience interviewed theater with me seemed to enjoy it also. Great Disney movie.
Lots of nostalgia for us original Little Mermaid Fans. We enjoyed the live action version.
"I loved this movie, I never wanted it to end!!"
It was beautiful!  The colors the actors  EVERYTHING!
"I liked everything, mostly the songs 
And just seeing my granddaughter enjoying the movie. Made my day"
Loved it - done with so much love and care.
I really enjoyed the movie! Well done!
"Fantastic.  Halle Bailey is perfect in the lead role in fact, there wasn't a mistake in the entire cast.  All the songs (including the new songs) are great."
It was very cute. It followed the original story with a couple of new additions. We enjoyed it.
This movie was EXCELLENT from beginning to end.
excellent movie and songs
Excellent movie! Halle was outstanding Academy award performance
Hallie voice was amazing
"The movie was beautiful but I expected more, 90 % of the movie was the same as the first Disney movie , every time I knew what was going to happen and also the text was the same. The actors where beautiful and the movie was oke , not spectacular. My children where thinking the same. We all adore the first Disney movie though"
It was too long. Not good for small children
This film did the animated film justice. Pleasantly surprised
Great movie!!! Definitely recommend seeing it!
Great movie! Acting and visuals were amazing.
It was amazing. Loved how they fixed the original plothole and made the love story make more sense. It was incredible. Best Disney remake I've seen so far.
Loved the entire movie!  The modernized redo was phenomenal.
The movie theatre is small which is actually a good thing. Anywhere you sit you get a great view of the movie. The movie was awesome. Compared to the original its highly rated. This gets
Loved it!! Beautiful visually and musically. Great cast!!
I loved the new songs. Triton dissolving was a bit rough but otherwise it was a beautiful movie.
I loved it from the beginning to the end. Hailey did a wonderful job. A must see for all ages.
"Great choice for actors, story line matched the animated movie but with a few extra/different things that made the movie fresh."
My daughter loved the real live characters with all the special effects that made the movie awesome !!!
I loved the beautiful seenery and the story!
This was an amazing and well produced movie!
I loved the beautiful colors and how real everything was. I was mesmerized the whole movie and Im 34 years old. Well done
Not for young children.  Violence and scary scenes.  It is a movie better suited for adults.  I would not take my young child to see it.  Special effects were outstanding.
I was skeptical about a live action but this movie is truly great. I love the cartoon but there is something special about this one.
"many changes in the story, I'm talking about the story of the movie NOT THE CHARACTERS"
"The movie is colorful,  excellent music and the animation is incredible.  It's based on the Caribbean sea so she is the perfect Ariel.  At one point the movie gets slow but it's based on the original from almost 40 years ago, for me there was not difference.  I highly recommend to see it in a Max screen so you can enjoy the underwater animation better."
"Disney Magic, loved it!"
"The music, the actors and the special effects were all excellent"
"Movie wasnt bad, I just dont think there was much in the area of 3D effects to make that an option for this film."
Really love the movie!!
It was heartwarming to see this movie again as an adult. Halle was a perfect pick.
Best of the live action remakes so far.
"did not tarnish the original animated version. good, clean vocals 👍🏼👍🏼"
"Saw it in 3D. A couple of us fell asleep during the middle. Don't know why Eric had a song to sing. The beginning and ending were good. Ursula stole the show.  Wouldn't pay to see it again, should have waited for the free streamiing."
"Was one of the best movies we saw in a long time.
We laughed, cried, danced and sang..  We even got a few goosebumps. Recommend seeing!!!!"
Horrible changes in music. Prince Eric looks 45 and Ariel’s a teenager. It’s creepy! Way too long of a movie! Don’t waste your money like I did.
"Good acting, great songs, a little rap in there. Kept the girls interested"
"I love the animation and the leading actress. She was beautiful. I could have done without prince Erics song but, overall it was a good film. I enjoyed it."
They've considerably improved the depth and relatableness of the characters compared to the original. Very impressed! Wonderful fairytale.
"It was perfect!  The music, the effects, the added back story on Prince Eric.  Everyone was amazing.  Melissa McCarthy was perfect as Ursula"
"Great adaptation, TLM is my favorite Disney movie and they did it justice with this one. Definitely recommend"
"Its an amazing movie, love , love, love  ."
"I LOVED the spin on some of the original songs, and it was amazing in 3D. Halle and Melissa stole the show and I even cried at the end. I felt like the little girl who loved the animated film in the 90s, and I’m going to see it again."
This movie went beyond my expectations Thank you Disney for giving us something to cherish for years to come
This movie was Everything! My daughter was super Excited and Engaged the entire movie. I Loved and Enjoyed everything about this movie. Excellent job Disney!!!
GREAT MOVIE !!! SAW IT THURSDAY on the 25th it was sooo amazing!! I will be watching it again. Congratulations to Halle Bailey and the entire cast !! The movie can be rewatched several times! GIVE HALLE HER EGOT !!!!!!!!!!
This is a must must see movies. Phenomenal work 👏🏾 from the beginning to the end. It's definitely a 5 star 🎬 and rated 10/10
It was a good spin on the original. The actors were phenomenal. The African American mermaid's name was a little harsh. A few of the close up views needed touch ups. The movie was moving and just so cute. A real feel good with all the bad stuff going on in the world.
The cast was good and everything was displayed correctly.
The movie was true to script and reflects modern realities of family and beauty and love.
"The movie was visually appealing, and I found Halle Bailey to be a very good Ariel. That being said, while it was decent overall, it fails to capture the magic of the original. The new music was not very good, and one song in particular (The Scuttlebutt) was just awful and out of place in the movie."
Liked the story line and the music.
"Little Mermaid was fantastic! I recommend seeing it in 3D if possible, its stunning! I felt like I was under water! Im always skeptical about a remake of a classic but they did the original Justice!"
The movie was great just very short but I will see it again
Wow is all that I can say
Loved the live adaptation! Watched it with my 6 year old and she loved it as well!
"10/10! probably the best disney live action remake that mirrors the original ANIMATED version..and doing so in the live action. Halle Bailey was excellent and the perfect person to play ariel, the entire cast for for each role. Its a must see for any and all ages!! I definitely will be seeing it again!"
"Ariel sidekicks should have had a deeper color, they looked bland. More mermaids should have been shown, that community looked empty."
I thought the cinematography was excellent. Actors were very good. Only thing I disliked is that it dragged in the middle - could have cut some of that out and then it would hold younger ones attention better.
I absolutely loved this film! I loved that nostalgia with a new twist! I loved sharing this with my children! Absolute must see if you are a Little Mermaid fan!
"This was a a great live action Disney movie. Ariel and Eric have chemistry. I love Scuttle! 
The Chefs song is the biggest disappointment. I loved that part in the animated version and to not have it at all was just sad. Ursula wasnt as good as the animated version either and Flounder is creepy. 
Halle Bailey gives a wonderful performance."
I thought the acting and visual effects were brilliant!
I loved everything about this movie.
"the movie was awesome. I thought Chole's performance was top tier. I felt like a kid again, while watching with my kid. I sang a long, my child sang a long. it was an awesome afternoon!"
It was excellent! Halle Bailey is a star! Melissa McCarthy was exceptional as Ursula. And Daveed Diggs was smashing as Sbastien! Take the whole family!
"This movie was everything I imagined it to be. Very whimsical and exciting. The visuals had me in awe, and I was even more stunned by the storyline since this is my first time seeing The Little Mermaid ever. Of course, I now have to go watch the original  love love loved it !"
"I loved all the characters. Everyone played there parts well. The pelican, crab,& fish was my favorite of all in the show. They kept us laughing during the whole movie."
Its was an amazing movie my babies and I loved it
This was the best live depiction Ive seen of a Disney movie. My 3 year old absolutely loved the movie.
I loved seeing Halle as Ariel..stunning show stunning performance..highly recommend. 10/10 across the boards for the entire cast as well as Rob Marshall and the soundtrack too…10/10/0!
"Honestly, I dont get what all the irritation over the movie was. It was well done, the minor line change to Kiss the Girl was hardly noticeable, and the additional storyline and characters made it great. It was made as a live action but had its own additions which made it that much more enjoyable. If it comes down to the color of any of the characters, then you lack the humanity to enjoy most things Id imagine. Melissa McCarthy as Ursula was amazing. Some of the CGI parts couldve been a little smoother, and getting a clearer shot of inflated Ursula wouldve been nice. All in all though, pretty dang good."
Great movie but leave the little kids at home for this its longer and a live action most people with small children were leaving because the kids were not interested in the movie I miss Les poissons but the new music was good too!
Great singing performances!
"I was really not expecting to cry with this movie and it happened 3 times. The girl that does Ariel is so sweet, you’ll fall in love with her along with the prince. They built up the lagoon scene so well and the transitions into songs was so organic. It has some humor sprinkled here and there but just the necessary and very well written and executed. Every actor was so well casted and did a magnificent job. Didn’t give it 5 stars because of Under the sea but maybe I am biased because I was used to the Spanish version from the 90s which was perfect."
loved it with my whole entire heart i cried at the end but mainly because i had daddy issues unlike when i first saw the animated one when i was like six but overall i don’t know whether i wanna be or be with halle bailey but ok damn well eric could get into my world def recommend so many fine ppl casted love mellissa mccarthy she was funny and loved her in gilmore girls just overall 100/10 but let’s just say if daddy tritain was my dad i would wanna leave the sea but can’t blame her after looking at the fine hunk of an eric
"Watched the old version a hundred times, but this rendition was beautiful! As life like as it gets! Very inclusive of all races & blended cultures! Great to sing along to! Visuals were right on!!"
Great family movie. My two daughters loved the live action version of LM.
My granddaughters and I loved this movie! The vocals were amazing.  I  highly recommend it.
I liked the movie. But I am an original little mermaid fan. I dont like how the wedding wasnt on the boat. And how Eric sang a song.  But Id definitely watch it again.
"Beautiful movie, loved the actors, but it is unnecessarily long (especially for kids)."
Love it this movie did justice to the original 🥰🧜‍♀️
Best Disney live animated movie. Loved Ariel’s (Halle) voice and acting. Scuttlebut song by Aquafina is a jam. Phenomenal Graphics/live animation/everything!
They added a few songs that weren't bad. and they added a few extra scenes but they all played in well to the original story. But overall a great movie to see with you friends or family.
It was a lovely movie 10/10
I absolutely loved it!!
It was more than I expected. The entire theater erupted with applause when the movie was over. I’m grateful that my daughter got to witness this moment in history.
I can not put into words how I feel with this movie. It hit all of the right notes and more. Halle was amazing she is her and she was made for this role she put all of her soul into this movie. The music blew me away i looking forward to seeing it again and again and again.
Really enjoyed this movie. Halle is amazing!!
Best Disney live action yet!
Great movie and amazing job Halle Bailey!
Loved it! Ill be back to see it again!
"The music, the acting, it was so good!"
"Don’t believe the haters, a well made Disney classic!"
It was such a beautiful movie!
"AMAZING MOVIE, LOVE HALLE BAILEY"
It left out parts from the original that were my favorite.  Was a little disappointed.
Breathtakingly beautiful. I almost cried a few times from the nostalgia. The casting was perfect. Scuttle and Sebastian did not disappoint. Ariel was perfection. King Triton knocked it out of the park. Ursula was the most devious and amazing. they all were on point
"I absolutely loved it, I wanted to cry. It’s amazing seeing a mermaid that looks like me, loved this she did an awesome performance!"
Asombrosa! Halle Bailey es excelente 👏👏👏
"I loved it! While they stayed true to the animated movie, the additional scenes and songs are amazing!"
I loved everything!!!
Love all the vibrant colors and the music was great
"Halle Bailey took the character of Ariel and made it her own. No wonder she raised the bar so high, no other actress could even touch her. I love that that Disney made Erics kingdom more of a Caribbean type of  kingdom   Just so multi cultural. Excellent job Disney!!!"
This movie was incredible. The new songs were an amazing addition.
"Very good adaptation of the original. Fun movie. They cut out the seen where Sebastian fights with the chef. Akwafina as Skuttle was the best.
Only issue is that Halle didnt capture the bubbly spirit of Ariel. Unfortunately like many movies today, they turn the star into a depressed teenager. Her performance and singing were great."
It was fun for the whole family
Halle Bailey 💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖
Great music and special effects!
I loved it! So much like the original with great casting.
"I went to The Little Mermaid with my daughter ,  son in law and grandchildren. We all really enjoyed it."
Halle Bailey is amazing. She transcends the role of Ariel
A SEQUEL RIGHT NOW PLEASE!
Felt a little rushed at times but good!
"A great live action retelling of the source material with a more in-depth look at characters that was not done in the animated version! Nothing groundbreaking, but still a cute live action of The Little Mermaid worth watching!"
Ariel and ursula were perfect but the movie was just boring.
I feel like the movie wasn’t true to its characters especially Ariel and the one who played her was great but I feel it should stay true to the original movie 100%. Don’t change what doesn’t need  changing.
must see for all! loved it!!
Really enjoyed the remake. Definitely a movie to see with the whole family.
Love everything about it!
"My girls were extremely entertained. It was a good Disney live action remake - not better than Jungle Book, but cool."
Loved the movie !!!!
"It was brought to life 
Absolutely love it"
I ABSOLUTELY LOVED EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS MOVIE!!!! HALLE BAILEY IS A WONDER!!!!! I HAVE ALWAYS LOVED MELISSA MCCARTHY!!!! IT IS MY FAVORITE!!!
"I loved it, The film took me back to the good times of my childhood. 🥰"
My favorite live action Disney movie by far!!!
i had high hopes for this movie but it was definitely not that good
Loved it!!!  Cast & effects were wonderful. Haile Bailey was perfect & Melissa McCarthy phenomenal fir the part.
Well done remake! Enjoyed it despite the changes from the classic cartoon version. Overall would watch again!
Halle did amazing great movie
I loved all the musical scenes
I loved it all. I am a big fan of the original version and was afraid I would be disappointed in this one but it was awesome!!
Such a fun and enjoyable movie experience!  I saw the original in theaters when I was 11 and today I got to take my slightly older 17yr daughter and we both just absolutely loved it.
It was beautiful 🩷🧜🏼‍♀️
I love this movie!  I loved how they evolved the story to give Eric and Ariel more agency and added some lovely new songs.  I felt like I was seeing my childhood favorite movie and snorkeling!  Amazing!
This is the first of the Disney live-action remakes that we've liked. This movie was really good! It might also be the first of the remakes that we watch again when it makes it to streaming.
A bit long for little kids
Very well done. Every little girl Shoshone see this movie. AAAAAAAA+
I loved it!  I loved the beauty of the ocean. All the colors. I think it's the best Little Mermaid I've ever seen!  Enjoyed it all.
Absolutely loved the movie and was in tears with the vocal of Ariel. Brought me back to my childhood in all the most beautiful ways
100% RECOMMEND WATCHING!!! I like many others did not think it was going to be like the little mermaid we watched growing up. Well I am so happy it was not it did have the same events but completely different in the most beautiful way. I also usually dislike live action musicals but the whole time I was watching I couldnt help but sing along. Overall it exceeded my expectations and will definitely watch again!
Omg best movie ever!!!! Loved all the characters .
It developed the relationship between the prince and Ariel better than the original. I liked the special effects.
It was good. Different than the original(of course it was going to be) but they did a great job
Stunning! Halle was brilliant! Great live action film!!
The scenery was beautiful.  3D made it awesome to watch. Great movie!
Not for people in there 20s.
Such a fun movie with so many cute and funny lines. Also loved the music and new songs!
I loved Melissa McCarthy!
The graphics were amazing. I lined the little additions to the original story line
beautiful cinematography and music
Loved HALLE AND THE ENTIRE CAST!
"FANDANGO WILL TAKE YOUR MONEY IF YOU DID NOT MAKE IT TO YOUR MOVIE.

I NEVER MADE IT TO THE MOVIE AND DID NOT KNOW THERE IS NO REFUNDS ON FANDANGO..

NO REFUNDS IF MOVIE ALREADY STARTED.    REFUNDS ONLY IF CANCELLED BEFORE MOVIE STARTS.    
THIS REALLY SUCKS, I LOST 30 FOR NOT BEING THERE AT THE THEATERS"
The movie was excellent. Hailey was terrific 👏 👌 The singing was AWESOME!! And her co-star was wonderful. Great cinematographer.
"This movie is such a magical experience. I throughly enjoyed the newer elements of this film, including the songs, the extended love story, and the dynamic between certain characters. The PERSONAL best part of this film was Halle Bailey and Jonah Hauer Kings performance. Their chemistry carries this film and you cant take your eyes off them. Will definitely watch it again."
I loved it. 100% recommend.
"The cinematography was amazing!
The twists and turns of the movie were great!"
I loved everything the girl who played Ariel  played the part well as well as the others did.
10/10 want to take the kids again
Amazing she did Justice to the voice
"It’s was a ok live action remake wasn’t better than the original animated movie, cgi creatures, still look weird and the under water scenes. but I did enjoy Halle Bailey as Ariel and Melissa Mccarthy as Ursula"
The songs and music and actors
"It was so bad, my god."
Beautiful cinematography and effects. Great new songs. Menken and Miranda are an incredible writing team.
"Remake made sequence changes that did not make sense,  poor CGI.  This is a remake that should not been made."
The movie was amazing! I couldnt find my rewards number to get my points.
Great movie! Loved the updated surprises mixed with the classic movie
Improves on the original!
"Even if you dont like the storyline, this is a must see for the graphics. Very positive messages. Go see it!"
Amazing! My kids and I enjoyed the movie!
"Ten stars! It was soooo amazing how the movie was made and so much like the animated version. I would see it again, for sure."
The visuals underwater were awesome. Loved the songs! Casting was incredible and on point. My daughter really enjoyed it. She laughed and cried.
Great movie!!!!! Gotta find another grandchild so I can go again
"It was good. Her voice was beautiful, but still wish she looked like the original Ariel."
"It was visually stunning, the best live action movie by Disney yet. I love you made me cry Ariel and Eric was hot! It was just a beautiful movie"
Great CGI. Perfect family friendly movie.
It was amazing. We loved it. The acting was so good. I took my teenage sons who never even seen the cartoon and they loved it too. Really emotional too. Soo good.
PERFECT!!! I Loved It!!!!
"I loved the remake....3d was more spectacular for me, my 5, 8 and 12 year old girls."
Amazing! Melissa Mcarthy killed it as Ursula!
"Great movie, I loved the music."
I enjoyed the movies. Went with my granddaughter and she loved it as well.
"It was magical. Halle is beautiful. The new songs added to the story. Only thing I missed was the chef scene from the original, I was curious how they were going to do that."
"I really liked it. I don't normally like remakes of my favorites, but loved the changes. Wish I would have realized it wasn't in 3D. I really wanted to see it in 3D"
"What a fantastic adaptation! The music, costumes, and subtle differences made this one better than the cartoon. Definitely would recommend."
"Totally loved it. I felt every moment of the movie. The songs, the love, the heart felt sadness and JOY!! Marvelous. Can’t wait to see it again!"
We loved Halle.  The graphics and special effects were beautiful. We liked it better than the original Little Mermaid.
We loved it. It staid true to the original
Disney did this remake justice. Halle was a great version of Ariel Her voice is beautiful and he acting was beyond great
"Melissa McCarthy played the perfect Ursula. The movie mostly followed the original. Ariel was beautiful and I am so happy to see more diverse characters. Grimsby was fantastic. Loved that they added some more scenes to showcase who Eric was. The only real let down was that Triton didn’t feel like a dad who was worried about his little girl. He was sort of flat and didn’t have much chemistry with other characters at all. That could be the CGI making it harder to get into character, I guess. Overall, it was nostalgic and beautiful! Loooooved the Scuttlebutt song!"
"The story was told beautifully and aligned closely with the original. Finally, a live action movie that I love."
Movie was very well done.  Exceeded my expectations!
I loved this movie the 3 D version just wonderful. I just loved everything about it
"It is amazing!! The music the color , highly recommended"
Amazing. I watched it when i was little & now I brought my little girl & hubby. It was beautiful
"I thought it was better than the original.  The characters and story are fleshed out, giving them a substance the animated film lacked.  I like the animated film, however, I thought the live action improved upon it.   Halle and Melissa were wonderful in there roles and I loved the addition of the three new songs."
The best Disney remake of any classic.
"Moved a little slowly, Missing the chef"
AMAZING MOVIE!! Phenomenal job to the entire cast!!!
Beautiful movie & spectacular casting
They made it feel real. The new Ariel was amazing. Major upgrade.
"Loved it!!  The music the live action, stuck to orignal story.  Just awesome for the while family"
The entire movie was excellent!!! It crossed cultural and racial barriers!!
Faithful to the original but with some updates to geography and the people that inhabit the Caribbean.
Melissa McCarthy A+ Music A+ Jonah(Eric) A+ Sebastian A+ VFX A+ Directing A+ An incredibly difficult task to remake a classic. They knocked it out of the park. Well done
Absolutely awesome movie!!!
Actors did a great job.  singing was way too loud at times.  that may have been controlled by the theater. A few parts may have been alarming to smaller children. Not sure if this was announced or not.
I loved it because the whole Disney movie was very good with people. The performance of the little mermaid was excellent. That voice was excellent.
Was a great movie the wife loved it
"Adored the original loved the new version. Halle is a phenomenal Ariel. Jonah made me love my fave Disney prince even more. Missed some of the old songs, but the new ones are 🔥 too!"
It was amazingly beautiful! One of the best live action remakes theyve ever done! Halle was incredible and so beautiful! My only complaint would be how dirty they did Flounder. He looked like a pancake.
Amazing!!! Brought back childhood memories
The changes they made but still good.
Great movie! Kids loved it
Loved the added storyline with Prince Eric and Ariel
Loved it!!!! Her voice is amazing!
Best movie of the 2023!!
"Beautiful underwater effects, story follows the original well, cast and singing was wonderful!"
"I absolutely loved this movie. It was full of life. Made tear up, laugh and smile at how amazing the actors did."
Graphics and singing were outstanding!
Worth the hype/wait. Excellent film. Disney nailed this one.
Love it!! Amazing songs. New touch and keep good things of the old movie. Halle Bailey is amazing. Great movie.
Phenomenal! It paid great homage to the original. The familiar songs and characters and new songs as well. The scenes were lifelike and great! A must see! Great job!
I like it because it was an amazing movie. I might want to see it again.
I loved the fresh take on a childhood favorite of mine. I’ve been reluctant to share original animation to my kids cause it’s so white and sexist. Great cast and thrilled to show my kids even if they were scared of Ursula.
"Solid film, great songs- new and old. McCarthy was great and Halle got the job done, she was good. It’s not without its flaws, mainly the questionable CGI at times, but it’s a fun film."
Awesome love Halle her singing would give me chills nostalgia Simone Ashley was in it but only for a sec wish she would’ve had more dialogue
"The reimagining of the movie for the 5% is out there where to go. My 6 year old lost interest, and wanted to go home early."
I loved the movie from the music the new songs everything was amazing can't wait to watch again so many times.
Love the culture mix!!!
I watched it in 3D. It’s the first movie my daughter has actually watched from beginning to end. I really enjoyed everything about the movie.
Loved it such a diverse cast
Halle Bailey was phenomenal! I loved everything about it
The actors were great!
Going to see it again
"It was great, such a sweet and endearing story"
"Lead roles had good chemistry and the vocals were amazing, loved the new story telling"
"The Little Mermaid 

As a live version and the characters that starred in the movie was amazing and the Directors, Producers, Stage managers, the whole team, giving credit to bringing Alvin Alley, in was perfect timing.  
The culture the diverse in the characters of different walks the colors and the costumes in characters was the best out of all the live movie versions of Disneys.

Halle Bailey as The Little Mermaid, did an amazing job, a gift, well done, sang, yes! The abs on her, you could tell the hard work that was put in she owned it for all the characters it came from within.  In swimming to the acting and the singing, you can tell was physically, mentally and spiritually intense, for her. Prince Eric, Jonah Hauer, yes, you did it all.  For Art Malik as Grimsby, you played an excellent role!  

Awkwafina voices of Scuttle, they had her play that role and all she put in, perfect,  The hard work! Thank you!

Javier Bardem portrays King Triton, Ariel's protective father and ruler of the sea. Omg, he was outstanding yes, all of the sisters were beautiful, ""Hamilton"" and ""Snowpiercer"" star Daveed Diggs voice of Sebastian the crab, well done 

Melissa McCarthy as she gave up her Ursula wig, (awesome) and learned to swim like 'a creature who lives in the water, this is amazing with everyone who had a role in water had to do the same.  Although she did a well twist spin on the song and acting.

Jessica Alexander who played the role of Vanessa, Ursula's human alter-ego.  Well done!

The original Ursula still was a better version to me, in the cartoon Disney Classic.  

All put in the hard work in preparation for their roles and what they had to work through in watching the original version to getting it to taking direction and learning the lines roles and getting and staying into the characters.

For all of Ariels sister beautiful I just wish we would have see more of them as the original,  flounder was amazing, but I think for him being Ariels best friend in the original they fell short of his role to play, we needed to see more of him. But the rest of the animals character carried the movie. 

The digitally, computer graphics were amazing on knowing the levitating movements were very real, everyone that took part amazing!  

Listening to the children in the theater was so funny.  I grew up on Disney and will remain through it all, I would even see it again, thats how much I enjoyed.  Thank you!
Blessings"
A great mix of the old version with new!
"This movie was absolutely amazing! Everyone did a great job, vocals, acting, music, scenery superb! This has been by far the best remake in history!!!!! Love"
I loved it!!! They didn’t change the story
Loved not a lot of singing.  Graphics were on point and up to date.  I saw Little Mermaid as a little girl.  They did right by this historic movie.
Amazing wonderful to watch great for the whole family
Movie was great! They chose the perfect person to play The Little Mermaid.
I was just thinking how beautiful it made.
"I feel like a kid again, dreaming of becoming a princess 😍"
Her voice is so magical ✨
"It was a pretty good movie. Took my daughter. I take off points because of the terrible accent for Sebastian. Really not that hard to find a Caribbean voice actor, did him injustice."
Just Loved it!! The entire movie was Awesome!!
"Very good movie, Ursula's very angry scene might be very scary for small children, the end had me in tears, very touching!"
Great live action from Disney! Bravo!
Excellent 👍 in every way... Go Disney you made him proud!
"This movie was so adorably charming. the CGI was NOT that bad. it had quality kids would like. it was fine. 
Halle was so charming as Ariel and Perfect. if you didn't like the movie it had nothing to do with her performance.  my niece loved it. the songs were fun, and Halle's Part of your world was stunning. 
Daveed and Awkafina were perfectly cast. I loved the back story on Eric and the mermaids of all the seas. 

great movie."
Definitely a must see had me from the start of the movie to the end!! Sebastian was definitely a great laugh during the whole movie!! The music is excellent had me and my friend singing along!! I'll be going to see it again
"We cheered, we cried and we smiled throughout the whole movie! Halle Bailey is the prefect Ariel. She brought so much passion and emotion to Ariel bringing her to life for a new experience that all ages can love and enjoy! Rob Marshall did an amazing job casting, the songs and the visuals! I can’t wait to see it again and again!"
Halle sang her face off…
It was refreshing and good. I give it a thumbs up 👍
This movie was everything
"best live action disney movie ever, really inspiring for young black and brown girls to see someone that looks like them! congrats halle on the amazing performance"
Just scary enough for a seven year old. Great special effects.
To long the story could have been told in half the time. The CGI was terrible as well.
I loved every aspect of this movie! Halle Bailey was the perfect Ariel and her voice is beautiful beyond words. This is my second time seeing this film and the details are amazing! Every actor brought each character to life and the new songs are just as amazing as the originals.
Beautiful singing and visuals
I loved everything about this movie. Halle did an amazing job.
Cute! Enjoyable. We had fun
I missed the magical moment where triton gives Ariel the dress and she walks out of the water with it at the end.
Beautiful 20/10 highly recommend
My daughters and I enjoyed it very much.
"movie aligned with the original cartoon with some updated cultural appropriation.  the singing for Ariel was awesome.b the prince guy singing almost made me walk out and leave my kids..the movie was mostly CGI , they should of follow suit and made it more vibrant and amazing like avatar. yet it seemed dull and visually lacking . .."
Critics know nothing!  This was FAR better and realistic than the animated movie and I enjoyed the animated movie. Rob Marshall had the right idea and the ending is more powerful for all especially Ariel.
Amazing and they kept it like the original only better! Love how diverse the characters were!
"We loved everything about the movie! There were a few changes from the original, but they were good changes. I definitely recommend watching it."
The Little Mermaid was Amazing! The cast is out of this world. And the singing will just send chills do your spine! 2up
"Melissa McCarthy stole the show.
Awesome!"
Loved it! Must see! Halle Bailey was amazing and is the perfect Ariel!
amazing graphics I cried three times
The entire movie was very good. I like the old version but LOVE the newer version.
My daughters loved it!!!
my mom and I liked it the whole movie.
Amazing really enjoyed wonderful movie
Loved the new song and loved the movie
Great cast and movie ! Love everything even the new songs
Beautiful  incredible adaptation. Halle is perfect.
It was really good and much better than I thought it would be. Definitely recommend
I loved Halle Bailey singing and the song under the sea
I like the new songs. The actors were wonderful.!!!
Enjoyed the entire movie
I don’t know about the younger generation but the older generation that grew up on this gem  as kids sure were happy with how they created this film. I smiled the whole time. Everyone outdid themself especially Melissa and Halle. A definite Must see. Xx
the little mermaid was so amazing and beautiful all the acting and singing was stunning made me cry at the credits halle bailey was a great and amazing pick to play airel
"Not too bad! Probably the best of the live action disney remakes. I havent been a huge fan of them but this one works the best.

All the characters were cast well. Javier Bardem as King Triton was perfect. The colors were dazzling.

Ariel's voice was amazing.

Was a live action remake necessary? No. Did this one do the job well though? Yes."
"One of the best— If not THE BEST—live action adaptations of a beloved cartoon classic Ive ever seen. It was true to the original with music and theme, but added enough new (original songs, continuation of verses to fit new story) that kept it fresh. It was perfectly cast and entertained my husband and I (both mid 40s who loved the original) and our two sons (19 and 8). So happy we went to the theater for this one!"
Didn’t keep the little kids attention but super good for the older ones .
"The movie was awesome
I loved everything about it
Especially the 3D
Hallie did a great job
It was BEAUTIFUL"
3D Was great.  I liked that they kept some original content and songs but liked the new twists.
"Story stayed true to the original, and the singing was absolutely amazing!"
"I thought the design of the ocean was beautiful. Great scenery filmed in Sardona, Italy,  Great love story although Ariel is a teenager and Eric is an adult at 21 yrs of age.  I can't see her enjoying the life being on a ship.  Crowd clapped during the performance of the songs though."
I thought the movie was well done matched the cartoon to a tee I would definitely go see it again
Me and my daughter loved the movie a lot she was sing along and dancing in the chair lol
Loved the colors and the 3D. Highly recommend this movie in 3D!
It was a great movie !!
The experience was great!  I loved everything
"3D graphics were phenomenal, I  truly enjoyed it with my two granddaughters."
Loved the sea creatures…. Eric’s new Song … Ursula the king and of course the little Mermaid!!💋
I loved the 3D picture and all of the visual effects.  Halle Bailey did an awesome job playing the role of Ariel.
"That was transformative! I already knew she had the chips vocally (seriously astounding), but I never knew how capable she was as an actor. Every single scene she is in, she pulled you in and it was the most endearing thing. All the characters were great and the colors were so amazing to see. We all had the time of our lives. Going to see it again for sure!"
I loved the Caribbean feel
It was a great movie. Especially in 4d. Her voice. The action. Best movie ever
incredible movie. worth the watch. 100%
I loved this movie as a child and this definitely gave me all the feelings of nostalgia. I loved the casting for this movie. Sebastian and Scuttle were so funny. it was such an enjoyable movie to watch.
"Great movie. So enjoyable with my granddaughters. Fun, cute, beautiful photography"
Its was enchanting and diverse!
Well crafted and entertaining.
"Excellent remake!!! I loved all the diversity I saw. They did an excellent job with casting, incorporating new songs, and making small changes to the original story. I loved it!!!"
I loved the fact that it stayed close to the original but also had a lot of differences. They had the same songs and a few new songs. It brought me back to watching it as a child. I loved everything the ending was so great. Would definitely see it again.
Really great film. The lead actress has an amazing voice!
Great live action rendition to a Disney classic!!
Movie is great however the t heather had no a/c
Great movie for the family.
"Absolutely loved it. Amazing cast. Halle Bailey couldn't be beat in this role and had great chemistry with her co-star. Some parts of the storyline changed slightly but for the better. The newly added songs are great and complement the existing favorites perfectly. 
At over 2 hours in length it may be a little too long for the littlest kids but it never felt too long. 
We watched ithe movie a 2nd time, after seeing it on IMAX, this time in 3D. Probably preferred the visual appeal of 3D."
Very moving and beautifully done.  Loved the new and old songs
Very much like the cartoon. Kinda to long
Movie was great ! The theater bathrooms were nasty and no paper towels. Most of the drink machines were out.
Great Live Action Remake! Some subtle changes to the classic. Melissa McCarthy was awesome!! Overall...Great film!
"Halle was absolutely amazing, Melissa McCarthy was dramatic perfection and Javier Bardeim embodied King Triton  like none other! Wonderful movie!"
The beginning was boring for me. And after she found out that the witch had the necklace with her voice the movie went by so fast and finished.
Halle was the PERFECT choice for the role! BEAUTIFUL VOICE!!
Subpar acting.  There are too many changes from the original movie.  too long and drawn out.  made an 80 minute classic movie drawn out to 130 mins.  now worth the money to see in theater.  wait for Disney plus.
"The colors were washed out, it felt like I was looking through foggy goggles, the characters seemed forced. The movie volume was not loud enough. I could hear the person next to me chewing. It was an awful experience."
"Great acting, singing. Funny and awesome animation"
Very good. Lots of action. Liked the story line. Beautiful colors.
Phenomenal movie! I always side eye Disney when it comes to the live actions but they really surprised me with this. Prince Eric and Ursula performance really blew me away!! Not a fan of Scuttle. Just didn’t do it for me. Other than that one character the movie was great from beginning to end! Definitely go see. Also it’s a little lengthy in my opinion. Just a heads up for the kiddos that may get restless.
Classic with an amazing twist! Great fathers day movie to watch for fathers and their daughters. 10/10
"It was absolutely amazing! 10/10! From the cast to the scenes, to the set and design. Everything was great! Must see!"
Loved Halle Bailey's and Jonah Hauer King's performances. They stole the show
It is beautifully executed! Halles voice is unreal! The movie moved me to tears in the best way possible.
The scenes were so real & beautiful.  Took my granddaughter & we both loved it.
The music was AMAZING!!!!
"The movie was amazing , funny and interesting all at the same time. I and my family and kids saw this movie together and it literally had my sons on the edge of their seats . We all this this movie so much"
great movie can't wait for the vinyl to come out
Best Disney remake EVER!!!!
Loved it! Live the modernization without taking from the original story line.
great movie. loved songs and animals
We liked it. I struggled seeing Skuttle.and not Awqwafina.
The movie was awesome expanded version of what Ariel was experiencing as a human was awesome.
Loved it. The leads did great. She was a true fidget princess!
I think they did a great job on the live action. They only had a couple a slow parts but over lol great movie.
Not bad! Just not what I thought
That was the best remake of a movie ever!  We'll go watch it again and again just to hear those melodies in Halle's voice so angelically.  This beautiful masterpiece will forever hold a place in our hearts and our collection.
Absolutely LOVED this movie!!!
This movie was absolutely amazing from beginning to end! The representation in this movie was what the inner child in me needed!!
Absolutely stunning!!!
I liked everything. Movie was a heat
It was amazing. Loved everything about it.
Horrible casting and song re-mix. Broke everyone’s childhood memories.
All the added songs were great!!
I love it was amazing
Excellent rendition of the original!!  I loved the diversity
Beautiful scenery and musical accompaniment. Lots of dramatic twists and unexpected plot points! Would definitely recommend a watch (ps. leave the kids at home for the sake of everyone else. wait. until. it's. on. disney. )
Visually breathtaking!! You must see this movie in 3D
It was refreshing…it was beautiful and all things magical! Such a diverse cast and with so much chemistry…loved from start to finish 🧜🏽‍♀️
"Loved ::::
The beautiful colors . The songs 
No dislikes"
I loved the movie. Me and my grandchildren had a ball. The movie theater was clean and comfortable
really beautiful cinematography
"The movie was great The young lady who played Ariel did a great job, beautiful voice beautiful actress it was all-around good"
I didnt expect so much to be different from the original.
It was beautiful. Not only did we love it but our daughter enjoyed it as well. Wish we could've given it 10 stars. Definitely will be going to see it again with the other kids.
"Halle Bailey, Melissa McCarthey and Daveed  Diggs understood the assignment."
"It was 98% to the original movie, the cast was peeeeeeeeeeeeerfect from Ariel to Sebastian, the 2 % I didnt give them is because I would of loooove to see Sebastian running on the kitchen, the Seagull was a boy, also some songs that were Joy part of the movie and some other small details like Ariel brushing her hair while eating dinner and Ursula saying my poor little poops instead of my babies ."
Loved it! So did my girls! Anything set outside of a Denmark is a deviation from the original story so Im okay with the new faces! Will watch again.
"Awesome movie.  We saw it in 3-D which made it even better.  It followed the original story very well, and the songs were great.  We will watch it again."
"This Movie is SO GOOD! It is everything that I'd hoped for. Halle Bailey is a SUPERSTAR. Between her MAGNIFICENT Voice & Acting Chops, she is a Force to be Reckoned With for decades to come. It doesn't hurt she is SUPER CUTE and one of the most Beautiful women in Film today!!!

Oh, by the way, Melissa McCarthy was Eye Poppingly Wonderful!! She showed range I never thought she had!! This movie is going to get her a lot more work when casting directors see how AMAZING she is in this movie. Obviously, same goes for Halle Bailey. What a performance!!

If it has a knock, and I'm NOT saying it does, it could have been 20 minutes shorter.

I REALLY loved this Movie, and I am in my 40's."
Loved it!  There were multiple messages in  this movie ! Love them all!
This movie is great. Halle Bailey is phenomenal and the other actors are absolutely fantastic. This movie is definitely a must see.
I enjoyed the original LM with my niece and itll always be one of my favorites. This time Im with my own daughter and I love it even more!
It was an incredibly great movie! I am going to go see it again!
My granddaughter and I loved the movie. Halle Bailey is amazing. She has a Beautiful Voice.
"I wasn’t expecting it to be as good as it was. My daughter and I wanted to see it again as soon as it ended. Excellent job by the entire cast!! If you’re debating, trust, you will not be disappointed."
"Loved the movie, my granddaughter and nieces were so excited to see it. It did not dispoint, color was beautiful and the singing was great..."
"Was very theatrical and movie had it's moments of spectacle. I thoroughly enjoyed, it's a great family film."
"This movie was amazing, Halle was the perfect actress to play Ariel"
So amazing! Enjoyed every minute of it.
I loved this movie so much!!  Halle Bailey was born for this role!! TWO THUMBS UP and FIVE STARS!!
Phenomenal movie! Me and my daughter loved it
"Little mermaid was and still is one of my favorite movies. It was good for the culture to have a black mermaid, however they could have stayed true to the movie. The white girl gets saved and gets to live happily ever after but the black one is the hero. when will we get saved and stop trying to save everybody. the movie could have gone without the extra scenes and how did they drop the scene with Sébastien and the cook fighting. that was epic. why?"
Very entertaining.  Great cast of actors.  I recommend the movie
"This movie in 3-D was surprisingly amazing I love the way the images jumped off the screen. 10,000 stars I highly recommend this film."
The movie was awesome from start to finish!
We loved Halle as Ariel and the diversity of the movie! Everyone from different ethnicity and background from the cast and the mermaids made the movie superb! I like the message that Disney portrayed which is what we need in society today. Peace. Love and UNITY
She loved it! Boy have we evolved since the first version 34 years ago!  My daughter loved it and very appropriate as she is biracial so thank you!! Great movie the kids in the movie laughed and cheered.
I love this movie so much I a must see for all Disney lovers 😀
Movie was as great as animated version. It was well cast and delivered wonderfully!
I love this movie its my all time favorite movie   going to see it again.
This was executed extremely well and did not disappoint.
"First of all, the new mermaid is beautiful! The overall message of the movie was very timely. Having seen the cartoon 1 million times, I thought that I would know this movie very well. I love the additions they have made to make the movie fresh. Very much recommend!"
our girls were ingagde the entire movie sing dancing in their seats.
This movie was amazing. Halle Bailey gave Ariel made it a a reality that all dreams can come true for all little girls.  They have to remember that you dont have to give something up just to be heard by the ones you love.
"Wonderful live action remake! Halle Berry has a powerful voice. Enjoyed Daveed Diggs as Sebastian, Akwafina as Scuttle. Lin Manuel Miranda added several great songs which added a nice update. I do think Melissa McCarthy was alittle scary for really small kids. She made a wicked splash as Ursula. Go & enjoy"
"The storyline, and plot was accurate to the original one. I really enjoyed it! Lots of humor, action and touching scenes."
Great color and music.
Loved the new music and expanded story.  Didn't care for the prince's backstory as I don't feel it made a whole lot of sense for the movie as a whole.
Loved Melissa McCarthy!
Beautiful singing voice and beautiful mermaid!
"A MUST SEE for Disney fans !  I have seen The Little Mermaid twice and will probably see it again in the theater.  I have also bought the soundtrack. The acting, the special effects, the costumes, the music, the underwater and shoreline scenery -- it's all great !"
A classic favorite! Totally worth going to the theater to see it!!
Held the kid’s attention great Movie
Wonderful movie I love you it
Amazing movie! Loved it!
Loved the movie! I liked the scenes they added to make the storyline a bit more complete. No longer just Ariel giving up everything for a pretty boy lol. Also loved Halle! She just has princess energy and such a beautiful voice!
This movie was all and then more. I'm such a big kid at heart. I loved it 😍 ❤️
It was everything you thought it was going to be times 10
Visually stunning. I loved every minute of it
It was very well done. The storyline stayed relatively the same and the color was amazing.
Great ! Classic movie
Excellent Movie. Heart touching. A must see movie.
"Beautifully shot, very funny, the new songs were great!"
"Truly an amazing movie, Oscar worthy  for sure,  HB was magnificent!!!"
I absolutely love the movie. The acting and singing were just terrific!
"Great songs and performances, Halle was wonderful as Ariel!"
"Eh, so so. Nice ending"
Great adaptation of the movie. Halle Bailey is a superstar!!
Awesome remake!!! Halle and cast did an impeccable job!!!!
"This not only has all of the charm of the original, but the additions fit in very well. One of Disneys best reimagined classics."
A awesome movie love it
One song Lin Manuel Miranda should take back and then a solid 4 star movie otherwise.
Incredible effects with beautiful shots. 3D is a must. The storyline stayed true with a few deviations. Absolutely loved it!
The story line was great and just great characters and singing.
Great overall movie!
Absolutely amazing. Musical scenes and music was amazing. Halle did a great job bringing Ariel to life.
Too long but amazing visually.  Great old music.
"Absolute perfection and addressed all the deeply problematic, shallow things about the original"
Halle's voice is angelic and it was fun to watch this remake of a childhood favorite.
"My very first movie I saw in the theater was The Little Mermaid, the animated version and now I took my children to see this as their first movie! It did not disappoint. It was just as good as the first one."
My girls & I Love it
Easily the most emotional live action remake! Such a great movie!
Amazing and beautiful movie
Loved it! Music and costumes were fantastic!
"Liked the special effects, but towards the end of the movie it might be a little scary for young kids."
"Great movie! Although the cast did a great job, Halle Bailey had a standout performance. My daughters and I really enjoyed it."
amazing!! Sooo good!!!
beautiful remake of the original. Halle girl u killed it congrats.
I guess the non-animated version probably wasnt the best choice for my granddaughters to see the movie.  Overall it was ok. Not as attention - capturing as the original since it was more of a novelty idea.
I absolutely loved the movie. Very good remake
This movie is amazing!!! Love love love it!
Halle did an AMAZING job.
Absolutely fun movie!  Beautifully made and wonderfully casted!
It was soo good. Such a fun and captivating watch. Halle was definitely the stand out performance though everyone else did quite well. I only wish Ariel had more elaborate costumes. But I already can't wait to watch again.
The acting is amazing and it looks so realistic! I love this movie so much and so does my daughter!
I loved it and so did my family!  The Under water scenes were Breathtaking! And the Little Mermain Out-did herself!
I cried several times. Simply loved this live action remake.
"My entire family went together to see this movie. This includes my 5 nieces, who all loved it and asked to come back and see it again. I loved it. The only thing that mattered to me was the smiles on their faces. The Halle is getting because of this role is Very disgusting."
"I loved Ariel, she was so beautiful and an incredible singer. I loved the take on live action looking animals."
Love it! Very close to the original
The movie was good. Actually better than the cartoon that came out during my childhood. Its a must see.
Ursula was a little much.  More Ariel less Sea Witch.  Everything else was very entertaining.   Way too long.  Kids in theater were getting restless.
Such an AMAZING live action remake. :-)
"Movies kept on pausing and stopped for 15 min!
However towed the end they gave us free passes to the next movies!"
"Absolutely one of the best movies I've seen! 
The added parts were phenomenal!
I loved it!!"
"I really loved this. Never been too into the live action remakes, but this was beautifully done Halle Bailey was amazing. And even as someone who grew up on the original, there were things here they were able to flesh out. Eric is a much more developed character., there relationship feels organic. Most of it is gorgeous. Highly recommend."
Run don’t walk to see this movie. I had a ton of fun watching and felt totally immersed in the little mermaid universe.
Halle was AMAZING my daughter was inspired. All she kept saying was i love her look  mommy i wanna sing like her !!!!  20 stars for HALLE! The movie was incredible! Each character held it down. !
"I liked everything from the cast, acting, music. Hallie Bailey was AMAZING!"
Beautifully done! Halle Bailey was perfect. The changes were subtle but meaningful. So happy for the generation who gets to grow up with this reimagined classic.
Amazing Cinematography!!! FULL OF COLOR!!!! 🧜🏾‍♀️🧜🏾‍♀️🧜🏾‍♀️🧜🏾‍♀️🧜🏾‍♀️🧜🏾‍♀️🧜🏾‍♀️🧜🏾‍♀️🧜🏾‍♀️🧜🏾‍♀️
Our 5 year old granddaughter was mesmerized. The singing was better than the original. Very well done.
it was amazing I absolutely loved it it was incredible very good movie
"Bravo! Such a beautiful movie, it kept with the best parts of the original and made it even better (and funnier)! Every actor was perfect for the role from Ariel to Scuttle. We loved it!"
I love the movie it brought me back so many memories when my little girl was little the singing and Actors were Wonderful..
Grandchildren age 6 and 9 loved it
Good movie! Stayed pretty true to the original animated film.
Just beautiful!!!!!!!!!
More action less talking. Under the sea was a welcome to my child memory ❤️
"As a full grown adult who named her first daughter Ariel, favorite Disney Movie Princess, I absolutely loved this version! My 2 daughters loved it as well!!"
Halle and the cast did an amazing job in bringing the story to real life.
"I liked the story and Disney never disappoints when they put little characters in, to make us all laugh"
"I loved it. All the music was good, the comedy was funny. The women stood out, Hallie, Melissa and Awkwafina were amazing. It made me feel good."
Halle killed this role. Singing? Superb. Acting? Superb. Everything about her? Superb. Loved every second. The romance was so believable and made me swoon.
"Absolutely loved it. It had many nods to the original, but still made it relevant for today. In the end, love conquers hate."
"It was a beautiful reimagining of The Little Mermaid. Halle Bailey is luminous and has a stunning voice. She perfectly embodies Ariel. Melissa McCarthy was a delight as Ursula. Javier Bardem made a great King Triton. Jonah is so handsome and talented. The whole cast was wonderful. The film is a visual and auditory treat. The orchestrations were well done. The three new songs were unnecessary, but they werent bad. Okay, Scuttlebutt was kinda bad.  Overall, though, the movie hit all the right spots for this huge longtime fan of TLM. I did fight to hold back my sobs towards the end. I am deeply moved.  Thank you Rob Marshall, Alan Menken, Howard Ashman, and Lin-Manuel Miranda for this gift."
This movie is fantastic.
It runs a bit by long. Lots of younger viewers needed a beak or some two. Visually it is pretty remarkable.
"Loved it! Stayed true to the original, and Halle has such a beautiful voice 😍"
"Mellisa McCarthy was amazing as Ursula.  Awesome graphics for the water scenes.  Missed the part they eliminated for Sbastien almost being cooked, they should have found a way to include it. Really enjoyed the movie but they were trying so hard to be New and PC that they left some of the fun and quotable lines from the original story."
Halle Bailey was astonishing! Very fun and cute movie.
It was a fantastic movie
"Loved every minute of it, almost as much as my granddaughter did 💜"
"Im not crying, yall are. Marvelous movie."
"Absolutely amazing, hit all the nostalgic parts also revitalized it with some modern takes to it. Loved it will watch again for sure!"
"I loveeee this movie! The kids and the adults both enjoy such a great remake of the classic little mermaid! Halle Bailey was magnificent in this performance, such grace bringing the little mermaid back to life in this new generation! Can’t wait for what Disney prepare next!💜"
It was a beautiful movie we enjoyed it
Incredible and wonderful everyone did a great job. Halle did a brilliant job
Super cute! Kids loved it!
Halle Bailey is my ariel all the way the animated movie was my favorite movie growing up and the first movie I saw in theaters so I went to see this one for nostalgia I loved it when she sang part of your world I literally cried i know this movie will mean a lot to so many little girls  and it doesn't disappoint
"Not as magical as the original, but then I'm not 12 still either.  But this is sweet and charming and great under the sea CG."
"it was an amazing movie, my girls loved it"
"the underwater scenes looked amazing. All the songs you loved are in it and done well. 
only thing not really needed was Prince Eric's song. Definitely good family movie."
"Great acting, visuals and songs! Best live action remake of Disney so far."
A perfect remake to a classic. Love the cast. Beautiful story come to life.
"I love that Disney reimagined this beautiful classic! Some of the new songs felt a bit forced, but the film, the acting and the cgi was magical!"
"Wonder Movie! Great acting, Hallie Bailey was perfect for this role. Her essence was everything. Jonah Hauer-King was great as Eric. Melissa McCarthy was a great  villain character coming from a predominately humorous roles. Best CGI ever."
Black mermaid representation in beautiful sea colors was inspiring including other cultures were represented under the sea.Fun musical scenes.Enjoyed the loving relationship between a father & daughter.There was great comedic moments from the accompanying cast of sea creatures
Phenomenal movie!! The kids really enjoyed it in 3D!!
Absolutely amazing! The cast the flow of the movie itself! Loved it
Beautiful!! I love the under water world they created!! Its the classic story but better!!
One of the best movies I've seen in a while
"The cgi was horrible and the auto tune for the voices was too fake. They strayed from the actual story plot too much and a lot of things didnt make sense. Its worth going to see just to say youve seen it, but youll unfortunately leave underwhelmed.  2 stars"
The movie overall was cute but missed a lot of core elements from the original animated movie. I was literally falling asleep in the middle of the movie due to the large pauses.
Colors wee beautiful  dining was fantastic  and the villan was GREAT
Loved every minute of it!
Loved that the plot/ story aligned with the original movie. The original songs were included and I thought it was cute that the original Ariel was a part of the movie too.
Great job Disney.   Paid homage to the OG.
I loved it! It was better than the original! Halle Bailey did a wonderful job.  The cinematography was beautiful!  I just absolutely loved it.  Awkwafina’s song was so cute!
Melissa McCartthy stole the show! Changed a little of the story and added new songs. My grandchildren and I loved it!
I knew what was going to happen so I wish something would’ve been added but overall 8/10 singing was great. “Eric” could’ve been better. Almost a replica of the original
The diversity of the cast and the special effects were great!
I loved this version. The cinematography was superior and Halle Bailey did an exceptional job as the Little Mermaid. Visually beautiful masterpiece.
"This movie was such a great rendition of the original, obviously things were different because it was live action but I think the cast did an amazing job. I don’t have any issues with the few changes they made to movie to keep up with the times. The vocals were top notch and the acting from the lead roles were right on point. I would definitely see it again and if you haven’t seen don’t allow negative review dissuade from forming your opinion on it. Unfortunately the times we’re living in is causing people give low reviews simply because of the lead actress race(simply just sad world)."
"We loved the music and the Kiss the Girl scene, Im also glad they stuck to the original story line"
The singing was awesome and the cast was great
"a visually beautiful film. one song went on too long in my opinion and one sequence was too short. If the song would have been cut short for the film, that time given to the sequence at the end, and one more thing I don't want to say but it wouldn't add time just change a scene it would have been as close. to a perfect live action you could get. It's my favorite of the live action remakes."
a new spin on the animated classic
"Phenomenal movie. Loved the new songs. Loved the end scene with Ariel and Dad. I saw the original when I was 9 in 1989 and I'm so thankful to be able to take my 9 year old to see a movie I loved so much. My daughter  enjoyed it as well and keeps saying ""Skuttlebutt""."
Was soooooo amazing! It completely exceeded my expectations!
"Wonderful movie. I love that they stayed close to the original animated movie but, also added to it. Halle was an incredible Ariel. Melissa McCartney crushed it as Ursula."
Music and animation were fabulous!
We all over the movie!!  The time flew by!!!
Cinematography was amazing
"stop making these, please. either make it all CG or don't, or at least give us something new. would have been less wack if all the songs were new or if they just dropped the musical aspect all together. didn't feel like it was for the kids and it didn't feel like it was for fans of the original either, so who is this for besides Disney? pretty much felt like Disney giving itself a pat on the back for a job well done 40 years ago and cashing in on that a second time with a fraction of the effort. I'd never spend money on this and I regret doing so, only went because my girlfriend is susceptible to their marketing tactics. both thumbs down."
it was different than the original. it was delightful. Halle was lovely and has a beautiful singing voice. She added charm to the character. I especially like the ending.  Not just a wedding but the couple left to do something for the world together.
"other than the whole thing about changing Ariel's race for no reason, the movie was fantastic. not sure why people are hating on it so much"
"This was absolutely incredible! Love that the main characters are more fleshed out! The chemistry btw Ariel and Eric, so good! And I’m gonna say it bc I’m not afraid to, This Version is Better than the Original 🤷🏾‍♂️ good jobs Disney you outdid yourself!!"
OMG! Yes the BEST LITTLE MERMAID EVER!
"Exceptional film! I loved everything about this one including the additional 40 mins of storyline. Halle Bailey as Ariel was captivating and those big, beautiful doe eyes were perfect for his film. I must also admit I loved the fact that one of her sisters had my name. The diversity in case was outstanding!! Plan to see it again next weekend!"
We love the way Disney brought life to The Little Mermaid. The singing was heartfelt. I felt like she was talking to all the little girls /women in the audience.
"movie was unbelievably perfect. couldn't have been any better. Disney actually made a perfect film. Don't follow hater critics. this movie beats the animated 1,000,000x 

a must see!!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥"
Fantastic job on the actors playing the various roles. LOVED Melissa McCarthy as Ursula! Can't think of anyone better to fulfill that role. Xavier Bardem as King Triton was spot on as well. Halle Berry was perfect for Ariel. What a beautiful voice she has!  Plenty of humor and a few tears as well.
"The movie was soooo good..had us all on the edge of our seats... even though you know what's going to happen,  it still left your holding your breath waiting to see the next scene..."
Way too many adds. Otherwise the movie its self was amazing . Im
"Love the beauty scenes, and the representations! What a magical masterpiece! One of the best Disney live action movies"
The action was awesome.
"The effects, the cast, everything was phenomenal"
"It was colorful, close to the original and the singing was great!"
Did not like the actor they chose for the little mermaid Disney could of done much better
The movie held all the magical elements of a Disney animated film. Halle was stunning and Melissa did a wonderful job as Ursula!! Must see.
"It was awesome our family entertainment, and the reinfection him of the characters in the all inclusiveness of the underwater world was fabulous"
"Excellent movie from start to finish!  Beautiful graphics, the music and signing was beautiful !  I'm going to see it again!"
"A lot different than the original, but still very good"
One of the best live action movies I have experienced.
I didnt receive my tickets until after the movie startef I was told basically thats my problem.
"It was beautifully presented, hailey played a great part and my daughter absolutely loved it !"
Amazing!  Absolutely loves it and so did my children who love the cartoon movie.  Beautiful costumes and amazing singing! Loved the new additions to the story.
What an awesome movie! Halle looked beautiful and sounded incredible! She really made the movie! The CGI effects and sound were outstanding in the IMAX theater! I would definitely watch it again!
Loved it! The actors were great beautiful movie!
Absolutely loved it as much as I love the animation as a child!
The music and animation was horrible. Waste of $$
"the movie was truly beautiful, made me tear up with how beautiful the ending was"
Really good real-life re-make! Go see!
Great casting choices! Halle was beautiful and has a great voice. The changes to the movie from the animated version were good and helped give more backstory to prince Eric.
The movie was fairly true to the original and pretty entertaining but the 2hr 15min runtime was a bit long for young ones
I like that the movie stayed with the original script. Good wholesome family movie.
So good! I cried at the end. It brought back so many memories watching the cartoon movie as a child over and over again. Disney nailed it! Halle was so wonderful!
"EXCELLENT movie! Great music, beautiful imagery and amazing acting. Will see again. Great job Disney"
The movie was phenomenal
"Entertaining. I missed some of the parts from the original movie, but overall it was good."
My daughter and I loved the movie.
I just didnt like Ariel didnt have red hair and flounder looked so weird but everything else was amazing !! And I loved the new song from Sebastian and the bird .. rica song sucked though but still didnt take from the movie it was still amazing !!
Wonderful cast and beautiful movie
I liked the whole entire movie. Wonderful! Cant wait to watch it again. I recommend it.
Amazing visuals and super likeable cast! A must see for anyone who grew up watching the animated little mermaid!!!
One of the best Disney live actions!
story was well transposed from book to animated version to live action. only felt like the animators went weak towards the end. got cheesy style animation around Ursula's transformation.
"I loved it! The movie was so refreshing!. I took my Good-Daughter, and we had an amazing time."
Visuals are amazing no doubt m. Opening act slightly rushed some original music missed the mark. MCartheys Ursula is def a positive stand out
The fact that it was pretty true to original animated version.  Love the new songs added.
Loved the entire movie!  The actors were good. Dresses and all outfitts were beautiful.
"After reading some of the reviews wow!  This world is a mess so any thing that can give hope, beauty and goodness is worth seeing.  Get over yourself people our kids need something special, no guns etc.!!"
what a beautiful movie 🎬
This movie was amazing!! I loved it and Halle was a perfect Ariel. If youre thinking about going just go!!!
The movie was done very well. I have nothing bad. All of the cast did a GREAT JOB.
love it so much very great job on the cast i wanna c it again
My favorite Disney movie EVER  PERFECT
"I was blown away by how good this was!! I did not have high expectations and thought it might be cringe. The graphics, underwater world, acting, singing, and storyline were impeccable. Halle Bailey is PERFECT."
I liked everything!!!
"Beautiful! The actors & actress’s were great. They really captured the nostalgia from the original movie, even if there was so much differences in this one."
"it pretty okay, didn't finish the whole movie because my daughter thought it was boring."
"I loved it so much whoever is a big little mermaid fan would absolutely love it, and you will not be disappointed 💜💚🩵🥰"
only 2nd live action remake better than the original (first being Cinderella)
It was such a good movie everyone did good
The movie was AMAZING!!! Halle and the cast did a great job!!! I would definitely go back to watch it again! It was just that good! 💜💙💜💙
"Great, awesome, and diverse casting. Loved Melissa McCarthy as Ursula, loved the funny role of Scuttle, loved the modern take yet familiar script, beautiful voices, and HALLE DID GREAT bringing Ariel to life! Oh, and my kids loved it too !"
Great acting and special effects!
The movie was outstanding! Halle Bailey's vocals and acting were perfect! Melissa McCarthy was great!
I liked that it kept to the script of the original movie..a few differences. but it was great..
The graphics were amazing! Performances stellar! Better than the original.
entertaining and visually stunning. a little long but we enjoyed it.
Very good. Worth the watch
"I went into this (one of my childhood absolute favorites) with, I would say, average expectations based on Disney live action remakes lately and determined not to listen to critics having an attitude based on skin color. Yes, being a mixed girl it of course is cool to see someone like me as Ariel but would Halle be convincing as Ariel? Would Disney muck up the songs I loved so much? Would Prince Eric be cast well? Would the movie keep its heart? Me and my kids and best friend went to see it and bottom line? Yes, the songs and sequences were awesome and yes it very much kept its heart. In fact there were a few times tears came to my eyes. Heck I didn’t even mind Awkafina as Scuttle and Melissa McCarthy did pretty well as Ursula. But Halle? Boy oh boy did she shine and capture this inner little girls heart as Ariel!! Not just her glow but her voice and she captured a very sweet, curious and naive Ariel. I also enjoyed for the most part the new songs added and the songs and sequences for the songs I already know like Under the Sea. And I like the realism of Sebastian, Scuttle and Flounder even though I was a bit worried that might be weird. Finally, I would encourage whoever is reading this to not listen to whatever criticism you might have read about “wokeness” or whatever in casting,. Halle was absolutely well cast. And I am so happy I saw this! And you better believe I will buy it when it comes out 3"
They did an amazing job! They made this story feel new but still feels like the original movie. The movie is truly beautiful.
This was the best remake and live adaptation Ive ever seen!! Loved every nostalgic moment of it!!
We Loved everything !!!
Amazing movie! The whole cast was phenomenal. Halle Bailey is truly a treasure and was perfect for this role in every way!
"Absolutely amazing!!  From beginning to end, it did not disappoint.  The entire cast was fabulous!!  so much emotion in Halle with her songs.  Loved it!!"
I absolutely loved the movie! It was so much like the original!!
I didnt dislike anything. I love that they changed kiss the girl to less predatory nature. My son is 3 and loved seeing Hallle
Halle was wonderful and I think they did an amazing job at bringing the story to life. Two of the songs were a little odd but I can get past that. Just an overall adorable movie.
"It was amazing! Beautiful, great songs, and we loved the new Ariel."
My kids didn't  cater to hit cause it wasn't  animated but all the adults loved it.
perfect casting! great movie and I loved every moment of it.  I will go see it again at a late showing so there are less small kids there.
I love it. The singing was awesome
This movie exceeded my expectations in every way. Ariels singing was incredible. The storyline was great. I could feel the emotion. Amazing job. Well done!
"It was a pretty good movie. The CGI and animation could have been a bit better: like Aquaman.
The story followed along with the original movie well, too, which was nice.
The concept of changing the ethnicity of the characters,  I feel, was something to do, but didn't absolutely have to be done.
 It was just to appease people who can't seem to be pleased with leaving things as they are. ""Inclusivity"" is not required to be a great movie, although certain people are making it out that way. 
Regardless, was nice."
I loved watching this movie in 3D I love the pretty colors the way the water looks I will definitely be coming to watch it again
Very good. I like it.
One of the best live action remakes.
"Watched TheLittleMermaid on May 25th in AMC Theatres and Halle Bailey playing Ariel was the best casting ever. She became an instant star with this film. This live-action remake retains the heart and soul of the story we know and love, and its elevates even further with the storyline giving that Romeo-Juliet tale mixed with little bit of Disney's Hercules especially when it comes to the whole sibling rivalry. I am not really that much of a Melissa McCarthy fan, but her portrayal of Ursula it felt like she channeled the late Pat Carroll all the way. The scenes with Ursula and Ariel felt like Hades-Hercules at the underworld with the whole backdrop of Ursula lair. Then the chemistry with Halle Bailey and Jonah-Hauer King is perfect, natural and the high point of this film. When it came to VFX it felt wonky at times with the underwater sequences, but the song titles like ""Under the Sea..."", ""Kiss the Girl..."" etc., made you forget about those things and focus on the melodies because they were soothing to hear. Also, Sebastian the Crab OMG he is a scene stealer in every scene and Daveed Diggs honors the late Samuel Wright perfectly with the Caribbean accent and his scenes with Ariel are wonderful to watch and serves as a second father to Ariel. Definitely this is another great live action Disney film and Halle Bailey commands the story beautifully with her acting and her singing. She definitely has a bright future ahead. Definitely 9 out of 10 for me."
"I loved the little mermaid, they changed it a little, but was still awesome."
My grand kids love the movie as much as their dad did
"Singing was fantastic 
Great characters"
"One of Disneys best remakes. A perfect blend of classic and new, the Little Mermaid is a must see!"
Absolutely loved it!!!!!
As usual nothing I didn't like about it I absolutely loved it
"A REVIEW OF THE LITTLE MERMAID  

We all know the story of Little Mermaid. This version follows the original animated film almost beat for beat with minor changes for the  live actions. 

Going to the cinema and seeing all the little black girls dress up as Mermaids was adorable. Even some of their mothers were dressed up too. The theater was packed. My wife had tears of joy as Ariel sang her first song. 

Halle Bailey is a star. Every second she was on screen was magic. Melissa Mccarthy ate every sceen she was in as Ursula. While this is not a perfect movie it is very enjoyable and easy to watch. The CGI on Sebastian, Flounder, and Scuttle are great. Sebastian played by Daveed Diggs has the funniest one-liners throughout the film. 

I hope everybody that was mad that a mythical imaginary creature, ie a Mermaid is Black, is punching air and crying over how much money this film is making. The representation in this film doesn't just stop with Halle Bailey, it goes throughout the entire cast. The film is a bit long and could have shaved 15 minutes off here and there. Plus there was a couple of unnecessary stipulations in Ursula's curse-spell that differ from the animated film for no logical reason but that's not making or breaking the film.

If you have little kids especially little girls, I highly recommend this film. Or if you're just feeling nostalgic and want to recapture your childhood go see this movie.

Grade:"
"I went to see Little Mermaid yesterday with my adult daughter. If you have not planned to go, stop what you are doing, look at available times in your movie theatre and get your butt there!!  It is fantastic!!  We both loved every single minute of it and I dare say I like it more than the original. (High praise from the girl who was 8 years old for the original release)."
"Absolutely beautiful movie, highly recommend. Wonderful actors and loved to see the diversity and wide range of representation throughout the whole film. Definitely must see, youll enjoy"
I loved how inclusivity was covered without explanation bc if you watch for the RIGHT reasons you just GET IT!!!  Beautiful!!
"Awesome cast, so much like the animated movie, sooooo awesome!"
This was a beautifully done remake of the little mermaid. We saw it in 3D which was great for the underwater visuals.
I loved Halle Bailey. This new rendition made women of color feel included in this under the sea classic.
I would suggest that children under 5 may find parts frighting. The colors were beautiful loved it
It was better than the original and the new kyrics and songs were a great idea and improvement - we loved it.
We loved the part when Ariel gets out of the carriage and starts walking through the shops.
Loved it! Stayed pretty close to the original. Halle and Melissa were phenomenal as Ariel and Ursula! Will be seeing it again!
Awesome cast! Awesome movie!
Wonderful.  Halle’s voice brought tears to my eyes.  Will see again.
Great graphics and fun for all all ages
My granddaughter loved it!
"Its a beautiful movie, everyone did a fantastic job.  My granddaughter loved it."
It represented everyone cultures and it showed a common bias that was generalized was turned around.
"The first thing my granddaughter said as the movie ended was  that was great, I have to see it again. So much better than the animation movie with more music. Excellent a must see."
Absolutely a PG movie.
Great movie. It's worth a watch.
Halle did an amazing job !! The whole cast was great love the message behind the movie ! I will be going to see it again.
Felt like I was genuinely under water.  Graphics were great!
Loved the movie. Halle Bailey did a great job.
This was a GREAT movie!
"Best live action interpretation yet! Ariel's voice was perfect, and she was so beautify. Ursula was iconic - Skuttle stole the show for sure lol."
The Little Mermaid  was very good. Disney did a great job in the remake.
"stunning and exceeded my expectations. messages and themes were well brought out, romance was well built up over time, and the music was phenomenal"
Hallie was the perfect Ariel.  Her voice is Amazing and I couldn't imagine anyone else in the role
Loved it!! Halle Bailey was born to be Ariel. The ending felt a bit rushed but otherwise a good movie.
Absolutely AMAZING!!!
Me and my family enjoyed the movie so much  the singing was so beautiful
"From the moment the original came out in 1989 my daughter was hooked at 2 years old! We both, along with her daughters, watched this movie. We all agree that it's the best animation to real life adaption we have EVER seen! Actor selection for roles were spot on! This is definitely a movie we will all purchase and rewatch for years to come!
A. MUST. SEE."
I love the movie the second time around
"I didn't like it. Songs were different,  ariel should of had red hair, there is a part of the movie she isn't supose to have a voice and they show her singing  I honestly didn't like it I expected something real pretty like the actual little mermaid."
"The Best movie since COVID, on tv or in theaters!!! The story behind it. The beautiful underworld, spectacular!! The voices of each character beautifully, wisely chosen, the singing took my breath away!!!!! This movie had the children in the movie laughing, giggling, clapping and cheering in the end. It warmed my heart even more. I took my nieces to see this movie but i myself thoroughly enjoyed it. Would go and see it again!!!"
"I really enjoyed the movie, the only thing I didn't like was sabastian  Jamaican accent  other than that the movie was beautiful"
"It was a good storyline. All the acting was superb. It was great seeing an african american in such an iconic, changing of character moment. I loved all the diversity of all races together as family."
"This movie was amazing, way better than the original!"
"It gave me the same feelings the original movie did, I found myself smiling and laughing at many moments of the movie. Definitely recommend"
My daughter like you
The live action honored the original. It was perfect
"Very entertaining. All 4 generations enjoyed it (95, 65, 42 and 9 years of age). Music, acting and scenery were captivating."
Awesome cinematography and great cast.
Great live action remake!...the songs brought back old memories. The acting was good too.
"Beautiful imagery, excellent singing voice of the actors in the roles of the Little Mermaid, Ursula, and Sebastian.  Enjoyed the comic relief of Sebastian and Scuttles."
"I absolutely loved it, Halle Bailey was awesome. I’m glad They stuck to the original storyline. A must see"
"Worse character arrangement in history,"
Movie was great the 5 kids loved it
Extremely talented lead actress!   Vocals were incredible.
The whole movie is great! But they tone downnthe zas of Ursula!
Absolutely amazing!!! Wonderful film! Incredible singing!! I also love that my children get to grow up during a time where we actually see diversity on screen!!!
"We really enjoyed it. As a huge fan of the original, I was a bit skeptical as to if the magic could be recreated in live action. However. I was pleasantly surprised. The musical renditions were wonderful, and the additions to the story complemented the film beautifully. Great film and phenomenal job done by the cast and everyone else involved."
The entire production was AMAZING!
I thought this was a great movie. The singing was wonderful. I was skeptical at first but I’m happy that I gave it a chance.
Not what I was Expecting.
It was cute and I liked Prince Erics song. But I didnt like the ending. I dont understand why every Disney movie needs to change the roles of who is being saved. I loved it the original way. The movie wasnt bad but it wasnt great. The love action Beauty and the Beast and Cinderella set the bar really high for love actions.
"Absolutely loved this movie. As an adult who adored it as a child,  this reimagining brought a tear to my eye multiple times. So well done!"
"Phenomenal cast, incredibly talented!
Disney knocked it out of the park with this remake.
The music was amazing and kept true to the original soundtrack.
I thoroughly enjoyed it and cant wait to see it again and again."
"Take a trip down in the ocean with your favorite mermaid, Ariel. Halle played great with this role and it definitely was a highlight. The musical numbers were a joy and such. Sometimes the pacing was a little slow but then intense scenes balanced that out. This live action remake was well made and I enjoyed my time!"
Wow surprised all my expectations of a Disney remake
"Made me cry throughout the whole movie! I saw one of my most beloved childhood movies put to life and with a lead that looks like me. I feel for me and other girls like me Hallie made us part of the world we are always excluded from. The music was excellent, the settings majestically, and overall I had a wonderful time"
"My family and I enjoyed the movie. Beautiful music, visually, great, and enjoy the storyline. Nice popcorn movie."
Nostalgia at its finest! The little mermaid is my favorite disney princess movie & this new real life version was all I ever imagined & more.
I rather enjoyed that
Meh. Just ok. Hard to get into it honestly after how amazing the original was. Also they left out the kitchen scene. One of my fave.
Loved the songs. Movie was very close to the original script.  My kids enjoyed the movie
"So good. I grew up on the original and I’ve loved it my entire life. I think this may be better then the OG 1989 film, which is crazy to say."
made me cry like a little kid again
I loved it it was so beautiful the ocean scenes were beautiful Disney always makes movies over the top
Very nostalgic even with some of the slight changes people are annoyingly complaining about. Halle Bailey killed it voice and all and the representation of so many cultures was it for me!
Loved everything it was perfect!!!!!!!
Loved the numbers and the scenery was gorgeous. Well done choice of musicality. Gripping.
"My daughter's enjoyed the whole movie. Definitely brought nostalgia and memories from the original cartoon version. I personally felt it was a tad too long but overall enjoyed it as well. Also missing one of my favorite parts, Sebastin vs the Chef in the kitchen and boat scenes."
I just hate so much singing .other wise it was nice
Excellent adaptation.  Close Bailey is the only person  for this roll.  Bravo!
"It was really good, a little long and some scary scenes for younger ones, but really a good movie"
It was epic!! Amazing!! Fantastic!!!!
Fun retelling of a Disney Classic! The music was amazing. Halle put on an amazing performance as Ariel. Her voice brought me to tears.
Everything was AMAZINGGG
Halle Bailey is a STAR- what a beautiful voice. She absolutely embodies Ariel. The movie was so fun and had me smiling through so many iconic moments! Just magical.
"The movie was amazing!! Ive been a little mermaid fan since a child and for old-time sake went to see the movie on my birthday. Since it is a live-action remake I expected certain elements to change, but honestly, it didnt disappoint. If you are willing to give a live-action Disney movie a chance let at least be The Little Mermaid."
Not bad for a live action.
I absolutely loved it!! The kids enjoyed every moment especially the extra scenes and songs! Disney did not disappoint us! And I so loved how the movie stick to the main script majority of the time.
Super super cute.. all the actors did a super great job.
"This movie was something else, what a beautiful reimagine and story! Fell deep into the siren spell of Hallie and will definitely see it again and again!"
It was a great movie!! I loved it!!!
The movie was quite like the anime version it an excellent movie I enjoyed it
"Just simply not as good as the original. I mean it had its moments, but it just simply didn’t stack up to the original. They were spot on with their choices with some of the characters, especially Halle Bailey as Ariel, but they just seemed to deviate from the script a bit."
Lovely movie and awesome scenery on a huge screen!
"I loved everything about the movie!!
No dislikes"
The movie was great despite the reviews. The only thing that was bad was the acting of king triton. Thru took some things out and added some new from the original but I enjoyed it
This was beautifully made and the new songs were amazing to hear as well as the old I was transported back to being a kid all over again except this time the little mermaid looked like me! Loved this!
There's not enough stars for this movie. I feel like this was the best Disney Live Action they've done so far. love the music love the graphics all around great movie
Amazing!!! 10 out of 10
Fun movie!! The best live action remake Disney has done!!
"I absolutely love the Little Mermaid. I thought they did a fantastic job and love all the diversity. The music was everything, and Halle's voice is out of this world. Job well done!!!!"
the acting was the worst I've seen from a Disney movie.  everything about it was literally painful to watch compared to the original.
"I really enjoyed it. The casting choice was well done. The actress for Ariel sounded like the cartoon original, and her voice was amazing. all of the original songs that were kept in the movie sounded just as good. very well done. I absolutely loved it."
"Overall great movie, looks great and loved the songs! 5/5 definitely recommend"
It was a bit boring and felt extremely long
I loved the movie! Brought me back childhood memories!
10/10 Movie!! Halle was
"Great movie, great graphics, great visuals and most importantly great vocals"
"I was shocked how much I like this movie . The remake was well done they knew to make this move their own, so it wasn't exactly like the original but very tasteful in how they executed the story .. well done 👏"
Amazing. Going to see again
Never seen the other little mermaids but this one met bare minimum expectations
Loved it Halle Bailey is amazing
My daughter and I love you. They did a great job!
Perfection from beginning to the end.
"Incredible! Beautiful colors, amazing voice and lovely plot. Halley was made for this role!"
Beautiful take on a classic movie
"Not great. Some very cringe moments especially the ones where the sentimentality is spread on way too thick. Eric doing a solo, eek. Ariels father popping his head out of the blue as theyre on their way to their new life together. Double eek. The one star is for Melissa McCarthys stellar turn as Medusa."
Overall it was great. Wife and daughter liked it a bit more than I did. Wasn’t a fan of the solo prince Eric song.
literally the best live action movie disney has ever done
"This was the most beautiful and amazing movie I’ve seen… Growing up wasn’t able to watch most of the Disney and animated movies, But how as an adult I’m playing catch and really don’t mind it… I have Nieces and Nephews and would love for them to experience it all… Love love love this movie. Definitely a must go WATCH 100%"
"Incredible film! The singing was immaculate, and I loved the twists on the old tale! 10 out of 10!"
Love everything about the movie!!!
The remake was unbelievably good.
Everything about this movie was just PERFECTION!
Great Movie Loved It ! Childhood Unlocked
"I love how this film proves us that anyone can be a mermaid and merman, no matter what color skin that person have. Its all about diversity for every minority groups. But more importantly, I love how they show positive representation for the Black community that never see themselves as merpeople before. Also, I love how they continue the storyline and still made it modern therefore, show us that Ariel did not left her kingdom and family for a man."
The songs sounded just like the original move. I love how they added some island culture to the movie. Absolutely love it.
Loved the movie from start to finish
It was a fresh telling of the story.  I loved the music and the increased role of Ursula!
"Halle Bailey was the perfect Ariel. This was the best live action remake, habds down."
"Cute, easy going flick! Loved the visuals and vocals!  Perfect for families or a cute date night"
the worst movie remake 😫..
LOVE LOVE LOVE! Would watch it over and over again. They should do a song along version!
"Great acting, good songs and a diverse cast"
"I truly enjoyed this movie. The evil plot could have been much longer but outside of that, Disney did a great job especially with the diversity of the movie.!"
"Extremely immersive world you could feel, CGI looked great, and the romantic storyline between Ariel and Eric was further developed. The portrayal of songs and characters was amazing. Definitely a must watch!"
The best live action Disney Movie to date! I got chills all throughout the movie! They couldn't have picked a better cast. Halle Bailey did AWESOME
a great film . the 4dx was so much fun.
"Enjoyed Halle as Ariel, not too fond of who played Sebastian. Overall it was still beautiful!!"
"Absolutely beautiful!!!! 
Slight changes but nothing to complain about. We loved it!!"
Seeing Part of Your World on the IMAX screen made me weep. I had goosebumps. This movie is so beautifully made. Well worth the wait.
Everything about the movie was beautiful!
THE BEST LIVE ACTION DISNEY MOVIE 🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾
The movie was awesome! I could imagine it in 3D it was so cool and great I loved the quality underwater in the movie it is so beautiful I recommend 3D that would be way better but regular will be fine. -Aria 9 years old
Definitely a good watch. So much cooler in 3D. Probably even better in 3D and IMAX. Definitely a good movie with tones of laughs and super cool effects.
I didn’t have much hope for this movie but I was wrong I ABSOLUTELY loved it definitely worth the trip to the movies!
Loved Hailey Bailey Singing and acting.
I love that they didnt change much from the OG.
The acting was outstanding! Scenery and special effects were beyond my expectations!
I have been following this since Halle was casted. I really loved the outcome and the attention to detail. Im a hairstylist and really was captivated by her hair! Love the new songs and ending! Beautiful job well done
"The sound track is great Melissa, Halle, Daveed, Jonah and Awkwafina did a great job. Some of the CGI could have been better under the water. Overall, it is a film I will continue to love. The new songs were awesome!"
"The best Disney remake I've seen since Aladdin. Sebastian and Scuttle brought the laughs while Ariel and Eric brought the charm. The visuals may be a bit dodgy, but they're still beautiful."
Disney did right by this live version of the The Little Mermaid. Halle Bailey was the perfect Ariel! My 1.5 year old daughter was tuned in up until the very end! I would definitely watch it in theaters again! 10/10 highly recommend
My daughter and I enjoyed the movie. She sang all of the songs and just loved it. I find that the critics like to pick on movies but as a non-expert reviewer I can just say this. We had a great time and really enjoyed it!
The graphics and the music were everything! Great job to the entire cast and crew!
Loved itt can’t wait to rewatch tomorrow 😩
I loved everything about this movie!! 10/10 Highly recommend!
"I loved the mix of animation and live actors.  Don't know how they taped so many of the scenes, how actors were talking and their hair was floating around them like they were underwater.  The girl who played Ariel had an amazing voice, all the music was awesome.  There is nothing that I didn't like about it.  It was the usual high quality Disney movie.  Loved it!!"
"A beautiful cast for a brilliant, Disney classic that retains the magic the original had."
We loved it! It was a great movie!
So inspiring and refreshing. My daughters loved it.
Loved it! All the songs had me singing along and reminiscing.
"Great for the kids. Gave Ariel more agency from the original. There is more chemistry between Ariel and Eric, the songs are amazing. The chef is missing but I truly loved the movie."
"Iconic,masterpiece,beautiful,amazing"
The movie was Amazing!! I love the music and the diversity!!
Keep my attention the entire time. Followed original story. Done very beautiful.
Amazing amazing movie
The actors were great. I  just love Melissa McCarthy and Halle Bailey.  Wonderful show. I would love to see more movied like this
The movie was amazing! If it receives any negative comments. Its not about the content.
"We absolutely loved it, even my teenager who wasn't that excited about it! You always worry when you have such a beloved movie with iconic songs but y'all, that Halle can SING!! Her version of Part of Your World was phenomenal and Under the Sea was a BANGER. So much fun and Jonah was a great pic for Prince Eric and didn't hurt that he's a smoke show! 🤣"
Hailey Bailey is a star! Hope this movie opens all the doors for her.
"We really enjoyed the movie!! So fun to see the live version take on it missed a few fun details, but overall it was fantastic!"
"It was a fantastic movie!! The cast and crew did an outstanding job! I sang along, cried, and thoroughly enjoyed everything about the movie! Id see it again in a heartbeat! Well done and perfect adaptation of the original movie!"
Amazing!!!!!! I cried the whole movie.
"Great movie, Very well worth it."
"I love the singing the costumes the special effects. 
Well done. 
My 5 year old Granddaughter loved it."
Just beautifully done.
"Disney could not have casted a better Ariel. Halle’s speaking and singing voice we’re spot on and her performance was next level. I shed a couple of tears throughout the film (opening song for sure) because I was just in awe. Despite the turmoil, hatred, and bigotry, she shined in this role💞💞💞"
"Wonderful picture-music, story, touching, effects-it has it all!"
"Halle Bailey i’m so proud of you… I laughed, I cried, I smiled, I sang. Halle was so adorable the whole movie😭The romance between her & Eric was so cute, Melissa Mccarthy kinda mother she chewed as Ursula omg! Jess Alexander ate as Vanessa! 10/10. classic. #MyLittleMermaid #gagged #mother 🧜🏽‍♀️"
Me and my family loved the whole movie
"Took my teenage granddaughter to see it with me, and we both loved it.  I did laugh with Eric's song though    Halle Bailey is beautiful with a beautiful voice"
"Great job by all the cast!!! But of course, Melissa McCarthy steals the show!"
Loved it!!! Music  and visuals were so wonderful!!
"Loved everything about this movie,excellent movie,I would go and see it again."
Such a great movie!!! All the actors did an awesome job!!!
The movie if fantastic! The cast is great and the visuals are amazing! It is definitely a must see!!
This was awesome! Love the special affects! Ariel was beautiful.. changed up the songs a bit but I got used to it new songs added.. but the sea witch my favorite!! Great job Disney! I loved the cartoon and love the movie!
Halle Bailey did an excellent job portraying Ariel. And her voice is phenomenal. Can’t wait to see it again!
"It was great, some moments could have been better and Tritan could have been better built, but it was humbling."
The movies was awesome. The singing was beautiful. The whole cast did a wonderful. I think every lil girl or boy should go and see this movie. definitely 5 stars
The movies had great cinema.
"This movie was very good! They put in new touches, as I was hoping. I think it was better than the original, more realistic."
"The Little Mermaid was a fun watch. It does the original justice while bringing a new vibe. Halle Bailey was incredible as Ariel. I’d give it a 5 star but it didn’t bring enough originality however, how much originality can you bring to an almost shot for shot remake? Would recommend it to any fan of the original The Little Mermaid or any Disney enthusiasts."
"I was 4 in 1989, and I couldnt be happier with how well they adapted it. Halle Baileys a literal living siren, wonderful emotive performance, great chemistry among the actors, well acted, funny, sweet, and utterly beautiful underwater visuals. Loved it."
Awesome movie! My daughters loved it!!!! Best movie I’ve seen in a long time!
"Outstanding Movie! The graphics and acting were phenomenal. Also loved the diverse cast.  Very good movie, recommended for both kids and adults."
I was skeptical about this live action but ended up being pleasantly surprised. Must see!  Ursula stole the show!
Amazing performances by everyone involved! Beautifully done and the addition of Aquafina to the cast as Scuttle was perfect-
"I really liked it a lot and I was even moved when the necklace broke and Ariel recovered her voice. It wasn't great, but very acceptable. I give it an 8.5/10"
"Just saw The Little Mermaid  on IMAX and it was amazing!!! The casting, the music, the special effects, the plot alignment with the original movie. Just a few twists and moderations, but wow the musical numbers and vocals  and Sebastians character was probably my favorite"
"The movie was amazing, loved it"
Absolutely PHENOMENAL
Amazing! The right combination of nostalgia and new storytelling. Will go see again. Its the NEW classic!
"A joy. I accept that Disney is doing their best to make changes and it obviously will come with a lot of backlash but Ariel at all being a woman of color is still amazing to me. If you are not one of us fantasy obsessed black kids (now black adults) you could never understand how important this film is. Or how important it will be for the future black fantasy kids, or actors or singers or dancers who one day would like to land coveted and sought after roles."
We loved it! Better than the animation
"Was very well done!!
 Halle Bailey was amazing! Melissa McCarthy was fantastic! Javier Bardem amazing, very well done"
I love the movie my inner child cried ...
True to the original movies storyline. There is new music and the cast is very diverse like the real world. Great job Disney!
"The movie was great! Loved the songs, the humor from scuttle and Melissa Mcarthy as Ursula was great! Was a bit long for my three children under 7 but we all still enjoyed it!"
The movie was great! It kept the attention of my 3 year old granddaughter
Great movie we really enjoyed!
"The live action was beautiful, the movie could have gone without that cgi monster at the end but overall it was good."
ne and my daughter loved it. the only thing is I was missing the red hair..
Sebastian had me laughing throughout the whole movie. Such a good film!
a great watch..the whole loved it. would definitely rewatch it
It was meh. I saw the standard showing and the image quality wasn’t what I was expecting. Feel like it may have been better in XD or similar.
It was a great movie for the whole family to watch. I took my grands. They enjoyed it. The movie was action packed  and the story line was easy to follow.
Loved everything. It was amazing costumes and scenery.
The beginning was a little boring but it turn into an amazing movie! Of course the original is better but we all know that!  is still favorite and I will watch again
What an amazing movie!! LOVED IT afrontar the beginning to the end!!!!!!! Spectacular!!!
10/10 it was SAUR GOOD
I would definitely take my family back to see this movie over again. The whole cast did a wonderful job! I was very pleased that they didn't change the story from the original. Halle Bailey is a STAR with a voice of an angel.
The absolute BEST live remake of a Disney movie to date
Mermazing!  🧜‍♀️My new favorite live action film! 🩵
"Ithe movie was an excellent well
Thought Out movie we loved it   It had character, a plot and guess what.. it wasnt animated 
We loved it !"
I loved it! Very nostalgic! Glad I got to share this with my daughter! Could’ve done without prince Eric’s song though lol
"Overall a good movie.  Didn't hold my attention in some scenes, songs/singing went well, i would watch it again."
I love love love this movie Halle Bailey really really nailed this movie
Excellent.  stayed true to the original.  I loved the new songs.. Melissa was awesome!!! Hallie did an amazing job.  it was Excellent!! great job Disney!
I loved every minute of it
It was a beautiful remake for the new generation. Beautiful job Halle🤎🤎🤎🤎🤎🤎🤎🤎🤎🤎🤎
"Saw with my four year old granddaughter. Great singing and acting. Memorable set pieces. Puzzled by dark, faded palette and over long running time. 2 hours 15 minutes

Ursula scared her"
This movie is a masterpiece!💜
"the movie was amazing. One of the best disney live actions we’ve had. the acting, costumes and humor was soooo good. Halle Bailey did her thing!"
noticed several differences but overall pretty good. Granddaughter enjoyed
Movie was fun. Loved the new Ariel. Granddaughters were overjoyed! Visual were fantastic.
"I loved the visuals in 3-D! I loved the diverse cast and the storyline. Though we all differ in many ways, we have more in common and love prevails! Halle Bailey was exceptionally wonderful as Ariel! One People. One Love."
My daughter and i watched this today. I thought the movie was fabulous! I really enjoyed the different actors and the message in the end. Much different from the animated version. I absolutely loved it!
Loved it. I music was great. Love Halle Bailey and Melissa McCarthy. I even love the actor who plays Eric.
Absolutely loved everything about this movie!
Movie was excellent.  Great cast and movie.  Highly recommend.
"One of Disney's best live action remakes!  It was better than the original animated version!
A MUST WATCH!!!!!"
We loved this movie. It very much followed the original movie. The graphics were awesome esp during the fight with Ursula at the end. The actors were amazing. I would go see this again.
So amazing and beautiful. Thank you for this masterpiece.  I also loved the new songs and cried at the end.
"Great story, amazing characters"
Great movie my lady and I enjoyed.
Hailey definitely has star power and this will serve as a spring board for her. however the film itself was overly long for kids. the new songs were lackluster and the humor was flat. yet another underwhelming live action remake from disney
Absolutely loved it! Complete nostalgic moment for me to share with my children!
Loved Hallie Bailey. Beautiful love story
"The fact that Disney is re-imagining these classical movies with diverse cast aiding the inclusion and the storyline made me fall into my childhood fantasy as a mermaid, but this I could be the mermaid as a woman of color."
This movie will exceed every expectation you have for it. It is a MUST SEE. I want to watch this movie a thousand more times. The best Disney princess live action movie by far
My girls loved the details of the mermaids !!!!
"I turned 34 with this movie this year—grew up singing the songs in this film, had a Flounder stuffed animal  please believe me when I say that the film was worth every cent for this true blue Little Mermaid fan. If you love the '89 film and Disney in general, you will undoubtedly appreciate this live action rendition of it. I know some folx can't get past Flounder's eyes  but I loved it. 9/10. (I never give 10/10s, perfection is a construct.)"
amazing re-imagining
"wether this film makes a billion or not, it is still the best live action movie Disney has ever actually done justice (it deserves to make a billion). Also can we talk about how hot Prince Eric is?"
"As someone who remembered the animated film when I was a child, it was wonderful seeing the creative art direction with this modern live action movie. The actors and actresses were really good. Very impressed with the person playing Ariel who did an excellent job! Overall the film was way better than I thought. I enjoyed it so much. Really loved the film and the message it conveys, especially the ending. Great family film. Appears a lot of thought and care went into making this movie. Visuals were really beautiful. One of the best live action Disney films ever made, along with Aladdin. In fact I give the “Little Mermaid” a solid 10 and a huge thumbs up. It’s that good!"
There was nothing to dislike about this beautiful creation of art! Im so proud of Disney! Great way to step up & show diversity!! I will forever & akwTs be a fan
Great movie for the whole family! Melissa McCarthy was pitch perfect as Ursula!
"I laughed,  cried. and giggled.  All the cast members did an amazing job. Will see it again."
I loved this movie. The music and singing. The bright colors and snappy effects. The emotionalism. It was a tear jerker! I came in distracted by the fake negative reviews and came out happy and light as a feather.
I loved it! I grew up loving The Little Mermaid and this version was so good. I do think the live actions are better for adults as the 5 year old we had had trouble keeping her attention without the cartoon but I absolutely loved it!
It was an excellent version and Halle Bailey was a wonderful Ariel.  Prince Eric as had more depth than before and Melissa McCarthy was a great Ursula.  The diversity within the very welcomed
SOOOOOO GOOOD! INSTANT CLASSIC once again!!!!
"True to the original, which was my favorite. Great movie! I teared up multiple times! Halle was perfect, so was Sebastian and Scuttle- really, the whole cast was great!"
Family Friendly movie!
Stayed true to the original but added some twists. The music was amazing ! Her voice is just beautiful!
The movie provided the dynamics the original has. It was rich in color and dialogue. The added pieces that made the movie run pass its original run time were not necessary but certainly change the tone of the movie. Over all I enjoyed it.
It’s was my favorite childhood movie
"It’s Good, Songs we’re great . Story line was same of original . It was bit predictable .. But all in all my 4 yrs daughter like it since it was first time she watched."
"Beautiful story with a little suspense, action, romance, and drama. Enjoyable"
Melissa McCarthy is insane as Ursula. Loved watching Poor Unfortunate Souls. As for the Ariel. She's a fictional character and can be any race as its important to her character. Halle Bailey is great as well. Fun ride.
Awesome. Loved it. The look on my grand daughters face as i watched was priceless.
"I liked the movie a lot.  

The only dislike was for the parent who let their 2 kids (approx 2&3) run all over the theater and being loud."
Enchanting! Halle Bailey is Ariel! Jonah Hauer-King shines as Prince Eric! Every character was a joy to watch. If you love the original you are going to love this. If you’re sick of Disney live action remakes and are going to let that cloud your judgment then just don’t watch. I have nothing bad to say about this movie and I can’t wait until it’s out on Disney+!
I loved the singing and I loved that Halle Bailey played Ariel really well!!
I love how the whole plot was the same as the original and was not changed. It was really good!
"Halley was perfect !
This movie was awesome"
"Love it. Halle Bailey was excellent. Neptune and Melissa were great. I love the music and the beautiful sister' mermaids. Very colorful.  So good, I really enjoyed it."
Awesome as good as original
"It was truly an awesome experience. The film beautifully brought the enchanting underwater world to life with its stunning visuals and vibrant colors. The cast delivered fantastic performances, bringing life into the beloved characters and making them feel relatable. The music was simply enchanting, staying true to the iconic songs while adding a fresh twist. Overall, ""The Little Mermaid"" live-action adaptation was a delightful and captivating cinematic journey that did justice to the classic tale."
Beautiful and Inspiring
Great movie! Would definitely watch again
"Beautiful movie. Give it a chance, you will enjoy"
"We Didnt like it when Ursula  put her finger in the skull eye 
We liked the little mermaid singing"
Zero complaints! Super cute and such a diverse cast!
A GREAT modern new version on a beloved film! Some remakes aren't as good as the original BUT this one was GREAT!! I would see it again....and again... and again!!!
It was SO SO good! It was so beautiful and vibrant and everyone ate their roles. Please go see it!
I liked the diversity of people in the show.  The vocals were unbelievably beautiful
"Wonderfully made, love the fact that there was no hidden adult jokes or questionable relationships that werent there before. It was just a great girl movie! It brought me back to the original!"
"I enjoyed the film, took me back to my childhood. Was able to sing songs from the original score and felt like I was watching the animation again. Remake well done."
disappointed in the accent of the crab. a real Caribbean should have been chosen for the voice. everything else was fine
I LOVED the market scene.
"The excellent movie, the lousy movie theater, dirty and did not have air conditioning"
"Marvelous score and lyrics, original and new. Great 3D."
Wry cute movie. The acting was super! My grandchildren loved the movie!
"Amazing visuals, overall such a beautiful film"
Great movie. loved all the vibrant colors and scenes. great job. loved the singing and each actor and actress did amazing
Wonderful love action remake of a childhood classic. We all loved it!
halle was born to play this role !!!!
Great to see a multicultural cast and loved the songs.
We brought our 5 year old son and he couldn’t sit still. Didn’t keep his attention. As a fan of the original movie this was good. It had some funny scenes just missed the mark on being great.
I actually thought it was fantastic but it was missing the kiss
"My expectations of Disney have been pretty low over the last few years due to their need to be woke on everything. Since the little mermaid was my absolute favorite movie as a child, I decided this would be worth trying. I was so pleasantly surprised and impressed! The characters stayed true to the story line and the small tweaks to the plot made sense. They did an excellent job with this film!"
I loved this movie!🤗
The movie was awesome. Very excellent.love all the characters
A fresh new retelling of the classic.
Loved the new songs & the diversity displayed was astounding!
so much better than I anticipated...nostalgic and new both at the same time
"Great animation, great music. Good balance if songs from the original and new ones. A little bit scary for small children, script seemed a bit overwritten at times."
Loved it. I would definitely see it again everyone on the theater clapped at the end. I very much enjoyed it. Tear came down at the end big thumbs up.
"Subpar acting, no type of connection between characters left lacking"
Awesome remake of the original with a little extra Umph! Whistles and clapping in my theater! Hubby and I made seeing this a date night and I went home singing Little Mermaid lyrics.. Its a must see..
"Excellent movie, Halle was amazing from start to finish, music, color, and animation was   awesome."
"I liked that it was a family movie, that there was a little twist to the normal princess type shows, and the adventure was great!"
LOVED IT! It did the original justice and put a slight modern day twist on it. Halle was perfect and Prince Eric wasnt too hard on the eyes either!
A little scary in places for younger children.
I enjoyed it and will watch it again. Excellent job!!
The movie was good. I liked that it stayed true to the original with just minimal changes. I don’t think that the 3D added anything to the movie
Best live action Disney movie yet!
It was good but it's not like the cartoons that I grow up with. Good for kids my niece enjoy it and love it.
"This movie was amazing! The cast is amazing, the music and songs are beautiful, the scenes are gorgeous. It hit all of the nostalgic points of the animated version but it was so easy to feel the emotions with the characters in this version. It was fun, emotional, and captivating!"
Movie was Great me and my daughter enjoyed it a lot . The prices of the tickets however was a little over priced.
Wonderful movie! Halle playing Ariel was terrific. She had the perfect princess voice.
"This is a Great Movie, a must see in 3D"
Absolutely amazing! Love every moment of this movie and gave me childhood memories of watching this as a little girl. Love seeing the representation shown in Ariel Im a BIG fan! 10/10 highly recommend
This movie was the most beautiful experience I have ever endured. I love that it mostly stayed true to the original with a couple of new AMAZING songs. Everyone giving it negative reviews is simply hating and doesn't know good cinema. Great job to the entire cast. This film was magic on a screen.
The movie was amazing. I really enjoyed seeing the characters bring the story to life. This is my daughters new favorite movie.
A classic retold for our generation.
What a movie!! A must see.
"Had to get a refund the constant screaming along with my chair being continuously kicked was a major setback. I get it it’s a family movie, but parents should show their kids what respect looks like I wanted to enjoy the movie hopefully when I see you at 10:30 Monday night it’ll be a better experience and a different experience at that"
I love the mermaid I feel that it completed the story.
The movie was awesome do much action it felt like I was in the movie
Love the movie!!!! But we  didnt see a backdrop to take photos with my daughters after the show.
The singing was phenomenal. the acting was great. she did a great job as Ariel. I love the whole movie
So beautiful and highly recommend seeing it in 3D
Beautiful singing - well made film - grandkids and grandparents enjoyed!!
"I'm not going to lie. I went into this movie with low expectations but was definitely surprised. it was beautifully shot, and Halle was fantastic. The fact that it kept my 3 year old's attention is enough reason to give it 5 stars."
"We loved it and thought they did a great job explaining a bit more about the historical context of the island and Eric's background. 
Everyone did a spectacular job in their roles, especially Melissa McCarthy as Ursela. Easily one of my favorite scenes was Unfortunate Souls! 
Some spots felt rushed, but overall we really enjoyed it!"
"I was really disappointed with this movie. As a fan of the original Little Mermaid since I was a child there differences were too many. The added songs were unnecessary, the changing words of some songs was unnecessary and some stuff was left out, like the chefs song and Vanessas song. Also, flounder wasnt in the movie as much as he originally was. Overall I was disappointed. I would not see it again and I will not be purchasing it on dvd."
The new remake has a more meaningful direction of where Ariel is and where she is going. It also shows why some mermaids do not like humans. Everything that was lacking in the original is present in the remake.  Halle Bailey was PERFECT and AMAZING as Ariel! This is now my only favorite movie
"I was excited to see this movie and it did not disappoint. The visuals were great, of course the storyline was great and stuck very close to the original. The characters were funny, music was wonderful and it even brought a tear to my eye, just like the original. Wonderfully done!!!"
Nice victuals but Stick with the original
"if I could leave a 10/10 I would, this movie was amazing !!"
"New songs werent a grand, they gave a new feel to the movie but removed that nostalgic feel so it constantly felt back and forth in the movie. They added some new things that were great, jokes were wonderful but some things were removed that really made the original, (Like Ursulas song) and it just kinda made it feel more off and less of a reason for the things Ariel wanted. Halle did amazing with the singing, her acting was good. Melissa was to die for! She killed it as Ursula."
Halle Bailey is so beautiful and her amazing voice and emoting was perfect. Love love love.
Its a must see! I loved everything about it. Halle was the perfect mermaid. Would definitely see it again!
It was okay but not to watch again…it was decent but I stay with the original one
Enjoyed seeing the vibrant colors of fish under the sea. Great story and the diversity shown was outstanding. Bravo Disney!
We loved the ending so heartfelt.
"The singing was great, loved the new lyrics."
Great movie for the family. I love the way they they incorporated different diversities
The best movie experience in 2023. Bautiful story and Amazing Cast. i'll definitely will recommend this movie.
AMAZING! perfectly like the original
It was long and boring
Fantastic adaptation! I thought it was so well done. The new songs are wonderful and not overdone. I think the actress playing Ariel did a fantastic job playing the naivety of Ariel and her voice was solid!
Exceeded my expectations.
Acting was great. Singing was fabulous.
"I went in with negative thoughts and left the cinema with joy & amazed at the film. Its a great family movie, definitely recommend."
"I didnt get to watch it through fandango due to computer glitch but I have to get my review in. HALLE BAILEY NAILED THIS & INCLUDING CAST & PRODUCTION! As I looked around I, it was clear all ages, sex & races thoroughly enjoyed this make on The Little Mermaid. A must see! I will see it AGAIN & maybe AGAIN!"
Superb! Best Ariel Ever!!!!!
Absolutely AMAZING!!!!!!!
"Beautifully done! The rhythmic music. The vivid colors. The message. All well received from our family that includes two sons, ages 12 and 15, the latter of whom was embarrassed to go. It was satisfying to see that he was not the only teen male there and to watch him smile and move to the music. The main male character doesnt have the best singing voice. The only suggestion is to consider kids ages, as the little ones under five seem to need several breaks. The movie is long and there are tons of previews We look forward to seeing in again once it is available on Disney plus. Enjoy!"
"This reimagining is so good! I loved every minute. Sebastians shaky accent and the new Scuttle song aside, this is the best remake yet!"
A slight remix from the original and it was great to see the representation
"Perfectly enjoyable. You can easily nitpick this movie to death and of course its not the original, but it is serviceable and inoffensive. Its fine and is enjoyable for what it is."
So many unexpected moments in this movie.  The diversity of the entire cast made this film relatable to all.  Enjoyed everything about this remake.
Its a bit too long for kids
"Nothing to dislike about the movie.  It was fantastic from beginning to end.  Although, Ursula may be a little scary for children."
Just awesome!  Even some of the dads were brought to tears.
"I loved this movie and wasn't expecting to. Halle's singing was amazing and it may be Melissa McCarthy's best acting ever and her performance of Poor Unfortunate Souls was delicious. Daveed Diggs, Akwafina, and Javier Bardem were all terrific."
"Phenomenal movie from start to finish ! Must See! 5 stars! 10/10! The sound track, the story, the casting, the colors. Everything. Cant wait to watch it again"
I loved it!!! Excellent Job Disney!
My daughter enjoyed it from the beginning to the end.  She sang along with the songs.  It's the first movie she stayed awake for the whole thing.
It was absolutely amazing
The effects were fabulous! Thoroughly enjoyed it - went with a 3.5 and 7 year old who sat through it without complaining. Loved loved Melissa McCarthy as Ursula.
Loved it! Perfect nostalgia with updates. Loved the actors/casting- everyone was perfect. Loved the music. The 3D under the sea was so fun. I have nothing I didnt love. Loved the cameo of the original little mermaid as well. Thanks!
The Little Mermaid  was everything we thought it would be and More!!!
Could’ve been better
Probably watched the original Little Mermaid at least a 100 times. GIRLDADX5 and Actually liked this version better.
Beautifully done! Did not disappoint.
"Loved it, very miracle. Thanks for bringing the cartoon to life. It a must go see.  A++"
The whole movie was outstanding!!
"The most accurate remake that Disney has made. Very identical to the original film. Everyone's singing is phenomenal, especially Halle Bailey. She IS Ariel without a doubt."
Halle is a star. Her beauty and voice jumped through the screen as much as her acting did. She was absolutely perfect and did a fantastic job. The whole movie was great and I’ll definitely see it again.
Exceeded my expectations. Well done.
The story and songs  are fantastic.
I couldn’t even see the movie. The seat where taken after I pay for reservation for those seat and still haven’t been able to get a refund back.
"It was an amazing show, well put together, and the theatre was incredible"
I loved it!! Can’t wait to see it again!!
Wonderful story line as only Disney can.nn
"The Little Mermaid is fabulous. My favorite characters were Javier Bardem and Melissa McCarthy. Halle’s voice is absolutely incredible. Her and Eric are really good together. All the songs were amazing. Especially the new Lin Manuel one. 
The entire movie was perfect. I’ve seen it twice so far! 
Fantastic film!"
"Loved it, the Caribbean theme, the new music, Halle Bailey (a star is born). It was beautifully done!!"
Kinda bad to be real
"My daughter, her bff, and I really enjoyed the movie! It’s a must see!! Love Halle Bailey❤️Melissa McCarthy played Ursula very well."
I loved the movie it was funny and beautiful. Halle did an excellent job and I loved how diverse the movie was as a whole
"Halle Bailey's performance brought tears to my family's eyes - and mine, too! The movie was above average among Disney's live action remakes, and I enjoyed it very much."
I absolutely love the little mermaid and this movie was amazing. of course it isn't exactly identical but it was its own and I enjoyed it and cries
soooo cute! loved it
"Beautiful visuals! Halle Bailey was a star and is so captivating throughout. Really enjoyed the updated Under the Sea! My only critique is that the movie truly is too dark in some scenes. I could hardly make out details in certain sequences. But despite this, the movie is a 10/10."
"It liked that it was the same as the original, just live actors.  The music was very good and I loved the under ocean scenes"
It was a great movie.  I liked it better than the other live action remakes of Disney animated movies.
The whole family loved it!
DEFINITELY RECOMMEND!!!!
Absolutely loved it! Was skeptical only because it's my favorite Disney movie since I was a kid and some of the other live action movies aren't great but this exceeded my expectation in every way. Even my teenage son who I practically begged to go (so I didn't have to go alone )said he really enjoyed it so that's saying something
I've waited my entire life for this live action. I was amazing
Someone pulled the fire alarm we got kicked out
VIsually wonderful and a fun afternoon spent with great characters and great music.
The acting and singing was great! I loved it
"Really enjoyed the movie, very heartwarming, I enjoyed the new songs, which brought the story together, and the movie paid very good homage to the original animated movie. Loved it."
I enjoyed the movie. A few things I would change but overall it was a good movie
"Beautifully made movie for all ages! Loved, loved the diversity! Thanks, Disney!"
Halle and Melissa are fantastic!!
"The animations, the music and the actors were all phenomenal"
Graphics are amazing!! Great movie 😊
"Delightful,captivating and splendid,though it could have cut a little time off it’s over 2+ hour runtime,The Little Mermaid(2023) is one of,if not the best of Disney’s live-action retellings.From the performances(Especially from Halle Bailey (Ariel) ,Melissa McCarthy (Ursula),Daveed Diggs (Sebastian),Jacob Tremblay (Flounder),Awkwafina (Skuttle),Jonah Hauer-King (Prince Eric),Javier Bardem(King Triton) among many) to the musical sequences(sans for one particular rap that was added in😒)to the musical score(from both the returning/legendary Alan Menken joined by the great Lin-Manuel Miranda) to the wonderful visuals to even a certain little cameo😉,you will be forever grateful to have been part of this world,even if it will not fully change your opinion of the 1989 original,same for me.Get ready for a wonderful/amazing journey under the sea!🧜‍♀️🐠🦀🔱"
"A wonderful love letter to the original that fleshes out the world of the Little Mermaid beautifully. Melissa McCarthy was wonderful as Ursula and brought a fun energy to the character. My only gripe is she didnt laugh enough! But when she did it was perfect. Halley Bailey was perfection as Ariel, her voice I enchanting her performance was just outstanding. This is a must see for new and old Little Mermaid fans alike."
Beautiful movie. I’ll be back to see it again!
"I really liked the representation that Halle Bailey portrayed. And all the other actors and actresses. Love the cinematography of the whole movie, it is as really colourful and vibrant!!! The plot made sense and the ending was fitting. It connected really well towards the original one. Jonah as prince Eric blew me away. Simone Ashley as Indira was just drop dead gorgeous, along with all the daughters of Triton. Sebastian, Flounder and Scuttle were comical to say the least (I had a good laugh) and to sum it up, The Little Mermaid is not some woke movie that haters love to say, it’s honourable representation, beautiful music, talented acting and good quality visuals that will have you amazed. Halle Bailey has truly become one of my fav actresses of all time and I think she’s onto the hall of fame and many accolades such as a Grammy, Oscar and Academy. Also I noticed Jodi Benson who voiced Ariel in the animated version and it was a breath of fresh air to see her. Only one thing annoyed me well not annoyed but was sad to me is the lack of scenes of the sisters, really would’ve been nice to see more of them and more of Atlantica. Highly recommend this movie be watched by anyone an any age and you’ll be moved and happy once it over. It’s a classic reimagined in the BEST way!!! 3"
I really loved this movie. I love how it was true to the original.
Beautifully written. Perfect adaptation of the original.
"Such a beautiful Disney movie, saw in 3D and it was the absolute best"
This movie was amazing and funny!!! I loved it!
EXCELLENT FROM BEGINNING TO END! I LOVED IT! 110%!
Excellent! You must take your tribe to see this film!
Loved it!  A couple scenes may be a little too scary for really young ones. The main character had an incredible voice.
I love it. Definitely healed my inner child
Amazing! She is the perfect Mermaid
Good movie for kids.
Loved every moment of it.
"Amazing voice, Halle rocks! The entire cast did a great job. I loved the movie. I laughed and cried. I celebrated with the youth in the audience clapping and cheering on Ariel. Loved Sebastian and Scuttle song."
This was a great movie and I love seeing the diversity in the movie and in the movie theater. It shows that children are just loving humans.
The visuals and how they brought everything to life. Halle Bailey did a phenomenal job and has a beautiful voice.
They did a great job recreating this movie. ABSOLUTELY AMAZING  😍...
We saw it in 3D definitely recommend it!
"Pretty good movie, watched it with my gf. If you love disney you will love this movie."
Overall very good movie. The vibrance of the colors and the amazing special effects were incredible. The classic songs were in the movie which I enjoyed with some new songs as well. A great modern day live version to the classic original.
"It was a beautiful movie. The colors, depictions and characters were all better than I could have imagined. I definitely recommend seeing it in 3D."
Not much changed from the cartoon. But I loved this and my 4 year olds loved it as well
My family and I loved the new Little Mermaid. It had some familiar things but had a great new twist. It was good and we will be seeing it again.
Loved this movie. Longer than expected but worth the ending.
Our family loved it!! The whole cast was spectacular!!!
"Very inclusive, like todays world"
"I was surprised at how much I did like it.  The acting was great, the cast worked but it just wasnt the same."
It followed very closely to the original movie but it was definitely modernized a bit with current personalities. It was a bit “ dark” in some scenes and may be a little frightening to very young children. But as an adult that grew up loving Disney Princesses….it’s a hit!
Better than the original!!!
Loved it! I didn't think that I would but I absolutely loved it!
Loved 😍 the little mermaid.  They all did a wonderful job.
"Honestly it was probably more fun to watch than the original. The music was amazing, the little animated characters were very funny and fun to watch, the story was easy to follow and two hours did not feel like enough time because it made you want even more. I recommend it to everyone even those who are skeptical, I promise you will come out loving it"
I loved the movie. The water scenes were a little dark. The little changes did not take away from the story at all. And Melissa McCarthy did excellent as Ursula!
"Very well done, the characters very diverse which showed the true meaning of love with a balance of a touch of evil."
I really enjoyed the animation coming to life and the storyline. It is a must see for all ages...teaches parents to listen more to their children rather than imposing their views on them.
The whole movie was wonderful
"Loved the movie. A nostalgic, romantic musical. Halle’s high note bust the movie theatre speakers. The entire cast did a great job. Disney always has hidden messages. Overall a great experience, especially in IMAX. My inner child is happy!"
"The drama of the movie was not engaging, if your child is 6 yrs or younger not a good movie. Wait until you can see it at home."
Melissa McCarthy was an excellent Ursula.
Instantly transported me to my childhood. Loved everything!! (except Flounder was the wrong shade of yellow!)
"Normally I avoid these “children’s” movies for obvious reasons however, I truly wanted to support this film with such a Fantastic Cast! Boy I’m Glad I did - it’s a Remarkable & Very Entertaining Movie with Great Musical Numbers by the Phenomenon, Halle Bailey! Melissa McCarthy plays the Sea Witch to Perfection!👍🏽🙌🏾👏🏽"
I thought they stayed pretty true to the original. A few changes and added songs. Each character played a great part. I thought Ariel and Sebastian were great. Great movie
"Movie was good , but . . . SOUND WAS TOO LOUD FOR MY ACCOMPANYING LITTLE ONE."
It was a great movie my daughters and I loved it
They kept the story the same as the original! We loved it Chloe was an amazing Ariel!
Excellent movie. Loved everything about it.
Great family and solo movie!!! Would definitely watch again!!
The underwater scenes were realistic! They did an amazing job with the 3D and color scheme! Halle Baileys voice was extraordinary!
"absolutely LOVED this movie...
visually STUNNING..."
"I would give it 10 stars if I could. A wonderful remake of the Disney Classic. I sang along and recited lines like I was 5 again. I love how they made it multicultural unlike the orginal cartoon version. My daughter loved every moment as well though Ursula scared her a bit as she did I at the age of 5. She wanted to sit watch it all over again (we did not),  so I guess it didnt scare her too much."
This was a good movie with laughs and vivid visuals. Halle voice is so beautiful. The cast was good too. B+
I enjoyed the diverse cast. The music was good. It had action as well as romance and some funny parts
This is why I don't like critics. This movie is actually pretty good. Not disappointed at all.
Loved this movie! It was visually stunning and so well done.
Little long but quality superseded
I loved it!!! Was so worth the wait!
Actors were perfect!!! Instant classic.
Amazing!!!! Best live action remake. Halle was phenomenal.
"Childhood memories unlocked, I loved everything about it!"
Amazing movie loved it
Loong. Made me sleepy. But my girls loved it
"Great lesson! Allow people to live their own lives, especially when they are about doing good in the world."
I loved the movie. The characters they selected and everything. I would definitely recommend people to go see it.
"The Little Mermaid was breathtaking and magnificent. Halle Bailey was magnificent as Ariel. I mean, her voice gave off a lot of emotion from me. And Ursula, the Sea Witch gave a great performance, especially during her “Poor Unfortunate Souls” number. And Prince Eric, the heartthrob was just perfect as a young prince who was an adventurer by trade. Overall, The Little Mermaid was amazing, an incredible remake and reimagining of a beloved Disney classic."
"AMAZING 10 out of 10!!!! The entire cast did a phenomenal job, love it!!"
Great storyline and outstanding acting..
What a great movie !!
"Excellent, My granddaughter loved it. She wore her little mermaid shirt and brung her little mermaid doll and took pictures with the little mermaid display. Everyone clapped at the end of the movie. Very excellent!!!!!!!"
The movie was awesome!
It was Fantastic the 3D effects were amazing
We thoroughly enjoyed the movie!!! The singing was awesome and the crab and bird were really funny.  The entire audience clapped at the end. Worth seeing in the theatre!!!
I love the whole entire movie it brought back to my childhood. Great job
"Excellent movie, great job Halle!!!!"
"Absolutely loved it, maybe more than the first one"
"I Loved The Movie , I Cried About 3 or 4 Times. My Daughter Also Enjoyed It Very Much. I Can Tell When This Goes To Disney Plus , We’ll Be Watching It On Repeat"
This was an awesome movie!!!!
Still a great movie for all ages and its a very special feeling to see a new version with your kids!
"I have loved The Little Mermaid since it came out. The storyline, the characters and the songs. The live-action movie was AMAZING! Major kudos to the casting director on this one! This will definitely be one I watch over and over again."
Beautifully reimagined take on a classic
The 4DX experience was awesome and some of the movie felt fresh.
What a beautiful romantic love story with some comedy 😍 that's the movie 🍿🎥 that I love but it's more towards older children/Adults not for the little kiddo's #BlackMermaid u rock gurl👍🏾
Halle was amazing! The casting was perfect! The bird was hilarious! Outstanding production!
So different then the original I understand changing a little but that was far from it. Very disappointing. The actors was every well picked to fit the characters but changed so many details.
"Movie was awesome, it's a must see! I liked the idea, that the storyline was practically the same as the animated version, along with a few extras. I'm extremely pleased with the fact that Disney incorporated a very diverse group of people for the making of this film. It was very well put together, and Hailey Bailey did an amazing job in playing her role as Ariel."
"Loved the movie. Sebastian was a little mild in the beginning, but I gee to like him. Halle nailed Ariel. Melissa also nailed Ursula. This is the first Disney live action movie I actually enjoyed. You should definitely check it out."
Awesome graphics this was really good
EXCELLENT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"The movie works really well when it takes its notes from the animated film (and Andersen fairy-tale) that inspired it instead of the Buzzfeed comment section. There's not a weak link among the cast, least of all the effervescent Halle Bailey."
Great movie. A must see.
"Great story, terrific cast, perfect timing. And music..."
"Dont Listen To These Fools When They Say It Wasn’t Good… I Actually Liked It , But What Mostly Mattered Is Seeing My Daughter Enjoy The Whole Movie With Excitement,!!!! She Didnt Care That The Characters Didn’t Look Like The Originals, She Still Understood Who Was Who. I Give It A Solid 10"
Nostalgic at its finest
We loved it!!!  I totally got chills watching my favorite Disney movie turned into live action.  BRAVO!
Halle was absolutely phenomenal! The perfect choice
Awesome still like the original one as well but this new one was really cute
Fun for the whole family. From start to finish.
It was put together very well. A fun movie!!
Cool movie. The kids and I really enjoyed
Awesome songs and graphics.
"CGI, storyline, the acting: PERFECTION. I’d give this movie 10 stars if I could."
"Music,  storyline, and the scoots were great.  Sierra is beautiful and has a great voice.  Very funny lines.  This review is from the kids as as adults"
I loved this movie! Stunning visuals and they didnt change the story. It was amazing from start to finish!
It was a very cute movie! Disney did a great job.
Halle Bailey and the rest of the cast! Great singers!
The original Little Mermaid has always been my favorite! They did an amazing job. And Melissa McCarthy was the perfect Ursula.
Too different from the original.
"3D was very enjoyable.  Frankly, this was maybe the 2nd time we have been to the theatre since the pandemic.
Very enjoyable experience.  A feel good movie made it even better."
"Absolutely incredible music, new songs, stunning colors and breathtaking visuals! Loved it! One of my favorite live-actions so far. Could have done without the one rap song though.."
"After having to get over the fact that Halle Berry was not in it and it was Halle Bailey, I really enjoyed it. Melissa McCarthy was awesome. Great love story and I cried."
Loved the colors... a bit too scary for a 4-year-old though. I forgot about Ursula although she did a fabulous job.
The movie was absolutely amazing! Its so beautiful that my daughter was able to see a mermaid that looked like her!
Oh the Little 🧜🏾‍♀️ #Mermaid was everything. Hailee is the absolute best Ariel I've seen and her voice is so captivating.  #welldonedisney
"My daughters love this version, and the changes Disney made it didn’t bother them at all, thank you Disney !!"
"Great movie for the kids. The Crab, Pelican and Flounder made the movie worthwhile."
"It was really great, just a little too long."
This movie was amazing! I loved it! Disney...5 stars!❤️
My friend and I loved it.
"WellI read a ton of reviews before going to see itIm not so sure what all the negative criticism is. I mean is it the original, gosh no! However I followed the whole movie as if I was watching the cartoon. Theres a few new scenes and some left out, but for the most part it sticks pretty closely to the original. I thought Sebastian missed the mark. He couldve been so funny, but the lines were delivered so boringly. Ariel was perfectly fine. Beautiful voice. Ursula was great. I dont know. Would I see it again? No. But glad I saw it, and saw it in the theater"
I missed my flamingos.
Great movie and Halle Bailey was fantastic! So nice to see a Disney movie with a leading actress who is representing women of color. Well done!
"The movie was very good. It followed the original version. Great job, everyone!"
Halle Bailey is phenomenal as Ariel.  Her voice is incredible.  Great movie!
We absolutely loved it!
"Hallie has an amazing voice. Cute movie, great special effects but not a fan of the new songs added. Where where was Chef Louis??!!!!! No Le Poisson?!!!! WHAT! Ruined it for me. Shouldn’t have cut one of the most beloved scene from The Little Mermaid. 👎🏼👎🏼"
Beautiful in 3D with the ocean scenes
Super Happy to watch Little Mermaid!.. I really love Disney Movies!
A little boring toward the middle but then it picks up again
"Im always skeptical of these remakes. Especially such a beloved movie. But if you go into this with an open mind I think its one that can be enjoyed by old and new fans alike. I felt it stayed true to the story, and the characters were great. For those who are giving this movie poor reviews, I feel like theyre probably the same ones that were upset as soon as they saw the movie poster."
The movie was very good my grown self cried several times a must see Halle did amazing
"Amazing! Kept both kids engrossed for 2+ hours. Actors were extremely talented, costumes were spot on, and the singing was magical."
I thought it was very well done. especially terrific in 3D.
Loved the movie! It was great to hear the classics!
Didnt really like the new song added and I wish they would have included the part on how Ariel is the star of the concerts
"Excellent remake, I did not know what to expect but it was better than the original ."
It was fantastic my family loved it
It was better than the og! Some things were taken out but the things that were added were even better! But will say it was 90% true to the og
It was absolutely amazing!!! I love Halle
"Just Amazing!! Growing up with the Little Mermaid this movie was a wonderful nod to the original while giving it a modern spin that every little princess can relate to and see herself as one of King Tritons daughters :) Halle is stunning and Sebastian and Scuttle will make you laugh out loud! You may even shed a tear by the end. Just simply wonderful Disney Magic, can’t wait to see it again :)"
"I went in the theater with low expectations, and I came away from the movie pleasantly surprised.  I think Halle Bailey did a good job playing Ariel.  And she sang the songs very well.  God bless and may he put her on the right path."
Thoroughly enjoyed the movie
I absolutely enjoyed this movie!! It was even better in 3D. Will definitely go see it again.
Very cute! Great casting. Great music. It is lengthy!! 2 1/2 hours and 30 minute preview is a long time for kids. The previews did contain a little language .. overall loved it. Ursula was a bit scary and may be too much  for some younger viewers. We talked about it a lot beforehand and throughout.  I love this adaptation
awesome. Halle Bailey is awesome so is Melissa McCarthy
"The family loved it! If you’re a fan of the original, this one won’t disappoint but will perhaps surprise. :)"
"It's was a Disney feel good movie, with joy and singing."
"Stuck to the original storyline well  and wife cried throughout, so it was a hit."
Best remake!! great cast- beautiful picture and music
"Absolutely LOVE! My girls sung their hearts out, the new songs were such a nice addition as well. Rated 10 stars!!"
Halle is everything!!!
It was ok it just doesn’t quite work with real people
"Great movie, love the computer animation."
Loved it. It was amazing Halle Bailey is an amazing Ariel and the cast I loved as well. Love the ending too.
The movie was SPECTACULAR
"I took my 13 year old grandaughter because she asked to go.  We both had seen the movie numerous, numerous times when she was little.  To the point where we both knew all the words.  I did not expect to like this movie since I was so entrenched with the one when she was little.  We both really enjoyed it!  They made just enough changes in this movie to make it interesting yet kept it close enough to the original to feel comfortable with it.  The movie was awesome.  I like that they fleshed our Prince Eric's character.  I felt myself feeling getting involved with the story more than I did previously.  It was great!"
Thought it was really fun! Did not like the Scuttle Butt song. Otherwise - a great re-imagining of this classic that both my Husband and I saw in college. It was fun to take both our 16 and 19 yr. olds with us for the journey.
This was the first movie I ever saw in theaters when I was 7 years old. I have been so excited to see this since I heard it was going to be made! The beginning and end gave me cold chills. I dont think they could have found a more PERFECT Eric!! I didnt like that they changed some names-like of her sisters and they left out a few scenes that I LOVED like the chef making crab but those are literally my only complaints. The girl that played Ariels voice is absolutely perfect! Melissa McCarthy even plays a good villain!
Halle did what needed to be done 🥹👏🏽👏🏽 Amazing cast . Super funny while so warming
"The movie was fantastic. Some of the comic relief was lost with the phrasing changes, but it was still great. Halle Bailey is the perfect Little Mermaid! I can't give it 5 stars because they cut my favorite scene!"
The BEST live-action Disney remake TO DATE! It took me back to my childhood and then some. Everybody absolutely killed their performances but Halle Bailey truly embodies and is our Princess Ariel. 🥹🧜🏽‍♀️♥️ Melissa McCarthy ATE as Ursula! An absolute MUST SEE! My inner child was jumping for joy! Cried multiple times… will watch again and again and again!
I had low expectations for a live adaptation but this one was FANTASTIC.
Beautiful movie💐💐💐
Absolutely beautiful and fun. Great new MILD changes to scripts. The casting was spot on. I will watch this again and again.
Beautiful and inspired. Such a great film.
"It was perfect. It was virtually beautiful. It was funny, exciting, heartwarming, heartbreaking and everything else in between. I loved it. The cast was perfect."
I think I enjoyed  it more than my granddaughter...She's  a fan of the original....Definitely  a great movie  ...Hailie's voice is powerful...Brought a tear to my eye several  times throughout the film
"They couldn't have picked a better person to be Arielle.  Halle truly embodied Arielle's soul!  The movie was breathtaking!  I loved every minute!
The music was also amazing!"
The kiss the girl scene.
The visual effects were very impressive watching the movie in Real 3D but overall the movie is not something I would want to watch again on a television. My daughter said the same thing after we left the theater.
"Although it may not have what I grew up watching, I really enjoyed it. What made me love it even more was the joy and pride it brought my girls watching it. I already had to find the doll for my youngest ( at Target if anyone wants to know)"
the singing was absolutely amazing! we loved Sebastian so much! Hilarious!
It was a great adaptation of the original story. It was entertaining from beginning to end. I also love the Caribbean representation.
Good acting and music. Beautiful color throughout
Beautiful singing!! Ursula was amazing! Flounder was a little creepy lol
The whole thing was beautiful!
Great movie. Maybe a bit too long for the kids. Some started to get restless. Great choice of actors playing the characters. 3D was really good! Gotta go see it for yourself!
An incredible and sweeping synthesis of ingenuity and spirit - outstanding in every aspect of movie-making. So thankful to anyone who had anything to do with this production - amazing.
"That it would be brighter, but I guess cause its about living in the sea"
Loved!!! It was everything I thought it would be and more. My daughter Loved it so much that she said she wanted to be a mermaid too.
Beautifully done. The music and actors were amazing.
I completely love the entire movie the cast the setting the music all it was so so beautiful I would so amazing so enjoyed being in the theater watching and enjoying this wonderful production I am at all of everything that was done and I commend the entire cast crew lighting settings etc. It was amazing
"I was pleasantly surprised on how much I like this movie! The lead was great, the songs were better, I highly recommend you take your family to see this movie!"
"Amazing. The graphics , her vocals , great job."
"I really liked it, her voice is incredible"
10/10 I cried a little. This movie deserves awards. Taking my daughters and their friends to see this movie brought me back to when I saw the movie when I was a kid.
This movie was amazing  Halle Bailey did her thing in this movie
It was so cute! I loved it and so did my Granddaughter
The movie was great. Loved the underwater scenes and activity. Adults and teens should enjoy this probably more than younger children.
Hailey was indeed a princess. I was happy to see that there were deviations from the original make. Most likable was Ariel's family--seen in every race/color. This is one of Disney's best live-action remakes I've ever seen.
The movie was absolutely great! The new songs just added to the greatest of it.
Fantastic experience!
It is absolutely beautiful.
Loved the diversity of the cast! I really enjoyed it.
I loved the movie it wS excellent
"Loved it! Halle Baileys beautiful performance, the cinematography, the singing of my favorite songs, the voice actors, I literally got chills at certain parts. The familiar story told in beautiful live action. Perfect"
🧜‍♀️everyone was bbgs
It was fantastic! I had a great time
Honestly such a great movie!!! My daughter and I loved it .
Absolutely loved every minute of the movie
A great take on the original.
This movie is SO GOOD! me and my mother love this movie. Hallie Bailey was beautiful and then she sing!! I almost cry.
"The movie was so fun and kept me and the kids' attention. I also laughed and I don't usually laugh in movies,  especially geared for kids. Wouldn't mind watching it again!"
Halle was amazing. Loved the addtl character development for Eric.
Too far off from the original.
Halle Bailey is a star. wow. Great time and true to animated version which was fun
A fresh fatais on a classic. Everyone was perfectly cast. I loved reliving it and letting my kids be a part of this world.
Loved it! Halle did an amazing job! 💜
"I absolutely loved it, It’s a must see!!! Grab your daughter, step daughter, God daughter, niece and take them to see this amazing movie!!! Thank me later"
"GREAT MOVIE!!!! The acting, singing, animation, costumes…Everything was great! Definitely a must see & a purchase for home. My 11 yrs old twins (boy/girl) loved it, my son was surprised how much he enjoyed it. Awesome job from cast & crew!"
"Beautiful, wholesome and so admirable. Loved it with all my heart and Halle Bailey is a natural STAR🤭♥️"
Well done Disney! This was amazing!
Truly magical movie that stayed true to the original while also adding a bit more back story to the main characters. Halle and Melissa were top notch!
"A very good movie! I would definitely recommend. it brought back memories from my childhood.
halle did good along with the other cast."
Few good parts. Mostly cringy
My daughter and I really enjoyed it!
"It was a great production that told the story from many different perspectives. A must see, especially if you liked the original!"
amazing movie and really great 3d
It was amazing my granddaughter loved the movie
I liked those 2 songs: “Under the Sea” and “Kiss the Girl”
"Haven't seen the original in a while but I think I liked this one better. Actually got choked up a little at times. Halle Bailey had a 
n incredible performance."
Terrible. Cheesy. Bad acting. Bad singing.
Had me from the beginning!! I saw the 3D version and recommend it. Great casting and I will watch it again.
Great job. All the feels.
I loved the movie!!! They did a fantastic job and followed the story from the cartoon!! Well made movie!!
I really enjoyed this movie. The story plot  kept you engage. Made you laugh cry and sing. My husband went with me he didn’t want to but he had to  admit it was good.
A great reimagining of a classic.
4DX it was awesome! Probably my first and last 4DX lol it was an experience.
"A bit long for the little ones, but overall a great experience. I would say age 7 or up on the scare factor"
Better than expected
I loved it! so much fun . I'm gonna a go see it again
Absolutely loved it!!! 4D is must
The movie was better than the original with a great message! Our family really enjoyed it!!
Very Beautiful Movie!!!
Great movie would definitely recommend and go see it again
"Better than the original, which is one of my top 5 movies. It was so visually stunning. I can do without the new Sebastian and Scuttle voices, but Halle and Melissa were amazing!"
Everthing in the movie was good.
It is such a great movie!
"SO GOOD!!! Absolutely better than the original!! The cast was phenomenal and I loved the expanded story and new songs. Such a beautiful, emotional, INCREDIBLE film!!!"
Movie was amazing!  I wouldnt change a thing!
Some of the big moments felt rushed and lacked passion.
Halle Bailey did amazing as Ariel! Everything about the movie was just spectacular. The accuracy to the animated and even the scenes that were adapted to it were fun and cute. Melissa McCarthy was perfect for the role! Would absolutely see it again and again.
Fantastic movie! Halle Bailey and Melissa McCarthy were excellent as Ariel and I loved it as much as the original!
Very good movie for the whole family
"I love it, Halle Bailey, Melissa McCarthy, everybody performance, the music, the visual. It was everything I hoped for and more. I love Ariel and Eric you really felt how much they love each other. Incredible!!!!!!!!!!"
The acting and singing was great.  Loved all of the OG songs and new ones as well.
Better than I expected. It was very good I enjoyed it with my twelve year old.
Great adaptation!   Follows the original story yet none of the new stuff gets in the way.  GO SEE THIS MOVIE!
"It was fabulous.  The music, the acting and the cinematography were all outstanding!"
I liked that the actress that played Ariel sounded like Ariel from the cartoon.
Good real time portrayal of the mermaid story
Very well done. Everyone did great but both Halle and Melissa owned the roles. A must see
Amazing! Representation matters!
Moving! Emotional! Visually Stunning! Everyone should go see this film!
This movie was beautiful. Just absolutely beautiful. The cast was stunning and incredibly talented. Such a gorgeous movie. I wish I could rate this movie 1000 stars!
My daughter loved the movie.. Halle Bailey did amazing Job!
"It reminded me of the old movie so much, and there was some choices that were taken differently and they came out very well!! Overall happy with this film, it brought back childhood memories"
The movie was awesome its my favorite movie.
amazing amazing amazing period
Good movie. Not a fan of the stor though. I never saw the original. Halle Bailey was AMAZING! Singing was top notch. Definitely one of the better Disney live action remales
"Great movie, beautiful underwater scenes, just feels like something is missing towards the end"
"Little Mermaid was my favorite movie growing up, and this was an incredible adaptation of it.  I wouldn't change a thing."
Wonderful Disney did it again
"Beautiful movie, Ariel, Sebastian & Scuttle stole the show! Great new songs."
The singing was phenomenal. Halle and entire cast did an awesome job. Truly enjoyed taking daughter to see the movie.
"My granddaughter was bought to tears after the movie, she waited until we left to scream how she thought it was the best movie!"
It was a great great movie!!
"Absolutely loved this rendition!!! Much better character building, better representation of the geographic locale, great diverse casting choices, fabulous new songs, beautiful graphics, and fantastic story. The only thing I didnt love was casting of Ursula not that it was terrible but I think they could have gone a better direction with her. Highly recommend this movie!!"
"The Little Mermaid was the first Disney movie I saw when I was a kid, and I hated it. This film is visually stunning and has more heart than the original. I found the storyline more compelling, the conflict more enthralling, and the characters more engaging. That said, this felt like Disney 2020. Very shiny, but would have fallen flat if it werent for the Javier Bardem and Melissa McCarthy delivering performances that were the opposite of Disneys soulless machine."
Loved it! Stuck to the script and delivered!
"I enjoyed it, but more importantly the children did too."
The new Little Mermaid was a perfect love story. Beautifully done. Kids loved it!! A must see!!
Great movie! The whole family loved it!!
"It was ok. Ariel was the best part of the movie. Everyone else was honestly kind of bland, especially Ursula."
Amazing Amazing Representation makes a difference!!!!
"The movie was great, the other patrons ruined the experience."
It was amazing. Halle did a great job with Ariel.
"The movie stayed true to the original, except for a few small details and the lack of ""Le Poisson"" plus the addition of a few new songs. I didn't mind the changes and thought the acting and CGI was really great."
"it was great did not disappoint the music was on point, Eric was better than expected, Ursula was very good Melissa McCarthy did an amazing job I got chills through out the whole movie. I felt like a child seeing the little mermaid for the first time"
I thought it was excellent!. Well done Disney!
Great job with the music and production
It was a fun movie. Why compare the old vs new? They were both great for the decade in which they were made. Will definitely see this a hundred times also.
"I really enjoyed this! It’s the best live action they’ve made, and the kept the best parts of the old film and added some new stuff. It worked, I loved everything about it."
"Gorgeously led by the incomparable Halle Bailey, The Little Mermaid is a beautiful film in every aspect. Wonderful chemistry between the leads, a terrific new spin on a familiar tale, and music to dance your heart out to."
I loved the movie. Especially the closing scene
Great movie with our daughter!
Such an absolute joy to watch! A must see film!
"Not too much was different from the original animated movie. They added a few new songs, adapted the older ones only a minuscule of ways. Visually stunning underwater settings. It seems they changed from a black sea region to Caribbean?"
"I recently watched the new Little Mermaid movie, and unfortunately, I was extremely disappointed. The characters were not relatable at all, and the movie lacked any original content that was different from the original movie. 

Firstly, the characters in the movie were unrelatable and lacked depth. The lead character, Ariel, was portrayed as an overly emotional and naive character who seemed to be constantly chasing after Prince Eric. Her character lacked any real growth or development, and it felt like she was simply going through the motions of the original movie without any real substance. 

Secondly, the movie lacked any original content that set it apart from the original movie. The storyline was virtually the same as the original, with no real twists or turns that made it unique or interesting. It felt like the filmmakers were simply trying to cash in on the success of the original movie without putting any real effort into creating something new and exciting.

Overall, I was extremely disappointed with the new Little Mermaid movie. The characters were not relatable, and the movie lacked any original content that would have made it stand out from the original. If you are a fan of the original movie, I would not recommend wasting your time watching this lackluster remake."
That it was the same basis from the original story but with human  emotions to draw in more connectivity. Only down side is that Sebastian was not the correct animal and that the musical scene under the sea was not Performed in the same manner.
the BEST live action disney princess movie. This was so cute i cried so many times. I cant wait watch it again
Such a great remake! Haile did amazing in her debut movie
This movie was very good! It brought joy to the kids and adults in my family and we all thoroughly enjoyed it together.
"It was better than I thought, and I don't care much for original Disney Little Mermaid movie."
good movie!! I enjoy it. 👌
Very nice update to the classic.
I loved the diversity in the movie. Made every little girl believe they can be a mermaid
The movie was average songs to slow
Excellent! Two thumbs up!!
The movie is amazing! It’s a must see💙 Everyone played their part. 10/10 would recommend
love the movie and the music
Loved they kept the storyline with such beautiful scenes in and out the water. The cast was phenomenal
This movie was wonderful. The whole cast is beautiful and handsome. I love seeing such unity and love.
"The Little Mermaid  was a MASTERPIECE and we LOVED it so much! In my opinion, this is, by far, Disney's best live adaptation to date. We can't wait to see it again. I was so excited to see Halle Bailey as Ariel and she surpassed allll of my expectations. She was absolutely perfect. The whole cast was. They truly found the best way to honor the original film while adding plot and film aspects that enhance the film rather than cluttering it or taking away from the essence of the original. My ONLY complaint was that I didn't like the Scuttlebutt song and I didn't feel like it fit into the rest of the film. But it wasn't a big enough deal to tarnish my opinion of the film overall."
"Halle Bailey is the perfect Ariel. Loved this movie when I was a kid, loved it now. A+"
"The movie was pretty good from the images to the songs to the plotline, it had plenty of moral lessons people could take to heart. Sometimes parents just need to listen, don't be selfish, and discriminate against the humans and mermaids! ( talking about the mother). I like the songs it was so fun to sing especially the rap segment. Sabastian was so hilarious with the seagull. 

Halle plaid her character well, she was so cute and talented. She may not look like the original but you have to understand what Disney was going for. The sisters are all from seven seas, in the cartoon they lived on some type of island, and Sebastian being a Jamaican crab was a hint of what kind of island they lived on. So why not go to the Caribbean or something?  So it made sense why they would make Ariel be from the Island. Another thing some black people have ginger hair and blond hair, learn your facts. Lastly, I was hoping Ariel's sisters would have another line, like them searching for her and finding her depressed after finding out about the prince. All in all, it was a good movie, they all did well"
Watched it twice already!!
This adaptation revamped the story so beautifully every one was phenomenal ! GO HALLE
I was never a big fan of the cartoon movie growing up much but this live action version was phenomenal! The way they were able to bring this to life was so amazing and I want to see it again. Bravo! Halle Bailey and Melissa McCartney did the thing!
It was absolutely amazing!!! Even better than expected!
She did an amazing job 🙌🏿🙌🏿🙌🏿
"Halle was stunning as Ariel she really made it her own. The whole cast was really great! I honestly couldn’t keep my eyes off of her. I cried. There were a few things like the wedding and the dress choices that were missed for me, however my daughter and her friends loved it. I love the diversity of the sea kingdom it was beautiful a true representation of the world. I really can’t wait to see the behind the scenes because this movie is stunning. Bravo 🎉 Disney."
It was so much better than I expected!!! I’m ABSOLUTELY going to see it again!
"Loved it! Love the new writing, new songs, new jokes."
A must see…great movie for the family !!!
Way better than the Lion King Remake. The underwater effects could've been borrowed from James Cameron
Disney did a great job in bringing The Little Mermaid to life. Great cast and beautiful colors and scenery. The only thing I could have lived without is the Prince's solo song.
amazing amazing amazing!!!!!!
Absolutely beautiful and fun!! Halle truly was the best pick for the role of Ariel.
"The music was beautiful, and the visuals were very nice, if little dark. Halle Baily is lovely as Ariel and Melissa Mcarthy does amazing as Ursula."
Wish this film would have kept the script original. Very rough to sit through. Come on Disney! Do better! Very disappointing.
The best live action Disney movie depiction I have ever seen!!
I liked when Scuttle said Bow Chicka Wow Wow and when Ariel was looking at the crystal mermaid. The sound track is still a gem and new songs too! Captivating and wonderful.
"Ive always loved the little mermaid and was worried about the changes but the movie was wonderful! Halle Baileys voice was amazing, I love how they made it more realistic and gave more to the story!"
Amazing. Halle did her thing!
Great funny movie for everyone
"I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of this remake. Acting was great, singing was on point. The humor from Sebastian was spot on. Although it was a bit jarring to see Flounder & Sebastian more “realistic” vs the catoon version, it was still great! Halle Bailey acted very well & Melissa McCarthy did just as well too! Great casting!"
"A genuinely good family family. I thiblnk there were some boring moments to my son but dafinitely some enjoyable moments too! Some things I wish they hadn't changed and some changes I thought made the movie better. I did not care for the actor who played King Triton, no offense to him, he is probably an excellent actor, just not someone I enjoyed playing the character. Halle Bailey was an excellent choice for Ariel. She played the role exceedingly well. Aqua as Skuttle was....an interesting choice. There were ups and downs but I would say she did alright to entertain. Made my son laugh. Sebastian's voice could have used more emotion within his dialogue when it was needed....you can't see much emotion with a real crab...but he could have showed it more in his voice somehow. Wasn't a fan with Ariel steering the ship at the end instead of Eric. All the the musical portions of the movie were amazing!!!! I would have liked to see more sea animals for Under the Sea but aside from that it was great!! The Little Mermaid, animated version, has been my all time favorite since I was a little girl so this is just my critique coming out due to it being a favorite with all the changes. If you are a true fan of the previous movie, I suggest seeing it. I had my doubts due to people's comments and predictions before but after seeing it, let's just say the pros outweigh the cons for this live action movie remake."
"Halle Bailey is a growing young actress who is perfect for the roll, which is only the start of her career."
It was a cute movie but didnt really like how they changed some essential parts towards the end in my opinion. Will watch again though when it comes to Disney+
My favorite Disney live action movie so far! Halle Bailey made the perfect Ariel.
I loved the movie cause my 6 yr old granddaughter had a grin from ear to ear the whole time.
"It was fantastic. I loved the additions they made to the original. At the same time, they did the OG proud!!! Everyone should go see this."
"At least as good as, or better than, the original animated version in all respects. Only significant shortcoming was the casting of Javier Bardem as Triton."
Got week at the end. Could have found a better actor for king Trident. Several changes from the original classic.
Bad acting and the movie flow seemed forced
"Loved the new version, songs, voices, actors were all incredible!"
"The movie was flawless, we absolutely loved it"
Very lovely film had new elements with a nod to the classic of course. Very amazing would watch again
"This Disney re-make is delightful.  I loved the way people of all races were portrayed.  Ariel couldn't have been better.  It is a little scary for little kids, but older kids will love it.  The cast was incredible and we thoroughly enjoyed it."
I LOVED IT! It was such a beautiful movie like omgggggg
Enjoyed the singing and the ending made me cry
Movie was AMAZING I CANT WAIT TO SEE IT AGAIN!
Amazing!!! My childhood is complete!!
The kids and I loved it! We saw it in 3D! I love that they kept a lot of the original songs!
I the differences they made to the story in this updated version of the movie separate from the exciting diversity! Very enjoyable!
"kids loved it. The people on  theater yelled, and clapped when it was over. kids were quiet and watching the whole movie!"
It was a little rushed
I loved everything about this movie! So sad people are basing their reviews off the color of her skin! Welcome to ameriKKKa
"there were parts that were amazing, the colors, the animation on point. there were parts that were a little clumsy, the interaction of actors and live action. overall, good job."
I love the whole movie. It was beautiful! They chose the right girl to play Ariel. I cant wait to watch it again.
"I considered myself a hardcore little mermaid and Ursula fan. Going in I was kinda nervous that they might ruin the classic like some of previous remakes, instead i was blown away. From the singing, new add-on songs/scenes/characters’ background to the parts/details that they cut of from the original, making this the best live action adaptation yet. Every decision to include or exclude certain elements from the original was carefully thought-out, it doesn’t take away the beauty of the original story and it doesn’t overbear/bore like if it was taken frame by frame from the original. Halle is a solid singer/actor “period”. Her performance smacked a lot of rotten eggs on haters’ head. People keep picking/mocking on the part where she sing the word “FREE”, completely blinded by that add-on style of singing/dialogue, they seemed to not understand why it would make sense to keep that cut of the song and missed the other of wonderful things she implemented throughout the song. Melissa’s Ursula was chef-kiss. Jonah was perfect as a prince should. The whole cast was wonderful. I think people do not give this Sebastian enough credit, sure the animated/realistic crab could be a little better, but Daveed’s performance is definitely up there for me. Lastly, if you are going in just to look for something to hate about this film, you gonna hate it, regardless of the other million things they did right, so be open-mind and Hope you enjoy it as much as i did!"
It was better then I thought it would be. We loved the movie.
"Very colorful, stunning visuals. Despite similar story, it wasnt a shot by shot remake. Melissa McArthys acting as Ursula was really good. 
Sebastian was super cute.All the voices were really similar  to the ones from the animated Little Mermaid."
I enjoyed the whole movie! Seeing it in 3d was the absolute best
Amazing live action. Updated but still true to the original story.
"The Movie was Great! Hailey done a great job! All of the Characters were great. I like the plot, Disney done a great job. Definitely a must see and a movie you want  to have in your favorites collection."
"If you loved the original animated movie, you will love, love, love this version.  Little Mermaid was the first movie I took my daughter to see. she was only 2. Little Mermaid has always been her favorite movie...now X2."
"I love everything about it, my children enjoy it. The actors/actresses were awesome. I like her dated with the prince. This version of The Little Mermaid takes all the awesome moments, dialogue, and songs from the original and adds a modern flavor to it. Even the new songs were great, with the Scuttle song in the style of Lin-Manuel Miranda being a nice, entertaining surprise. The pacing was perfect and it knew exactly how much time to spend on each part of the story, not overextending at all. It understands comedic timing so well, and the casting choices for Ursula and Sebastian were genius. This version of Sebastian was top tier and Melissa McCarthy brings her all. Hayle Bailey was awesome as always."
Such a disappointment.
Loved this movie. Didn't think I would say this but it's better than the original.
It was whitewashed and they didn’t have chemistry.   The little mermaid and Úrsula were great!
"This was such a great production! So far the best Disney live action, and the actors were on point! Halle Bailey is a queen, she is so perfect for Ariel. I will be rewatching this movie"
"It felt like a bunch of people in one movie trying to remake the little mermaid.  My daughters favorite princess and one of my favorite movies, just could not connect to this movie."
"Loved everything about the movie! I laughed, cried, recited words, sung the songs and danced along to the new tunes. Fantastic job!"
This is how you remake a movie! You leave it like the original
"It was half and half for me, Ariel has a great singing voice, and Eric was good, but there were some people acting that was a bit disappointing, and the new songs were okay but they just didn't fit with the vibe that the original soundtrack, and they took out the best scenes that the original animation film had which was disappointing as well. For me personally at the beginning, it was a bit boring but towards the end, it was interesting especially when Ariel finds out about Ursula."
"I loved it so much, my daughter and her best friend also enjoyed it."
Loved it.  Halle Bailey was great.
"Clever substitutions from my childhood version,  a must see!"
"I love it. There were a couple of things I felt they could have done differently, but as a whole, I loved it."
Amazing! Halle is a superstar. Flounder and Sebastian could have been done better appearance and animation wise.
"Good movie. The moral of the story is, two culture can come together as one. God is the creator of all.  Love conquers everything and everyone. Prosper together and let God do the judging. Be blessed."
"Very well done!
Reimagined beautifully!
Wonder filled!
Not a fan Eric,s first song"
"The story line was changed, the characters changed and the songs that made the movie a hit and fun to sing along with back then were also changed. And these changes were not for the better. The characters were not fun or engaging.
The acting was weak, the backgrounds and settings not attractive."
Amazing remake of this classic! Halle fid amazingggg and Melissa McCarthy is also GOLD on the screen!
I enjoyed it but the acting was very blah. Only person who seemed to give it their all was Melissa McCarthy. I loved the new songs and the take on the originals.
My daughters and I absolutely loved the diversity throughout the movie! Hailey Bailey did an amazing job!!!!
The movie was so vivid with all the colors in the ocean. Halle Bailey was a wonderful Ariel she did an awesome job.  I would give this movie 100 %
"I loved the movie! it stayed true to the original story and I liked the added character development for Eric. Halle Bailey was phenomenal, her voice is magical. Ursula's  character was well played by Melissa McCarthy and Sebastian and Scuttle were great comic reliefs. I thought there should have been some flashback scenes with Ariel and King Triton to establish  their relationship more....their chemistry was flat. Overall, it was a great live action remake!"
"I loved the beautiful sea animals, colors, songs, and theme."
"This was a great family movie! Brought back memories plus new ones. Tip, don't bring children under 4 years old, it's not animated so it will not keep them entertained. Crying babies and toddlers is annoying."
"I love the story, action, and the graphics of the movie."
The performances of the entire cast were amazing! Obviously the songs in the Little Mermaid were Caribbean so it was great to see the representation in the movie as well
It was an excellent movie!  Top notch  I would recommend all ages to see it. Perfect vocals and photography. I would see it again.
It was absolutely one of the best live action movies Disney as made to date! I cried so many happy tears and I know Ill watch again and again just like the original animated version! 10/10 its a must see! I would give it more than 5 stars if I could!
"The movie was well done, fun for young children and families alike. One we'll see again."
"The movie was captivating with the music , songs and colorful scenery from start to finish. Halle did an excellent job as Arielle and Melissa as Ursula. The comedy was on point as Sebastian and other characters. The children and adults in our audience applauded and LOVED it!"
Halle Bailey did such an amazing job as Ariel! I dont think anyone else could have brought the character to real life the way she did. The rest of the cast also did a great job and the music was incredible!
"Overall, I enjoyed the movie.  My girls have seen the original many times and also enjoyed the movie.   They didn't sing my favorite song. I'd be lying if I said I didn't laugh or have any emotional connection to parts of it.  if my girls wanted to see it again, I would go with them."
"The cast was terrific! Great live adaptation -- the ""Under the Sea"" choreography was beautiful!"
I loved the movie. It was good. Has its own twist but still gave me nostalgia of the original.
"The movie was great. From the visuals, to the music, to the acting abilities of the whole cast. I had a smile on my face during the whole movie. I tried to look get rid of that smile on my face while watching the movie, but it was stuck there the whole time. I want to see it again 😅"
Halle and Jonah were great. They had amazing chemistry. Sebastian and scuttle were funny. Didnt love the VFX but the movie was really cute. So many goosebumps during part of your world!!
I absolutely loved every minute of it .
Such a great movie!! A new take on a classic with elements of the original film sprinkled throughout.
The singing was great. My husband who was reluctant to got is still talking about it this morning.  Another Disney classic that I can’t wait to watch with the grandkids.
It was an awesome movie. Magical
"It was a WONDERFUL movie. I Thoroughly enjoyed every second. The actors, theatrics, sounds, singing and animations were incredible! I strongly recommend!"
Amazing !! it was done perfectly ! and the smile on every child face who sees the representation is heartwarming !
The movie was awesome. The theater...not so great. You can order food from your theater seat and they'll bring it to you. Servers were bringing food to people all through the movie. It was very disruptive.
BeautifulBest Live Action by far !!!! Go watch in 3D
"The movie is over 2 hours, far too long for any smaller children to stay interested.   The original animated LIttle Mermaid was only 83 mins.   This movie had many cute scenes, but it had some scenes that smaller children would find horrifying such as the shark scene.  It just wasn't as fun as the original animated movie.   We missed seeing the scene with the chef and Sebastian, and no one can live up to the Ursula voiced by the late Pat Carroll."
Movie was good. Well done. However the theater sold our seats not twice but three times. People found seat elsewhere but the back row all had multiple people with the same tickets. The theater owner has no idea how it happened
"Despite what a lot of people said about it, I thought it was a really good movie with a great cast! The only thing I can really complain about is the Caribbean accents. I love Daveed Diggs, but the Jamaican accent just wasnt giving honestly (coming from someone who is Jamaican btw). I love the additional songs and as much as everyone else seems to hate to admit it, Lin Manuel Miranda lyrics are always baller."
The movie was awesome! It's sad how even in a kids movie people really lead with their racist thoughts. Change the race of the mermaid and all is forgiven.
I love the lesson to the story.
"Loved the characters, the singing and especially Hallie Baileyportrayal of Ariel, absolutely amazing!"
My Daughter loved it
"AMAZING!! The music, visuals and acting absolutely incredible."
Excellent movie!!! One of my favorite Disney live action movies!!!!
I love the new take on this original classic. The diversity of merpeople from different seas is wonderful to see. I think I enjoy as much as my 7 year old daughter.
I liked it. It was cute. The Little Mermaid was never my favorite Disney movie but I would actually watch this again
The look and feel of the movie were perfect for the type of film that it was.  Good casting.
"The movie captivated my attention from start to finished! I love the storyline and all of the amazing details in the movie, too! The actors were phenomenal as well!"
They made the right changes to the movie which made Ariel become a princess I can get behind and respect my daughter growth and development
Overall great movie! Halle was amazing! Her singing and acting were on point for her first major role. Disney could have done a little better on the CGI of being underwater. And I liked one of the new songs with Scuttle and Sebastian. Go see the movie for yourself!
They did a great job with the movie.  They honored the original while making it all their own.
Movie was amazing especially since we saw it in 4D. It made me feel like I was right in the movie with them. Two thumbs up
"This is a very well know movie my favorite Disney at that I actually waited a long time to see this come to life and wasnt to please.movie but Im going to say what I liked first Eric was given a song, Ursula was awesome. I think Melissa did her part. The little wrapping song that Scotto and Sebastian had. I like how they put the scene for the marriage at the castle instead of the boat.
Now what I didnt like I definitely didnt like her singing I didnt like the extra part of part of this world I didnt like how they made that statue king Tritons acting sucked really bad I didnt like the fact that the sisters names why would they do that I didnt like that they took out the musical in the beginning on why Ariel was missing.
I didnt mind some of the changes, but I definitely would have liked for some of the stuff to stay the same. This is a classic and I dont think that big changes for classics are good. This wasnt a whole different little mermaid movie. This was supposed to be created as a life movie for the classic cartoon movie."
Loved the movie - simply beautiful!
No chemistry between the mermaid and the prince. Songs were just ok. Great visuals.
The movie was literally amazing!! I am going to watch it until I get tired of it. I highly recommend!!
The entire movie and cast were phenomenal and I'm definitely watching it again. They did an amazing job!!! Halle Bailey was superb and the perfect actress for this role!!!!! I watched it in RPM didn't disappoint at all!
Great movie my granddaughter love it. Halle Bailey was great.
"The movie was beautiful! The vibrant colors, the diversity shown, the story was sweet and innocent, and the singing was awesome! My daughter loved it. We cant wait until it comes to Disney plus to watch it again."
"The movie is too long, especially for the little ones. The colorful scenes were amazing. Cool special effects."
We loved the movie. The songs was great. The actors awesome.
Very entertaining and loved the music and scenery. Great movie for the whole family.
Loved the animation. Very loud for children though.
"OMG! I love! Love! LOVE this movie! Ariel is literally my favorite disney princess, and to see Halle Bailey portray her was a bonus! So beautiful! Whole cast/ movie OUTSTANDING! 1000/10 recommend!"
"In no way is this movie suited for little children., there was some lovely parts of the movie but the original  enchantment  of the first film  is nit there. Melissa Mccarthy is pretty fab as Ursula is fabulous ... but the movie is way long..."
Not sure how it got PG rating was very violent for younger kids
Loved all the animations! Great 3 D movie! Lots of people of color!
"Acting, singing, special effects were phenomenal. The remake was inclusive of all races which depicts todays world. Halle Bailey played the perfect Aerial. Not because of her race but because her voice is amazing and she was the right PERSON for the role."
"Excellent, I loved it. Reminded me of my childhood, but better."
I just loved so much …. Beautiful film thanks Disney 😍
"The movie was awesome and Halle did such an amazing job, loved her in this movie."
The movie was beautifully done. The 3D effects were awesome and added so much more to the movie. Halle Bailey played Ariel so gracefully and sang so beautifully in the movie. The remake couldnt have been any better. All the kids reactions in the theater proved that it was a total success. Inclusion is a beautiful and powerful thing and Im so glad to have witnessed so many children and adults alike enjoy a classic turned into a modern day classic all over again.
Amazing movie and cast
Cool to see it in live action.  Good new songs.  Scuttle was the funniest. Kids will enjoy.
Loved it 10/10. Will see it again while it’s still in theaters.
"I loved the movie, the whole cast did great"
"Unfortunately, the new songs and added story elements took away from the film. The lead actress had a beautiful singing voice, but this one didn't have the emotional impact of the original. I'm sure I'm in the minority when I say the underwater scenes were wonderfully done, but the scenes on land were laborious to sit through."
Hailey Bailey sings like a bird. This was a sweet story.. My children loved it.
very surprised. it was similar to the animated version but Halle really did a wonderful job. she is meant to be a princess
I love the storyline the ocean scenery and cast was breathtaking the music was angelic
"Beautiful film, so much nostalgia from the classic film."
I was leery of watching this version but they did a great job!
A tale as old as time. I love the fact there were nods from both the cartoon Disney version and from the Hans Christian Andersen fairy tale. The original music brought me back to my childhood while the new scores kept me falling in love for more. I recommend this 12/10. I’m coming back tomorrow to see it again.
okay movie. they could have done better with the music and the visuals. under the sea could have been done so much better besides the music everything else was on point .
Wish flouder & sebastian wouldve been a little cuter/less real.
so different than original. poor story telling. not a fan of new songs. overall just underwhelming while being very overwhelming
My daughter loved it! 🤍
"I love the movie , such a beautiful story ."
The ending was a little over the top.
halle bailey as ariel is the most magical casting since judy garland as dorothy
Beautiful with some unique songs .
We love every thing abt it. Waiting for past 2
Loved everything about the movie
"Of course, nothing is perfect, but I feel like they captured the idea of the original Little Mermaid. Halle Bailey was amazing as her version of Ariel! Her voice, her portrayal of innocence. Beautiful! Overall, a film that pleased my inner child and I can’t watch it again AND share with my future children."
It was a great remake for a real version of the little mermaid. It spoke clearly to every young little girl to not give up on hope and to encourage family and individual values can be important together versus separate.
It was so boring Im so disappointed
I liked it it was like the cartoon
"Halle Baileys voice was like a real life siren incantation, absolutely amazing!"
"Great movie, great cast, great visuals, just an all-around great movie. My daughter can't wait to watch it again!"
I loved it Halle Bailey was such an amazing Ariel and the whole cast was amazing Melissa as Ursula was also amazing and Jonah as prince Eric I cant say a bad word about it absolutely brilliant
"Little Mermaid was a visual treat, lovely songs written by Manuel Lynn Miranda,always active, emotional, and filled with interesting  inclusiveness.   Color or ethnic background of the characters was irrelevant to the storyline and plot which was refreshing to see..   We  saw it in I max.  It mus be pretty in 3D also."
"Followed the story line. Halles voice is incredible. Featured a cameo of the OG little mermaid, Jodi Benson"
"Halle Bailey was amazing! The graphics, the singing, everything was so good!"
Movie is not original
The cast was good and the musical scenes were great but does not compare to the original (obviously). Would recommend!
Amazing! New added songs but it was so true to the original! I plan to go see it again!
I honestly loved it 💜
I enjoyed the special effects and the story. Disney Disney. Did a great job keeping up with the original cartoon storyline in this movie.Great job with the song choices and the cast.
"I absolutely loved it! The best live action retelling Disney has made to date! The original was my favorite movie growing up and I was so nervous to see this new one because of the let downs the live action remakes have been. Well I am happy to say that I was very pleasantly surprised and impressed! If you’re on the fence, don’t be, go and see it!"
"Magical. Took me back to childhood, It was great."
"Ursula stole the show! Melissa Mcarthy was hands down the best choice IMO. Did I miss a few scenes from the original little mermaid. Of course! Would chef and Sebastians scene added to the film? probably yes! It would have made a fun silly scene. Overall enjoyed the live action LM. Prince Eriks solo was a bit cringy as my son put it. Could have done without but he was a great Prince. The wedding was very anticlimactic, it started and ended so quickly. All in all must watch. Chloe was a great fit and incredibly talented. Her voice was especially touching."
The Little Mermaid was beautiful - I loved it all over again!
The movie was amazing! Halle made a great debut as the Little Mermaid.
Great live action remake. The graphics were amazing. The music was excellent. The storyline was exact with a few additions.
I absolutely loved it took me back to my childhood. I wanted to stand up in the theater and sing all of the songs but my son and husband refused to allow me to do so Absolutely must see
The entire production was magic! Everything came to life so well to depict such a beautiful story. Truly an experience!
"This was beautifully done, by far one of the best live action Disney retelling ever done. Changes made were necessary, and the acting was outstanding. 3D was not used to distract from the story, it really enhanced it. It was funny, emotional, and campy. The visuals were stunning the music was PHENOMENAL, and the story was fully fleshed out. Will be definitely seeing this again."
"Despite that we have an image of what Ariel looks like the movie brought everything out to the best in my opinion, and in 3D even better. Loved it!  It was an amazing Under The Sea lol!"
"Loved the special effects, loved the costumes of the characters, but I feel like the directors could have had a better ending showing prince Eric and Princess Ariel getting married."
Was pretty coo. Love me some fins.
"I read All the complaints about this movie before going so i can see what people were talking about.. yall if anyone says they hate this movie, theyre either lying or havent seen it. So many surprises, laughs and cries the movie has given me.. well done! 
P.S the original little mermaid was amazing, but we have to look at this movie as a separate movie not a remake. Youll enjoy it more!"
Stunningly beautiful! Will be seeing it again!!
This movie was so good!!!
really enjoyed the movie
I loved it all such a great movie me and the family really enjoyed it!!
"My Wife is a huge Little Mermaid fan and she says it was a Great live action, stayed true to the story line. However a few key scenes missing and certain musical changes were alittle different but overall fantastic movie!"
Halle Bailey was so freaking beautiful in this. The chemistry between Jonah and her was so GOOOOOD. Melissa also actually impressed she was awesome.
love it !!! reminded me of my childhood and now my girls
The graphics was amazing
Waited my whole life for this. It was so beautiful!
love the movie love seeing it come to life
Kept the story but added elements of comedy much needed
"great movie, I'm not a fan of Disney live action movies, but this one was well done"
It was perfect! It followed the original movie with a few add ons
"The beauty love story with live actors really brought this magical world to life.  There were funny moments, sad moments and joyous moments.  I loved this movie from start to finish."
Very good adaptation/interpretation of the original version. Visually beautiful
Loved it!!! I was engaged the whole time. Great work and production!
Little Mermaid is of my favorite Disney princesses. This movie did not disappoint. The cinematography was exceptional. The song were good and everyone in the movie was beautiful.
Halle was outstanding the cast acted well. The music was uplifting and just as good as the original. What 2023 needed. A must see. Did I mention Halles voice pure magic!
Loved the movie. Halle did an amazing job and I loved Sebastian!! 10/10
"The music was amazing and just about brought tears to my eyes. I loved every second and could not stop smiling. I could not see anyone else playing a live action Ariel, she was perfect!"
"It was amazing, loved the new mermaid and all the singing."
The characters how they seemed so real
"They did an amazing job with casting (including the diversity), keeping essential parts from the original, and incorporating different scenes to create a movie to reflect the times… Halle deserves all of her flowers and awards. Her vocals were amazing!!! Anyone who said the movie was good is a hater!"
"A fresh new take on my favorite Disney princess!!!! All cast members did a fantastic job, with Halle Bailey and Melissa McCarthys performances standing out."
"The movie was awesome, contrary to what reviewers said before it came out. Liked it better than the cartoon!"
Not that good on the singing
I love the Little Mermaid and the humor in it!
"3 year old me was crying at this movie- 
First off the ocean and colors in the movie were amazing! I like how they added some songs and updated others. Honestly I love how they were able to stay true to the original but still make it their own! ALSO LOVE HOW THEY SNUCK IN A SCENE WITH THE ORIGINAL LITTLE MERMAID!"
Amazing movie! Halle Bailey is a perfect Ariel and Melissa McCarthy slayed as Ursula.
Awesome remake. Ursula was the highlight and Ariel did an amazing job.
"loved 😍 it 
Kiss the Girl and Sébastien was a hit Under the Sea 
loved the graphics of all the sea life! 
Haley was amazing as Ariel just perfection!!!
Prince Eric can sing!!!
Melissa McCarthy was perfect as Ursula"
Loved the incorporating of the Jamaican accents
I really enjoyed it with my seventeen year old daughter. Good fun
The movie was really good. I'm 40. Enjoyed it.
it was less than mid.  Go see this when it's not full priced.
So happy to see someone look like me. I love Ariel!
Exceeded my expectations. Might have to go back and watch again!
"So much of the Essence of the real Little Mermaid was lost. Im disappointed. The movie could have been better and had the potential to wow but it didn’t. However, Melissa did a great job with Ursula. My 8 year old got bored and my husband fell asleep."
amazing movie it's the best live action Disney movie to date Halle Bailey cooked!!
"I like the idea that the little mermaid is black and I also like the cinematography picture and vibrant colors of the scenes. 

I didnt like how the mother of the prince is close minded as far as the prince liking a girl like Ariel as well as the fact that The princes mom doesnt seem like his mom because it takes away from reality but everything else was great."
"la mejor película que eh visto. la Amé, me recordó mi niñez. Los actores estuvieron fantasticos. Que puedo decir, lo mejor. llore desde principio a fin. Para esta película le doy no 5 sino 100000000000000000 🌟 estrellas
the best movie i've ever seen.  I loved it, it reminded me of my childhood.  The actors were fantastic.  What can I say, the best.  I cried from start to finish.  For this movie I give not 5 but 100000000000000000 🌟 stars"
"It takes skill to go from animation to live action. it takes the great abiility of the writers to take a film created in another decade snd make it up to date and culturally appropriate with our society now. And it takes artistic creativity to bring to life characters that that we fell in love with from years past. I think the animators, the writers, the actors, and the musicians dis an amazing job!! How to do make mermaids real? I'd say given all the knowledge, skills, and abilities we possess now, Disney did an absolutely wonderful job with how they portrayed Ariel and Eric and Ursala, and all the characters that gave their all for this film. If you don't like the story, or the graphics, or the casting, do it yourself 😊"
The graphics and Halle’s singing were truly breathtaking! Very humorous as well. I loved it.
Such a wonderful movie! I’m so happy for Halle Bailey. Follow me on twitter I have art for you! @cfellathegreat
Everything was amazing!!!
"I've been waiting for this for so long. The Little Mermaid was the first movie I remember seeing in the theater as a child, so this was so special to me! Halle was phenomenal, Awkwafina as Scuttle was an excellent choice. Lin-Manuel Miranda's new songs fit right in with the rest of the originals. And Melissa's Ursula.... I have no words to describe how completely perfect she was for this part. 

As a lifelong Little Mermaid fan, I absolutely love this movie. Anyone upset about it is just trying to start unnecessary drama. 

I also loved the Jodi cameo. 🤌🏻"
I loved Halle and the way she portrayed this roll!
100/10 highly recommended 🥳
"It was brought to life in a new exiting way. This is one of my new favorite movies from Disney. I love the fact that Disney at times goes against what ""some people might not like"". We are all different, and it should celebrated, Disney definitely got this right. I will likely see this movie again and buy it too when available. Both of my kids LOVED IT TOO."
Halle was absolutely beautiful! I wanted to was hear her sing whenever she wasn't. I watched the new Little Mermaid in 3D and was so glad I did. Extremely well done visuals.
I will give it a 8/10 pretty good
They didn’t put the chef scene so 4 stars.
"An absolute delight of a live action! Halle shines in her role as Ariel, as do the rest of the cast. It was vibrant, fun, and heartwarming. Disney’s best live action thus far."
"Loved the music, the characters, and the underwater scenes."
This movie was absolutely everything. Iconic. And I was tearing up. 10/10
I loved Halle Bailey’s voice!  It is so incredible!
Loved the representation and the swag
"I loved it from beginning to end. A reminder of what Disney movies should be like, true fairytales, far off lands, beautiful songs. Every member was perfectly cast. Adds just enough to the original to make it it’s own. Truly can’t find much wrong with it."
Love everything about it!!!
The run time was too long for little children
Loved this movie so much! It was so beautiful! Ariel is absolutely perfect! She is the cartoon character personified! Prince Eric is also a great choice.
"I liked it, all the colors were fun. The original was still way better."
"Flounder, and Sebastian could’ve been more animated and they could’ve used a better actor for the father of Ariel and the boyfriend, but aside from that the movie was fantastic"
Graphics were a disappointment. But very true to the classical storyline.
If you have young daughters or nieces this is a great film to take them to go see. Fun time for the kids!
"The movie was absolutely incredible! The storyline, the music, the actors, and even the CGI! It was truly incredible!"
Halle Baileys performance was incredible!
Halle Bailey did an excellent job as Ariel both in her acting and singing.  I love the new music arrangements and liberties taken. I love the new cultural experience I had with this movie. My only negative remark would be that I felt like Disney missed something in the ending.
SLAY LIKE BIG MAJOR SLAY
It was just as amazing as the animated version
"amazing visuals, kids loved it 🧚🏽‍♀️🥳"
We loved it! New songs and the script was different from the original. I only wish theyd included Chef Louis.
Enjoyed the whole plot.
She stoleeeeeee the entire movie  loved every minute!!!
Literally so beautiful and nostalgic!! 5/5! Well done!!
"I really liked the movie, better than the animated ones. For me best Little Mermaid movie. As for the theater it would be nice if parents repected other individuals when they take their children to the movies (don't let them run loose and monitor their talking) it was bothersome. If parents aren't taking charge then the theater should do something about it."
I had to weave and didnt get a refund
Loved every minute! So did my daughters!
I loved everything about this movie. The fact that it was all races and ethnicities was amazing
"Gorgeous movie! Well cast and the songs were great. I couldnt wait to see it, and in 3D!! Ursula is one of my all time Disney villains. Melissa McCarthy was brilliant. Haille Bailey gave a heartfelt performance as Ariel. I loved Aquafina as Scuttle was one of my favorites in this.Nothing negative to say. My first time to but tickets in advance. Easy once I got the app to work."
Awful. Horrible CGI.
Very very cute movie!!!! I loved it!
"Love that it was a live movie, and it had its own twist to it."
Overall great movie to watch.
This movie was wonderful. It shows how a parent love is so strong that we know deep down we have to let go and allow them to live their own lives.
even better than i thought!!
"Disney did it once again. I believe this is the best live action adaptation they’ve had in quite a long time. The movie definitely lived up to the hype prior to its release. Halle portrayed Ariel perfectly, she was made for that role and rightfully deserved it. I was pleasantly surprised by Ursula and Prince Eric, they did a wonderful job as well. Please take your families to see this and ignore the noise from all of the ignorant critics who downplayed the movie from the beginning."
"It was cute! The acting wasnt that great, but the kids didnt notice. Definitely should have waited to watch it on Disney+"
Beautiful in every way. Fresh but also knows how to pay homage to the og
I Loved everything about it!!
It was sooooooo much better than the animated version!!! And the 3D was spot on!!! Kudos to Disney!!!!!!!
This move was amazing for all ages it was a good spin on the little mermaid that still stayed on the storyline.
It stayed to the story line. The music was fantastic
I love my mermaid !!!
It was an entertaining movie really peaked interests and keep to the same plot of the original movie.
Excellent remake!! The whole family enjoyed it
"Pro: Loved the new Ariel! She can sing beautifully. Loved how they made this diverse! 

Con: Could have eliminated 2 of the new songs they added. Other than that I love the new version!"
Nostalgia!!! Both myself and my kid loved it! Im going back to see it without kids lol!
The movie was amazing I loved it
"Absolutely WONDERFUL! The singing, graphics, EVERYTHING! Definitely see it in 3D. They did a great job on the remake and I'll probably be back to see it again. BRAVO!"
Great movie. I saw the first version of A Little Mermaid and wanted to see what the Live Action version was like. Loved this version much better. The Cinema photography was amazing. Costumes amazing visual effects amazing. Makeup amazing. Acting amazing. Music was amazing sound effect amazing. Loved the story. A+
IT WAS AMAZING GOD. IT WAS EVERYTHING PLUS MORE
Great movie I cried at the end
"Loved it. Amazing singing, acting and beautiful scenery. Stayed true to the one made in my childhood"
I loved with my family tonight
"It was beautiful ... I have three little girls and they enjoyed everything. It was funny, it was genuine, and of course the singing was amazing. Great cast."
Absolutely loved it! Just go see for yourself! Halle was amazing! Melissa Mc did her thing as always! Loved the music and the acting was on point. A few memorable surprises to add to the nostalgia. Beautiful cg. Go and enjoy a great movie!
"Very well done!! Cast, graphics, music! All Great!!"
I really enjoyed it and would highly recommend it to others to see it. I think there were some songs missing from it but other than that I would definitely see it again.
"Absolutely loved this movie. Likely my top favorite in terms of Disney live actions. Can't wait to see it again. Halle's voice is simply amazing. Exceeded my expectations, by far."
Exceeded any expectations I thought I had😍
"Amazing movie, bravo! 10’s 10’z 10’s across the board. 👏🏾😁"
Great movie!!!! 10-10
I paid for seating during the movie I got moved by a family that had the same seating as me. We eventually moved down to the the bottom without a problem. The movie sorta scared my daughter she couldnt sit in the seat comfortably so we ended up leaving in the middle of the movie.
Loved the music and the story.
This movie was amazing halle killed it as my sister name other half.
"Beautiful cinematography, fantastic talent, some parts felt unnecessary, but overall a wonderful remake."
Loved every second the graphics were so beautiful!!!
I laughed and oddly almost cried.. it was beautiful...
"Terrible!!! I left early I believe it was at the part where they began “Kiss the Girl”. No more live action movies of Disney animated classics, Disney! Please! This movie was such torture. I wasn’t mad that I spent money to leave early I was at a point where I would pay additional money to leave early."
Haley Bailey was superb in this Disney.  I love that she was allowed to use her natural hair and not a wig to transform her to look like the animated character
I loved it. Al the actresses did an amazing job.
I loved that Ariel is the hero!  Great movie adaptation!!
THE WHOLE MOVIE WAS PHENOMENAL
OMG!!!!! Melissa and Halle CARRIED that ENTIRE movie!!!! That was the first time I REFUSED to get up and take anyone to the bathroom!!!! 😱 😂 It brought back SO many childhood memories!!!!! Best movie of the year!!!!!!!!!!! 💕🧜‍♀️ 🐠 🐙 THANK YOU DISNEY!!!!
"The animation, costumes, music/musicians, reenactment, all around creativity, ACTORS/ACTRESSES.. Excellent!!"
"I was skeptical at first, but this movie did not disappoint. Her voice was amazing. Perfect casting for Ursula."
loved loved loved it!! it was too cute 🧜🏽‍♀️
really good movie. Did a great job with the romance between Eric and Ariel.
Just stunning visuals and beautiful voices
Halle Bailey did a beautiful job in playing her assigned character. Her voice as well as her performance were absolutely flawless.
Such an amazing movie! Already planning to see it again. Wow!!
"Beautiful Movie, with singing and action. A familt must see movie of the Summer"
"Beautiful. Fun new songs and once flounder is talking and swimming, he doesn’t look creepy at all. Loved it. Super well done"
"This was an amazing movie!!! The graphics, the cast, the song choices, the vibrant colors, the storyline. Just absolutely beautiful!!!"
I absolutely loved this movie.
I look that she was a very good actress
"Amazing! Didn’t know it would be so romantic. Ariel and Eric. Gah! The visual effects seemed a little off at times, but not enough to detract from the rest of the movie. Loved the Caribbean vibe. Just wonderful."
"Halle Bailey was made for this role. Her voice is absolutely beautiful, I didn't want her to stop singing! Her acting was perfect for Ariel. The chemistry between Jonah and Halle brought me to tears. The movie is so colorful, so magical, and definitely a must-see. I felt like I was in the ocean too! The diversity in the film made the little girl in me so happy. I found myself smiling the entire time. It was definitely worth the wait."
I thought it was great. I mean there's not much more you can say about it. It was just really good
Really good likes it
Loved everything about it! 10/10
Just wait till it drops on Disney+
This movie was excellent and the 4xD was a great addition to the movie experience
Another failed live action. Enough said. Main girl can sing though.
Loved every bit of it. Finally a little black girl get a chance to shine
"It was absolutely fantastic! The original Little Mermaid came out when I was 7 years old and it was a fantastic film back then. I was not certain that they could do this remake to be good or better than the original and it absolutely was. The imagery they through in here with so many different cultures and nationalities couldn't have told a better message of ""love is love"". My 13 year old and 10 year old loved it - and it was even better that we saw it 4D in the theatre with the moving seats."
"liked the cast, but didn't like the CGI very fake."
Great movie. The added elements have more depth to characters and the entire cast was great. A movie you will be happy watching and smiling throughout the entire film.
"This movie was done perfectly! 

- born 1989 and obsessed with the original"
"It was a really pleasant film, ended up being beautiful (the lighting was NOT an issue), and Halle Bailey was wonderful"
Loved the message of blending different cultures and different races in harmony !!
"Amazing! The graphics, the beautiful Halle as Ariel, Melissa are that performance, Jonah and Halle’s chemistry… all of it was just amazing. 10 out of 10 recommend!!!! Daveed Diggs’s accent could use A LOT of work, but it was too terrible! Loved it! It brought my childhood to life."
I loved this movie and would recommend it to anyone with a family. I can’t wait to buy it on DVD
It followed the cartoon very close but it was very good.
"The movie stayed true to the classic while adding new elements that only enhanced the story we know and love. Halle was PHENOMENAL. The animation was great. If you love the original, youll absolutely love this!"
Amazing!! Everything was phenomenal!!
"The movie was great! Stuck to the original story, while also making it its own. Made a background story for Eric, which was awesome. The only reason that it wasn’t a 5 star is because the underwater CGI on the mermaids looked weird. Made Ariel look off as she was swimming, but once she was out of the water she was beautiful! Would definitely watch again!"
"I absolutely love the movie and the ending it was amazing the music and rapping was excellent love the characters and creativity, The crab and the pelican is funny!"
Loved the songs and music.  I thought the movie was great for live action
"The whole movie was awesome, but that rapping bird had me bouncing to the music.."
I loved everything about the movie. I enjoyed myself and so did the children. We sang all the sounds we knew.
I absolutely loved it. It is a must see!
"Absolutely amazing! The entire theater erupted in applause at the end, it was so good. Definitely recommend!"
10/10 Disney’s best live action remake! Halle Bailey is THE LITTLE MERMAID.
"Beautiful singing, stunning visuals, and very believable acting. Followed the original story well but with a few new or updated scenes that were moving or just a lot of fun. Really enjoyed this movie!"
"I really liked the movie! Very cute and definitely brings back good memories. I like the few additions and changes. I believe the actors did a good job, especially Ursula she was truly the live representation of the cartoon version. I found the movie entertaining and well made."
"My niece dance the whole entire movie, she is 4! We had a great time."
loved it! I felt like a kid again.
It was true to the Disney movie and it was REFRESHING to see Halle Bailey as Ariel! Representation MATTERS!
"Loved it! Ariel has always been my favorite, seeing as a live action has been amazing!"
"Movie was really great! Kept us all interested the whole time, and the storyline was just like the original. Only downside is  Just the part where Ursula turned into the huge sea monster and really scared my kids! Not sure the at pet was pg."
"The movie held your attention and was well cast All the kids were watching,clapping and having a good time."
"Disney has done it yet again, such a cute movie, absolutely loved it."
Great rendition of the original! Absolutely loved it !
"Very good movie. A bit long for some of the younger movie goers, but everyone seemed to enjoy it."
Visibility is IMPORTANT!💙 This was healing to my inner child!
This movie was amazing!  Halle and the entire cast was great!!
"Beautiful, loved the diversity of the cast.  Such a feel good movie.  Music and singing was good."
"It is the first live action movie that is better than the animated original!  They changed it into a better story, and the colors are beautiful!"
10/10 would recommend
"it was good, don't know if id watch it again. But my daughter and neices enjoyed it."
"Loved the movie! Perfect casting, followed along comparably with the cartoon version."
Phenomenal singing in the movie and Melissa McCarthey absolutely killed it as Ursula. It was an amazing re-imagination of the little mermaid.
Halle Bailey ate that right on up!!
I loved the quality of the movie! The New Little Mermaid is a MUST WATCH FOR SURE!!!! ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT!!!!! 😍😍💗💗💗
"Saw it again this time with my mother, and we both loved it!"
"Excellent!!! The audience clapped, sang along, and cheered at the end."
Blown away by the beauty and creativity of the original brought to new life. Simply magical! So much laughter and tears of joy. This was my favorite movie as a young girl and I couldnt believe how much they were able to bring the scenes to life.
"Movie was exceptional and a fresh take on the original. it was just different enough to keep the audience captivated, while paying enough homage to the original to offer the right amount of nostalgia."
Love it! This was a great movie for me and my daughter.
Absolutely amazing movie!  I loved the additions it was nostalgic.  Halle was phenomenal!!
Really enjoy the movie ! It was very entertaining and sweet! My whole family enjoyed it too.
It was an absolutely wonderful movie
Amazing very well done
10/10 movie !! I caught all the vibes !!
It was beautiful! The characters were gorgeous and talented! 100% would watch over and over!
An amazing new take on my forever favorite! This is a movie I’ll watch more than once for sure 🙌🏽
"I don’t know how or why but I feel like I enjoyed that just as much if not more than the original and that was my favorite movie growing up. Halle did amazing, everyone was amazing."
Took my daughter to see it just like my mom did me. We loved it!
The seats was not working that was assigned to us but movie was Great
"Loved every minute, not for little kids , I wouldn’t take my 4 yr old grandchild, a Little Scary"
"Great filming, beautiful underwater scenes. Nice music
A little slow"
I didnt y think they would pull it off but hey they pulled off beauty and the beast  I loved every minute of it
Definitely a much watch. Different take on the first one.
Truly relived my own Little Mermaid experience.
Awesome! A great version of a favorite story!
"Amazing, Happy I got to watch it with my baby girl!"
I really liked it! it's one of the better live action remake. I wanted more Ursula but that's what I say about the animated one. I wish the father daughter relationship was stronger and the under the sea song was underwhelming. All in all I can't wait to watch it over and over and over on the app.
Awesome movie and cast!!!
"Went in a little skeptical,  but we ended up absolutely loving it!! So glad we saw the 3D version too. So good!!"
This movie was amazing!!! The additions definitely helped carry the storyline and the visuals were astoundinghad that Disney magic
Wow. Amazing visuals and lovely music. Will see it again for sure in IMAX.
Excellent movie! The cast was outstanding. Really liked that they stuck to the original storyline.
"Halle was the best thing about this movie! I was also pleasantly surprised at how much I liked Sebastian and scuttle too! Jonah as Eric was a delight as well! Overall a really fun and colorful watch, something both kids and adults can enjoy. I will be watching it again this weekend :)"
Awesome movie and Halle kills it every time.
"The adults loved the memories and the new twists from Lin Manuel, the kids loved the whole story and the mermaids."
The movie was amazing! Halle Bailey truly embodied Ariel! The ending had me in tears! Melissa McCarthy’s Ursula was spot on and hilarious! Shuttle and Sebastian were a great duo. The movie was beautiful and made me want to go to the beach! Can’t wait to see it again!
"This movie was absolutely amazing and beautiful. Halle has such a beautiful, mesmerizing voice it truly makes the movie incredible. The way Ariel and Eric interact and cater to each others interests despite Ariel not being able to speak is very admirable. I hope the movie gets a sequel."
AMAZING- the best live-action Disney movie yet!!!
This movie isn’t ONE of the best live action films….it IS the BEST live action film Disney has ever done. They did so good by paying homage to the original and Hans while also giving us new scenes. Cinderella has been dethroned!!
great movie. dedicated to the kids and principal  to the Family.  nothing behind or hidden nothing  that kids ate ot suppost to see.
"Extremely faithful to the animated film. Chills when Hailey sings! No after credits 😞 Run, don’t walk to see this"
Didnt like some of the new songs
it was an amazing movie halle is beautiful so is the prince
It was a beautiful movie clear soundtrack was amazing
"It made me want to watch it many times, love the new songs as well!!"
Absolutely wonderful! There were old songs and new songs but they kept the heaat and theme of the original. I loved it and my kids loved it. May be too much for toddlers and preschoolers but great overall.
Good music and cast.
"My niece was amazed and she’s tough to please, still talking about it😊"
"The music, vocal work of Halle Bailey and additional story behind Prince Eric made me enjoy this movie in a way I did not care for as much as the original. It wasn’t perfect, but it worked great in the ways that mattered."
"Excellent movie, very well done. Maybe a little long for younger kids."
I love it everything was great about the movie
Sooo beautiful! I LOVE the new touches to the movie. Second time going to see it and it was just as beautiful as the first time! I may go again !
EVERYONE GO SEE THIS MOVIE
Great movie! Watch it!!
It was a fun movie. I liked how they explained certain things to make the live action version flow. Great cinematography.
Great update of a childhood classic
The Perfect choice for Ariel definitely want to have this movie in my collection
"Incredible cast! Halle Bailey is a Superstar.. I feel this is the only Disney live action movie where the additions to the story actually work to better and enhance the film. The chemistry between Ariel and Eric is magical. Just sit back and enjoy the ride, you’ll have a good time"
Great story line!! I
"Beautifully made, it had all of the elements that I love from the original and more!"
"Some of the acting could have been better, but with that being said it was enjoyable. Very nostalgic knowing that I was 5 yrs old when the original came out, and now I’m here with my kids. I think Halle did great with the singing!"
It was great but it would be better if when the rain or the storm come in you can throw a little water and that was a dumb way to tell him her name but ok it WAS STILL A GREAT MOVIE
it is 90% the same story which is fine I think they could have done a bit better but I enjoyed it
I love love loved every single moment! I laughed I cried. Bravo Disney! To the haters: keep that negative BS to yourself!!!
Omggg the acting and singing was amazing
"INCREDIBLE movie!! Halle was PERFECT as Ariel. She was literally made for The Little Mermaid. The whole thing was so visually appealing, music was amazing, Lin-Manuel Miranda always does a superb job with the music/scripting.. The storyline didn’t stray at all from the original. I cried 3 times. Such a full circle moment for me, as The Little Mermaid was the first movie I ever saw as a child when it first came out in the 80s. As a Blk woman at 38, seeing a Blk Ariel— especially one who delivers made me emotional. Run to go see this! You won’t regret it! Exceptional work by Disney."
I really liked my experience with my husband it was my birthday and yall are where I decided to spend part of it.
I love the fact that this movie was so real. I love the fact that this movie was so real. I love the fact that Melissa McCarthy played a bad character. I love that it was so many different races for so many different characters.. I love that it was so many different races for so many different characters.
"This was a really great rendition! I wish that my daughter would have had access to this type of representation as a child, but I was super happy to see it with her now as an adult"
"Although they changed some things about it, overall it didnt worsen the story at all. The songs were amazing! I loved it! I hope they make another one! Please go see it!"
I loved it so much they killed it
Beautiful presentation! On point with the animated version with a little well done extras.
Love the representation!!!! Needed so much in society!
AMAZING!!! 3D really brought it to life for me!
It was a beautifully told story and the visuals were awesome!
"Not afraid to lean on the original, but has very fresh and clearer takes on the motives of the characters. Visual effects are STUNNING and most of the actors/voice work is spot on! Halle is BRILLIANT as Ariel."
Loved it!! Id say the only negative for me was Erics song. Snooze fest. But the rest of the movie was great and everything was so colorful and beautiful
"There was literally only one small thing I didnt like. And that was after Ariel saved him from dying, he sang a song. They couldve left that part out. Other than that, I absolutely loved it."
"beautiful, love the concept"
"Stayed true to the original. Brought my 5 year old daughter, she liked it. A+"
"Great cast,great spin on a classic Disney movie!!! Would definitely see it again(another 100xs)"
I didn't even watch it
Awesome remake!!!! I loooove the subtle changes and diversity. It was amazing. Theater gave an applause at the end 👏🏽
"Loved it ! Cried , laughed and fell in love with Ariel all over again ! It’s a must see !"
"The movie was phenomenal! The direction of the film was beautiful, and the slightly updated musical arrangements were nostalgic as well as modern. Amazing film! Melissa McCarthy is a star. Pity to the poor unfortunate soul who misses this in theatres!"
I love the movie because its interracial its about time Disney got it right and all the music was perfect time for unity and peace
Halle Bailey is a wonder! this was a magical new telling of the classic and the new babies will be enamored by this movie for years to come
"Very well done, don’t understand the criticism."
Gorgeous cinematography.  Fabulous acting.  Beautiful story from start to finish!!
"Wonderful movie!  Halle Bailey was terrific as Ariel.
A must see!"
"I thought it was ok. I was hoping my 5 yr old would enjoy it, but unfortunately she did not. She wanted to go home in the middle of it. We both agreed that it started out very slow, then got more interesting more towards the end of the movie."
"Loved this movie! Stayed true to the animated story overall. The music was great, new songs were great, costumes were wonderful and actresses and actors did a great job!"
music was amazing! #SCUTTLEBUTT
"It was incredibly faithful to the Disney classic. The CG effects were a bit iffy in places. Of the new songs, I liked 2 out of 3. There were some tweaks to song lyrics that I heard about and didn't notice. Changes made to the characters were appreciated. The run-time made sense, in theory, but it for sure ran long. It's not replacing the original animated feature, but as far as the live-action adaptations go, it's one of the better ones as of late."
The singing was cute!
Great retelling of a well known story the only negative for me was some o f the singing was not the best. Actor and singers are not always interchangeable.
Most of the original parts were in it plus additional songs!
Different races than  the original made it seem less authentic but it was an AMAZING movie . Gave me chills and reminded me of my childhood. The humor was great .
I loved it I recommend 3d but do your thing ‼️ it was amazing
it was beautiful and magically done!!!
I love the movie it was great. I like the characters the storyline. Its just a great movie and I was pleased to see an African-American young woman playing the role of Ariel.
Omg  great movie love it.
Great music! Loved the new scenes!
"The Little Mermaid was very good. I liked the whole movie, even the new songs were good!"
The first movie my parents took me to as a kid was the original. Now its not the first Ive taken my kid to but I did take her and I absolutely loved it! Brought back my childhood and the love of family is so important.
I love the animation and the acting the most. You can tell a lot of work went into making this movie. My kids and I loved it!
Absolutely amazing!! Halle Bailey is the next generational talent the world needed.. It sucks many audiences won’t give this a chance because they won’t be able to get past her skin color—their lost. This movie is an instant classic!
"Beautiful voice, lovely scenes and loved the modernization of Ariel and the story."
"I am not a fan of the little mermaid but this remake..It was hilarious! Beautiful! Amazing, and I already want to see again!!!"
Amazing!!!! We loved it!!!
Slow. Nothing special
It was a refreshing take on a Disney classic. Very nice to see the film industry pushing towards more diversity and this movie was obviously sending a clear message of people coming together for a more inclusive world.
Absolutely Great movie
"In order to enjoy this movie, you have to remove the cartoon out your head. That movie was made in 1989. It is 2023. 

Allow what the creators did to captivate you instead of doing a side by side comparison of every detail. This movie was great. I will be seeing it again."
10/10 definitely would recommend!!
It’s magical yet a little long. Halle is a superstar
"Im usually terrified of live action renditions of classic 
animated movies. But I absolutely loved this one!"
It was perfect!!! Casting was perfect! Such a special movie
"I'm not a fan of the story line of Little Mermaid, but this was well done. Loved the beautiful scenery, new songs, and Caribbean flare."
"Great Movie, Great Storyline , adventurous . funny, heart touching"
Greatest movie ever it was my first experience with 3-D and I absolutely loved it
Hailey did an Awesome performance!! This role was written just for her and she deserves every accolade!!
I loved it and all the diversity!!!
"The movie was great from what I could hear if it. If it wasn’t for the rude, inconsiderate family sitting behind us talking and cursing the whole time it would have been a great experience."
It was a little too long IMO.  There could have been at least 15-20 minutes shaved off.  Melissa McCarthy is fantastic as Ursula as she took the role and ran with it.  Hallie Bailey is a star and she shines brightly.  Akwafina is good in small doses but way too much here and please no more singing from her.    Bring your kids and have a good time.
We love every moment of the movie!
Very well done!!! Highly recommend!
"I love the new live of the Little Mermaid. it's so much compared to the original animated movie, but different and new. the cast who played the characters, they're fantastic. Absolutely fantastic compared to the live Beauty and the Beast."
The best live action from Disney plus Halle can saaaang!!
So good. I wasn’t sure if I was going to like it but it did don’t disappoint at all!!
Loved it. Better than the original.
Movie was amazing I loved everything about brought me back to my childhood. Us black girls are princess too
The photography was superb.  Storyline and actors did an amazing job.  Five stars!!
"Diverse Characters were nice to see and action was great throughout, Fun time with my teen."
tlm live action made the inner child in me cry 💕
Great movie. Some slow parts but overall we enjoyed it!
"Angelic little mermaid. Absolutely amazing casting, acting, and singing."
"Very good movie,  quality screen view"
great movie Ursula and Ariel were amazing and great numbers with the sea creatures.
Halle Bailey was amazing as Ariel! The movie was the best live action by far.
Loved it! Every actor knocked it out of the park!! Will see it again soon!
Good live rendition (always a fan of the mermaid)
"Yes, cgi and lighting were tough in some spots and especially in the last act but the efforts were there. Halle Bailey is a delight whether you agree with her physical attributes or not. She embodies Ariel’s spirit and her voice is gorgeous. Not to mention best mermaid tail and movement in any show or movie. Film is not perfect, few characters are one dimensional and contributed very little but it’s not as disastrous as some people hoped it would be. Go in with an open mind and heart, it’s a fun homage to the animated version."
"This is a fantastic movie to watch. The singing was marvelous, and each character was great.  It displayed action, sadness, and happiness. You may tear up a time or two, but you can breathe a sigh of relief in the end."
"Bes
t movie everyone yeah quality was on point"
I liked everything about this movie. I recommend seeing it in digital 3D.
"I was a little skeptical and nervous at first however, Disney did not disappoint.  There were a couple of cringy scenes but overall a good movie.  Great acting and singing while giving a new age taste."
"I understand that reboots of these films usually arent the greatest, but this absolutely exceeded my expectations in every way. The added material was a nice touch of depth to the story and Halle embodies Ariel so beautifully. Disney has gotten this one right (finally)! Bravo!"
The movie was really great
Amazing from beginning to end
"The graphics were beautiful, music awesome, and the diversity was spectacular. Sea witch could be a little scary for younger ones. I saw a few dads put little girls in their lap during several scenes."
Disney did an amazing job!  Must see
I absolutely loved this movie. It was such a beautiful thing to be able to see this with my daughters. Had my attention from beginning to end and will most likely see it again!
I loved the movie. It was a wonderful remake. Hailee and the rest of the actors did a great job. Lil Mermaid is my all time favorite Disney Princess!
"Easily one of the Best Disney Live action remakes. Casting was great, music was awesome, story was well done.   My only critique is that the visuals underwater were a little off somehow. If you are going to bring sea creatures to life, go the little extra."
Very good movie kid friendly
GREAT feel of nostalgia for sure. Halle Bailey really shines in this movie!
"I really enjoyed it! I just missed the one song/ scene that was omitted. But other than that, it was done really well and I'm so glad I went to see it!"
well donelove the pace of how the movie played
Very good all the way through and the end was amazing. Took our 8 year old for her birthday and it was a blast. Under The Sea!!!
"Very beautiful Film. It make me laugh, smile and cry. I really enjoyed the new songs. I totally recommend this movie to friends and Family."
The graphics were amazing! We watched it in IMAX. It was great to see a diverse cast.
So many positive messages!
I loved that the script stayed close to the Original… The actors were brilliant… the Jamaican accent not so much…
It’s an amazing movie to experience as live 🤍🤍🤍
Very entertaining! Another feel good Disney movie!
"it was great! I was trying to compare to the 1st one, but this one is on its own a good heartfelt movie.   Loved Bardeem, Akwafina and the Sebastian actor was hilarious"
"Halle is the PERFECT Ariel, every time she said I started tearing up. She has a beautiful voice. Her acting is great, she really brought Ariel’s character to life. Jonah was also an amazing Prince Eric, their chemistry was great! Overall, the movie was very good and cute. I want to go watch it again!"
The moving was awesome! The details were spot on in my opinion and my little people loved every moment!
Nothing to dislike. It was perfect
"A nice, funny and wholesome movie. Enjoyed the musical numbers and story progression. Solid casting job."
AMAZING!!! Everything!!!! Woo Hoooo!!
"It was fine. OK even. There’s literally no “Magic” in these live actions. Halle was great, Melissa as Ursula was better than expected but mannnn I wish the Realism in the animals will GO AWAY. Also the new Lin Miranda songs were awful!!!"
"Excellent movie, loved it"
"Went with an open mind, not assuming that it will be scene to scene like the animated film. It was comedic, moving and whimsical. Definitely going to watch again. The music is great. It is a very good film on its own without comparing it to the classic. Separate entities."
A must see! Had me in tears.. it’s everything we need to experience
I loved that the original songs were sung along with plot. I also really loved the additional parts that added to the story. I really amazingly well done movie that highly respected the animation.
"The special effects were beyond amazing the story was very similar to the original but toward the end this new one brought me to tearsone scene showed that no matter how different we look from each other, love and mutual respect joins us all together. This movie gives us hope that we can overcome any obstacle together. Sometimes fantasy can indeed reflect reality. Bravo, Disney!"
"My family went to see the little mermaid today with Halle Bailey. My daughter really enjoyed the movie. She has only seen the cartoon version that was previous released. It was nice to see a realistic movie with such diversity.

Personally, the only thing I did not like in the movie was flounder, wasnt really not yellow."
beautiful movie for all ages.
Super cute interpretation of a fairy tale. The actors were perfect for the roles they played. I really enjoyed it.
The Little Mermaid was a gorgeous colorful movie that we enjoyed from start to finish. The underwater scenes beat my expectations and the actors were all brilliant.
This brought me back to my childhood! And I actually loved all of the changes that were made to make the story make more sense.
Awesome took me back to my childhood
Loved the movie were going to see it again.
My daughter says it was so cool!
This was the sweetest movie!  Our entire family enjoyed it and I am sure that we will watch it again on Disney+
A wonderful version of a classic!
Must see. Excellent story!
Was a very good movie.  My kids loved it.  Sebastian was to funny.  Def recommend to other family's
I had the opportunity of catching a morning movie and this movie was absolutely magical.
"Took my granddaughter 6 years old and my daughter, It was entertainment for all of us, movie made well."
Halle was incredible!  Beautiful production!!
Visually stunning. Perfect casting. A new favorite from Disney.
We loved it!!! Must see
The best Disney remake!!!!!
"Was so glad we went !  Movie was a 10 out of 10!  
Theater was also amazing!"
Halle has an amazing voice. She and Melissa McCarthy were awesome!
This movie had the theater laughing and singing. I really enjoyed every minute and I left the theater with a big smile. When it ended the whole theater applauded. The only negative were the dark underwater scenes. I give this movie a A.
Loved it. Very lively and fun to watch.  Great performance by all actors involved. Great chemistry between lead actors. Cant wait to watch it again.
the music and effects were so magically beautiful. Loved it💙🥰
"it was everything i thought it would be . great cast, music was great. Love the cgi"
Loved it. Halle was perfect
It was perfect! A beautiful homage to the original Disney movie. The casting is amazing!  Will definitely see again!
"The graphics, music, and actors/actresses were amazing!"
I liked the added songs to help tell the storyline! Great job! Sebastian was the best!!! I loved that there was more of a Caribbean feel to the story! Love love love!!!
Loved the beautiful graphics and storyline
Very good movie shame on anyone who pre judged it my wife and children enjoyed it also!
The best Little Mermaid amazing great job Halle
The movie was great! I love the storyline.
Definitely the best live-action Disney remake to date. Thoroughly enjoyed it!
It is a great movie. Millennials is going to appreciate it more.
Too much singing. Too much drama for a child.
I LOVED Halle Bailey as Ariel! The cast was multi-racial and it was wonderful to see! It tool me back to mu childhood and seeing the original animated version. I was singing along and everything. It put a smile on my face. I'm glad they chose my birthday to bring it out. Happy Birthday to me!!! 🥳✌🏼💜🧜‍♂️🧜🏽‍♀️👷🦤🦀🐙🐚🪸
It's was wondering i love it so much
This movie was great
"This movie is an amazing production.
All the cast is perfect. Mind blowing.
This is the best Disney live action so far 
Who else cried ? Just WOW"
"Definitely a 10/10, Halle Berry played this role to the tee, her voice was absolutely breath taking. The graphics, colors, and animation was great. Definitely a must see movie"
I loved that it was very true to the original while still having its own amazing charm. Halle was absolutely beautiful and amazing. Her voice was mesmerizing.
The movie as a whole was good
"Totally loved it !!!!! Underwater scenes, mermaid tails, scene with Erin & Ariel in boat & song Kiss the Girl was awesome !!!!!"
"Halle Bailey is breathtaking. Her acting was incredible, her singing was incredible. I cried way too many times due to her phenomenal performance. Overall the movie was just unbelievably good."
Great movie! I took a group of 6 year olds and they loved it! Will definitely watch again.
"It was so good! Very entertaining, funny, and stuck to the original storyline. I also appreciated that there was no adult humor or ideological agenda cramming. Just good old fashioned, family friendly entertainment. Highly recommend."
"Loved the 3D, music and acting. Very beautiful and kept true to the story"
Cried 3 times. Brilliant film. Amazing beginning to the end . Cant wait to own it
"Love the Little Mermaid!! It was engaging, exciting, and entertaining. Haileys singing and acting was fantastic along with the other cast members. I loved Sebastian. He was very funny!"
I almost liked the ending a lot. very nice story and very funny I loved it
AMAZINNNNNNNNG. I loved it from beginning to end. I laughed & wanted to cry at times lol my inner child is fulfilled. The entire cast did a phenomenal job. Im happy !
We loved it. Very cute movie. It's a little different but still very good.
"It was absolutely beautiful.  Arielle was gorgeous. 
It is a must see movie."
Solid Disney classic!
"loved everything about it, entertained the entire way through"
"Enjoyed the movie very much.  The additional music was great and fit well with the original score.  The ""Under The Sea sequence was really beautiful."
Truly magical! Halle Bailey is amazing 😍😍
First time ever watching a movie 3D and it was awesome .
Halle did AMAZING!!!! I did tear up on part of your world and the ending. Just so surreal! Will definitely watch again.
Loved the movie and the new songs!!
"Maybe Im bring a little dramatic but I don’t remember the last time I saw the original but this movie was incredible. From the visuals to the acting to the vocals in the songs, I will definitely being seeing it about 2 more times. Halle KILLED it as Ariel and I will not stop singing part of your world. Melissa really showed she can be a villain as Ursula! I was nervous about her but she was amazing!"
Story concept and set design were awesome as well as the actors.
It was a fresh take on a classic!!! Halle Bailey was FANTASTIC!!!
"I thought they did a great job with all of the music and effects. Have to admit Im a little disappointed in how flounder looks, but the rest was really great. Highly recommend. It was close enough to be the same story, but the changes they made to the storyline work really well. My son and his friends loved it. We will probably see it again before its out of the theaters!"
Wonderful singing! A masterful live-action remake.
"Halle Bailey is phenomenal! The visuals were like eye candy, just beautiful."
The movie was very good.  It had suspense and of course a great ending. I loved the beautiful colors under the sea.
"It was absolutely amazing! I dont think they couldve made it any more like the Disney Classic, it was spot on! Loved it loved it! Also, Ariels speaking voice sounded just like Hilary Duff! Haha"
It was amazing from the graphics down to the vocals they did they Thang.
"It was fine. Totally competent film making. But ultimately pointless and, worse than that, significantly inferior to the original animated film. Its fascinating to me that Disney, arguably the greatest animation house in history, keeps making these live action remakes which remove all of the magic/ fun/ comedy of the original — as if Disney somehow doesnt understand the power of animation. For example, Under The Sea — animated, its fun and funny and delightful, all the other underwater creatures swimming around and playing instruments live action — its a stage wait, totally boring, who cares?

Also, why change the story? The additional songs and beats just made it longer. Thats it. No depth was added. 

And if you are going to write new songs, why Lin Manuel? Love him or hate him, his songs ALWAYS sound the same, and they NEVER sound like The Little Mermaid. The new scuttle song felt flown in from another movie. 

Melissa McCarthy is a fantastic and hilarious actress, but unfortunately in this movie she was directed to act like a New Yorker stereotype staple-gunned to a squid. 

Javier Bardem was fine, though strangely reserved. 

I liked Sebastian. He somehow still worked even in live action. But it was definitely weird that there was some unspoken rule that Sebastian, Flounder and Scuttle could all speak, but no other animals could. 

I missed the songs they took out. The Daughters of Triton and Les Poissons. Especially bc the replacements were Ill-fitting snooze fests. 

The addition of the Eric was adopted backstory added nothing. Feels like a screenwriter trying to justify his role after being hired to write a beloved movie that already exists. (Speaking of which, it took them a long time to finally give credit to the original writer-directors in the end credits.)

The original animated Little Mermaid is a truly great film with a fantastic and efficient script. Ultimately, deciding  to improve upon it without the benefit of being animated itself proved to be a bad idea. 

Having said all of that, my 12 year old daughter loved it. My 18 year old and 21 year old daughters did not. But Ill let them write their own reviews, should they want to."
Bad acting. Bad singing. Just bad.
Halle Bailey embodied Ariel from scene one! I loved this film!
They cut the crab in the kitchen scene with the chef .. that would have been funny ..
Loved how it stayed true to the original
"Everything was excellent. Story, effects, music all grew"
This movie was EVERYTHING! I loved the animated version but this version just took it to while new level!!!
We liked the idea that all the actors were great.  We didnt dislike anything
Perfect movie!! Absolutely BEAUTIFUL!!
"it was really really good. 
the only thing I wasn't crazy about was the beginning of the movie in 3d was extremely blury
 
it did change though throughout"
Loved the 3D choice. Movie was very entertaining
It was as good and action packed as any Marvel movie.  I couldn't leave my seat and cried at the end.  Very powerful messages and strong acting by all.   Perfectly casted.
"This is Disneys best live action film!!! The entire cast was awesome!!! The movie was so colorful and bright! Halle is perfect as Ariel, she is a true siren!!! I loved seeing ppl of all ages and races in a packed movie theater. Id definitely be down for a sequel."
she played her part well
"I loved this movie so much, Halle was a literal dream! Scuttle and Sebastian was very funny & under the sea was my favorite song."
A beautiful re-telling of a classic story! That cast was amazing and hats off to the producers for the beautiful display of diversity!
Blown away. Best live action Disney movie ever!
Amazing singer and beautiful artist. Well-made cgi in my opinion. Great plot. Forgot about some of the songs from the original Disney animation and was pleasantly reminded. They really brought it to life. I cried when she wanted to be part of that world on the rock with the water splashing. Great moment in the movie and will recommend it to anyone who isn’t afraid to express their emotions. Great acting and great music all around. I honestly don’t know why I didn’t give it a full 5 stars. Maybe because it still wasn’t better than a couple movies I’ve seen in the past year. I’ve seen a ton.
an amazing movie felt a little long but it was still amazing but the problem was the theater itself was super hot but that's not on the movie
"Loved the singing, cinematography was amazing, loved  everything!!!"
The Little Mermaid is everything we wanted! Our family had a blast and look forward to many watches in the future.
The Little Mermaid was simply breathtaking. The visuals were phenomenal and Halle Bailey's voice is quite literally ethereal. The main characters had such an incredible chemistry and they did an overall incredible job bringing this beautiful story to life. I love all of the changes/additions that they added into this live action version of The Little Mermaid. See it in Imax for an even more incredible experience!!
"Movie was brilliant. Halle Berry was excellent as Ariel. I'm not going to lie, she deserves to have credit. Black folks deserve to have more major roles"
Loved Halle and Jonah.  Perfect chemistry!!
I loved it all. All the actors are phenomenal. The graphics are great. Halle Bailey is a great Ariel.
"The storyline was good, and Melissa McCarthys interpretation of the character of Ursula was amazing! My kids loved every second and we might go back!"
Superduper movie I really enjoyed my granddaughter and I
Movie ok but too long. Also half hour of advertising is to long for a little kids movie as they cant sit that long.
Great!  Great animation mixed with live action!
It was such a gorgeous film! So much fun and Halle is absolutely perfect as Ariel. Melissa McCarthy is also phenomenal as Ursula. Eric’s song was decent but could’ve gone without it. Enjoyed it overall and highly recommend!
Probably the best live adaptation from Disney yet! The whole cast was phenomenal but Halle was the stand out. I’ve never heard her sing before but wow that girl can sing. Melissa was great as Ursula as well. It’s not a perfect movie with only small little nitpicks but overall a must watch
Much better than expected. Good blend of familiar and new! First class!
"I wasn't expecting much, hadn't heard great things, but only went because Ariel was my daughter's favorite when she was young and she just finished high school yesterday and this is how she wanted to celebrate with her dad. I really really loved this, though. Bardem and McCarthy helped it have some real heft. The look and feel was beautiful. I think I liked it more than the original animated movie and more than other Disney live-action remakes. See it on its own merits"
"Everything was perfect, I loved the whole movie"
I liked how it closely followed the animated version.  Loved the actors/characters.
"The acting was awful! Its unfortunate because this was one of my favorite Disney movies. Horrible graphics depicting water scenes, songs were nowhere near heartfelt or emotional by any means. Poorly done."
Good retelling. Would have liked to see a few more changes and the new songs were a little weak in my opinion. But string film!
story line stayed the same the movie was good definitely would say it's a must see.
Breath taking and great acting by all! It swept you in until the end!
"Doesn’t too the original, but one of the better Disney live action remakes.    Halle Bailey and Melissa McCarthy really shine in their roles."
Amazing movie! must see in theater. the reprises alone are worth the price of the ticket!
Too much singing. But I enjoyed the movie.
Great movie! Little to long
Go see it and form your own opinion. I loved it!
"WHAT A MOVIE!!!!! Its pure Disney Magic! Halle was the absolute standout of the whole film, but you have to give Melissas performance of Ursula a round of applause. This was my second viewing, and I cant wait to go back again! Part of your world (all three parts) had me in tears."
First Disney remake I’ve loved!!!! Scuttlebutt song was soooo cute
I loved it. It didn't tell it quite like the original but I love the new spin.
I liked that the movie was a bit animated for me and my kid it was exciting funny in some parts I overall loved the movie
"OUTSTANDING! The cast was amazing, music was awesome."
Loved the animation the colors and most importantly inclusion with the casting. Loved Halle!!
"The movie was stunning, Halle was amazing. She captured the true essence of The Little Mermaid. She did a wonderful job."
Not the worst Disney remake but not the best. It’s alright enjoyed it mostly
lived the new songs and the imagery! so much to look at 💕
"Visually stunning, music was originally put together and good. My daughter doesn't like the original but really enjoyed this one."
It was amazing! Will definitely see it again and tell everyone to go experience it as well!
"I absolutely loved it. It was everything I wanted it to be after being a little mermaid fanatic my whole life. 
King tritons outfit!!!! Scuttle was so good! Halle was amazing x a million. Missed the les poisons and the purple dress at the end because thats an iconic moment for me her walking out of the sea. but I was amazed by everything and dont forget Ursula so good so so good! Cant wait to see it again!!!"
My loved the singing and acting!
I enjoyed the little mermaid. I like that they stayed to the original script of the movie and they had a great diverse bunch of characters. I hated the family sitting in front of me with the kids that kept the lights on the entire time. It took away from the movie they were a distraction.
We loved it. It was magical!!!!
Amazing reenactment of the original film. All actors and actresses did an AMAZING job! Bravo!
"loved it. perfect in every way, just a little long for my 3.5 year old. She loved all the music and the action."
Loved it. So fun. Hailey’s voice was beautiful and her interpretation of Ariel was perfect. Loved Melissa McCarthy’s Ursella
Ursula is definitely the star of the show!!!
Took my 5 year old granddaughter snd we both loved it!
Gorgeous movie absolutely amazing. Halle Bailey delivers a fantastic performance as Ariel and Melissa McCarthy was a perfect choice for Ursula.
Great movie!!! We loved it.
"Loved it, so nostalgic. Halle as Ariel is splendid and Melissa totally embodies Ursula. Love the diversity of the cast, the updates story line and new songs by LMM will see avian"
Love this movie! Ariel is my favorite princess since I was little and I was scared they would change too much but jt was really good! All the changes tied into together perfectly! So good!
A great visual spectacle with wonderful performances. Just a tad long.
"The music, colors, and the crab was hilarious"
It was soooooooo goood!!!
"This movie was fantastic. I was worried about the CGI based on some reviews but Disney did a great job (we all know this is fiction so the CGI comments are silly). The lead actress was adorable and all the actors were fun, including Ursula. It really pulled at the heart strings in the end. Go see it!"
Great movie although nuff singing
"Amazingly beautiful with an awesome cast! The visuals are breathtaking, and the music/vocals are 5 stellar stars 🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟!!!"
Great movie! I would watch it again.
Drags in parts and dialogue is cringe-worthy
It captured everything like the animated version. Ursala was wicked as ever lol.
"A wondrous delight. Halle is perfection & the sequences of “Part of Your World” & “Kiss the Girl” are, too. Halle & Jonah ooze chemistry. Melissa appropriately hams it up."
"Perfection is detailed always with Disney! Magical as expected. We’ll cast and visually stunning film. My only. Note.. is the music  seemed bless potent in feeling it. But overall , a must see .."
Visually stunning with minor added explanatory story/character changes that work only to enhance this movie. I love this retelling! The cast diversity is definitely an enhancement!
"Casting was perfect for this live action The Little Mermaid. Halle Bailey did a great job as Ariel, reminding us she is after all a teenager with dreams of her own. Couldn't get a better Ursula than Melissa McCarthy! Potentially frightening scenes for very young children with Ursula and her skull treasures, electric eel friends and anger scenes at the end. Prince Eric a young man who any girl would want seems a bit old for Ariel, his added song was ok, great voice. Multi cultural, multi nationality cast. The colors under the sea beyond real."
"The movie was great. My granddaughters loved it. They loved ursela, Ariel and scuttle so much!!"
Fantastic! A wonderful treat for the whole family.
"Love love loved the movie!! I didn't like the moving seats, water sprays and air bursts as much as my 9 year old but we haven't been to this theater in many years. You get extras with a 3D movie now I suppose. Overall the movie was absolutely amazing. And we both cried."
The beautiful woman who played Ariel - did so perfectly I cant imagine a better person! Absolute magical watching in the theatre. They made sure to add in all the beautiful most iconic parts of the original and nailed it!!! Exceeded my expectations for the movie!
"Five star not because of the visuals or the vfx, but for the cast, and truly this movie is the definition of camp lolololollllll"
"It was basically a musical, but i shouldve expected that when I saw it was produced by Lin Manuel Miranda. There wasnt much dialogue between the characters and in almost every scene they were singing, even the prince. Which is weird because he doesnt sing in the animated version. Most scenes were changed or completely left out, especially the ending. The setting of the movie looked like it was on a Caribbean island. In the end they made it seem like their marriage was going to be the change of the future. When there was actual dialogue between the characters it was enjoyable. Halle sang beautifully but they made her drag out every syllable while she was singing which was kinda annoying. But the cast did a great job acting :)"
Terrible. Poorly casted. Felt like a bad tribute to the original.
"The Little Mermaid (2023) is a magical, breathtakingly, gorgeous ride of a summer blockbuster. This faithful reimagining of the original story and 1989 classic boasts a powerhouse performance from Halle Bailey who's stands toe to toe with Jodi Benson's iconic version of the little mermaid. Melissa McCarthy is deliciously evil as the Sea Witch Ursula, with Jonah Hauer-King and Javier Bardem giving some of their best work as Prince Eric and King Triton respectively. Not to mention the ecstatic vocal talents of Daveed Diggs as Sebastian, Awkafina as Scuttle, and Jacob Tremblay as Flounder. Director Rob Marshall along with Screenwriter David Magee has crafted a little mermaid that honors and respects the original film, but breathes a new life and energy into this version of the classic story. Go out and see it on the biggest screen possible. Disney's The Little Mermaid is sure to be another gem from that will be beloved for years."
The most beautiful live action movie ever
What a beautiful story and the actors were fantastic! I’m going to see it again
The only good thing in this movie was Melissa McCarthy.
Love it. Beautiful movie.
I loved the black princess 👑
Halle Bailey was the perfect Ariel— sweet and charming with a voice to die for. Loved the new songs. This felt like a richer experience than the original which I also love. Went into this expecting to not like it and was surprisingly blown away.
It was very good I would see it again
absolutely loved this movie and so did my daughter. Halle did amazing!!!!
Just how I remembered it
Spectacular. The whole audience applauded after her song. She was amazing.
"Can't say enough about how much I liked and was surprised about this movie! There's been so much hype over races and woke issues with Disney lately that I honestly prepared myself for the worst. Yes, multiple races are represented however they blend into the story and don't even get near to being over the top on any level! Each actor plays their part well and remains true to the storyline. Woke-ism aside the movie is a spectacular trip into the world of both Hans Christian Andersen and also draws from Disney's former Little Mermaid movie in many ways. The photography is stunning and the quality is exactly what an audience would come to expect from a Disney production. The only warning I would suggest is that there are some pretty scary scenes surrounding the wonderful Ursula character done to perfection by Melissa McCarthy that the little ones might become frightened by so maybe think about not bringing kids under 5 years old or so. All in all a wonderful couple of hours in another world which left me with a much better feeling about Disney. They do still seem to realize that telling a story is a way of escape and that's in essence what movies should be mostly all about!"
Wonderful adaptation of the original! Fresh and fun. Excited to see it again because Halle is such a lovely little mermaid.
It was the best Disney remake. It brought my childhood back to life. I was singing and dancing in my seat. Ill be back to see it in 3D.
"Best remake from Disney yet!!!! All the colors, new songs, more storyline. I was amazed at how well they were able to make my favorite movie even better."
"The cinematography, the voice of Halley, the actors—awesome!  It was wonderful watching these little black girls coming out of the theater with their families—singing Aerials song with perfect pitch, wish I could be part of your world!-because they could see themselves projected in a Disney movie, which allows them to relate to the movie so well!  Grown men came out tearing up!  One of them said to me:  Thats one of the best movies I have ever seen.— as we both walked out of the theater.  This is a must see!  Take your kids!  Thank you, Disney!"
I would see this movie over and over again. They did such an amazing job at filling in the missing pieces while also keeping it similar to the original. The cast was amazing & I love how realistic it seems.
"Everything, the animation, new songs a fantastic phenomenal movie."
Halle glows in this vibrant remake that is pretty faithful to the original.
The original cartoon was so much better... the singing and the characters were not giving me little mermaid vibes it just wasn't good to me
"Perfect mesh of Pixar and Planet Earth, verbiage to describe ocean destruction- not over lavish or excessive princess detail, which would be fitting to see in a princess movie, but well done."
I loved the slight changes and the new songs. The imagery was beautiful.
"Do not see this movie if you loved the original.  Added/deleted scenes, changed original songs, mediocre acting, dull colors, changed storyline, and WAY too long.  

Will not watch it again."
It was a visual feast with glorious singing!
"As a whole, the movie was good. However, the music was terrible. Unnecessary songs added, lyrics changed to original songs. I'm sad because I love Lin Manuel Miranda. Hamilton still gets played daily in my home. But this soundtrack was not great. Adding Ariel to throw in an ""Under the Sea"" here and there during the song was misplaced. ""Kiss The Girl"" is my all-time favorite Disney song, and this version failed- it sounded like a watered down Kidz Bop version. Didn't give you the buildup that the original song did.

The parts that were understandably supposed to be darker were too dark. It was difficult to see some of those scenes.

Melissa McCarthy was outstanding. Daveed Diggs had us laughing every time Sebastian was onscreen. Awkwafina was just bad. We cringed with all of Scuttle's lines. And I normally like her, but in this movie it was just off.

It's Disney and it's The Little Mermaid so I'll still but a hard copy when it's available for our collection. But we were left semi-underwhelmed."
"A must see, perfection!!"
Surprisingly beautiful movie! The updates were subtle and still somehow kept the overall feeling of the movie. Really enjoyed it and want to see it again before its out of theaters.
"We thought the movie was absolutely great. I loved the 3D effects and the glasses made it perfect. My granddaughters loved it as well, who are 5 & 12. Halle did an amazing job."
Halle IS The little mermaid!!! Her voice was everything in this film. It was wonderful to watch!
"Halle was so amazing perfect for this role, love love love!!!"
"Im a 90s kid and the cartoon was my first true obsession and halle was simply magical - ariels voice and spirit are vital to her character and she was enchanting - every acting and creative choice (esp the ones I questioned from
The trailer) that was made was incredibly executed and not a single new element  took away from the elements of the cartoon that were being recreated! the music was lovely and the characters were so likable"
"A few bad CGI parts not a fan of the way they did Prince Eric. Also, not a fan of one of the songs"
It was a beautiful movie and really did justice to the original Disney film.
The film was very beautiful! Halle’s voice is magnificent and her acting was stellar! I’m glad I watched this film because I really enjoyed it.
My niece was dancing in her seat and I couldn’t help but laugh out loud and dance a little myself. We had a great time.
Historical and mythological context was added to this version.  Even facts about how sea creatures adapt to the environment were added. I loved seeing Jody Benson in the movie again.
Everything from the writing to the Music to the visual effects was amazing ! Best Disney Real life remake thus far !!! Can't wait to see it again in 3D!
"From the dramatic opening of the ocean, beautiful to watch, actors chosen for this are perfect. The music, the undersea world beautiful, storyline kept me captivated. Had a lovely message of acceptance. This movie was created with love"
It is very long and not attention grabbing however in todays world it has a happier ending than we get on any news program.
"Great movie! CGI wasn't the greatest, but it wasn't bad either. A great family friendly movie! Take your kids they will love it!"
Halle Bailey's performance was the highlight of the movement. You feel all the emotions watching this. highly recommend
Excellent adaptation of the original movie. Lots of new fun songs and the visuals were just amazing! Everyone in the cast was perfect for their role!
"It was magical, transcendent. Made me feel like a kid again :)"
"Halle it’s Ariel, the music it’s fantastic! Disney magic on his peack"
I loved the New Little Mermaid. The songs were incredible. Graphics were out of this world.
I highly recommend any fan of the original going to see it. Theres just enough change to the story to make you think. Seeing again on tuesday
I felt like I was in an aquarium
"Loved the graphics. Loved Melissa McCarthy as Ursula. The prince was not a great singer, but overall, it was a great show."
A Must See! I highly recommend this film to everyone to go see! The cast was absolutely wonderful!  Halle Bailey did an Outstanding Performance Melissa McCarthy was dynamic. A beautifully done movie with OSCAR written all over it!! I took my Girl Scout Troop to see the movie and we LOVED it!!!
I loved everything about it!!! It was great!!! I’ve always love The Little Mermaid and it met my standards!!!
True to the Cartoon with minor tweaks that made sense.  I enjoyed the clearness of the ocean. Halle embodied the innocence of the original cartoon Ariel.  She was magical to watch and I can definitely see why she won the part.  Everytime she sang it was truly a Siren Song!  Definitely a must see
Save your money and watch it on standard screen. 3D was a real let down. Ursula was a bit scary for young kids. But overall was kind of entertainment
The casting was wonderful.  The story was great.
"I was very skeptical at first when it came to watching this film. I must say, I do not regret watching it at all!.... All throughout I felt the magic of Disney. Being a fan of the original classic allowed me to look and appreciate the hard work put into this films and some amazing side character performances that stood out along side the main stars. Though it wasn't perfect, it was still amazing. This movie is easily a 9 out of 10 for me."
the film is beautiful and i MOSTLY had a great time watching it. Bailey and Mcarthy are the stand outs.
Loved this movie so much! Halle makes the perfect Ariel and Melissa McCartney was the best Ursula
"The witch and the crab was fantabulous!! The special effects were all beautiful! Loved the King! The chemistry between Ariel and the prince was very touching and I shedded a tear on a couple of scenes. Enjoyed all the castle and island fights people. The diversity of the whole cast was refreshing, even the scenery was great."
Refreshing film. Loved the diversity. Simply AMAZING!
I loved this movie. The representation from ALL cultures it was so raw so authentic the entire cast was just amazing
It was a good replica of the original. I liked a couple of the new songs they sang. Some of the singing you could tell was lip sang because it was off.
"This story recharged Disney and I loved this reboot in live action!  All of the actors and actresses did their job splendidly and what could be better than more music by Lin Manuel?  I have heard critics pan this as a dud, and I say poo on them!  Take your loved ones and enjoy!"
Loved this movie.  The underwater colors were so beautiful
Beautiful movie from start to finish didnt want it to end
"What a fun movie!! So glad I got to see this at my big age, hahah.  Halle was GREAT! Sebastian was HILARIOUS! Go see this movie."
Best Disney live action I have ever seen! Halle Bailey embodies Ariel in every single way! Cant wait to go back and see this movie again.
Cute movie! Forgot it was a musical tho lol
I like the overarching message stated at the end of the movie. Resonates loudly in this current day.
I loved it! Great family movie!
loved the movie! Halle was amazing 9
"We laughed, we cried, we got all the feels. What a fanatic movie.  They did the original proud and this is coming from a die hard little mermaid fan"
Halle Bailey was born for this role. She was amazing from the acting to the singing. The cgi was great & colorful. Overall very entertaining & well put together film. Made us Disney fans proud.
"Me encanto, me gusto que mantuvieron la historia original, me gusto el efecto 4D, mis hijos y yo nos divertimos mucho, el efecto de estar nadando y ver esa maravilla de colores en el mar me encanto."
Started off a little slow but I LOVED it! It was very nostalgic but new at the same time. Definitely recommend 100%
best disney live action film by FAR point blank period.
"love it 
wish I can see it in Spanish here in CA"
"Beautiful ocean cinematography, BIG URSULA, and Halle Bailey as Ariel all made for a fun and enjoyable watch."
First time seeing Little Mermaid at age 54. Good movie.
"I might be biased bc little mermaid was my favorite as a kid, but I think this is by far the best live action Disney has done!"
I loved it it was a wonderful experience. Dont care what anybody says.
Halle Bailey!!!!!!!!!!!!!! She is Ariel. Melissa McCarthy shocked me. Really good! This is a new favorite and my favorite live action remake so far.
the visuals were beautiful and halle bailey delivered
LOVED IT!! Every single second of this money was amazing! It was worth the wait! Halle Bailey was just an amazing Ariel!.
"Good , liked that they put a twist on it ."
Halle Bailey is a super star!
"Such an amazing movie , cannot seem to stop admiring"
"It’s a good movie, long but pretty and adventurous .  If you are rating it zero/one because of the casting…. Grow up."
An amazing and magical experience! True to the classic with all of the 30years of mastering special effects. 7+would enjoy! Ursala is pretty intense and as an adult I loved every minute of it.
"I absolutely love the movie. I laughed and cried, and of course, singing along."
A beautiful remake of the animated classic of the same name. Halle Bailey is incredible as Ariel and Mellisa McCarthy is terrifying as the sea witch Ursula. Every Disney fan will leave the theatre singing “under the sea!
Loved it so much. So nostalgic but the re-imagination of a classic was iconic
halles voice is amazing! Sebastians accent was AWFUL and king tritons acting was very wooden and underwhelming...overall i considered this movie more like an adaptation of the original ( like the live action Aladdin) than a remake (like B&B).
"I thought it was fantastic from the beautiful colors and textures of the era-accurate costumes to Halle Baileys stunning voice. The writing was strong and though some changes were made to story, I felt that they actually fixed some plot holes that the og film had. Halles portrayal of Ariel was absolutely astounding and I found the colors and aesthetic of the world building to be just lovely."
A MUST SEE MOVIE! Halle Bailey was phenomenal and is a superstar in the making! She was perfectly cast as Ariel and the rest of the cast was Amazing as well. I’m buying my second ticket as we speak!
SUCH A CUTE MOVIE! Omg totally worth the wait for it.
"My girl was phenomenal, PERIODT!!!!"
Loved everything! Amazing in every aspect!
"such a great film , a work of art,  everyone was cast perfectly, especially Halle, she was born for this role, she brought her magic to Ariel, with her godly voice especially, you can just see that she gave her all into her strong yet effortless performance, it looked beautiful, every character had chemistry with each other, especially Jonah who gave a strong & handsome performance, Melissa was also great with her strong & fierce portrayal, the movie was funny, mostly because of our three animal friends who were brought to life by amazing talent, its romantic & a feast for the eyes, the music was obviously great with the barely noticeable but appreciated updates, the new music was great as well, just an iconic gorgeous film"
Absolutely loved it. 10/10. Beautiful movie and soooo captivating.
"They did flounder dirty!! I didn’t like it I had high hopes for this movie, as it’s my favorite movie growing up…"
PHENOMENAL!!! Halle Bailey is the PERFECT Ariel!! She shines the entire time and that VOICE!!! Absolutely beautiful!
"I’m not a Disney guy but took my girl to watch this movie. She loved it and it’s kind of a reminder of her childhood. So since she loved it give it 5 stars. The characters were funny, plot was good, no complaints oh and animations were great"
Literally so amazing!!! I love that we have two little mermaid movies always been an absolute fan. The little mermaid has always been my favorite movie this live action is everything I couldve wanted!! My niece 6 loved!   She said she cried at the end I absolutely cried more than once!! Laughed the entire time. I will definitely be going again!!!
Awesome ti see Ariel and her story come to life! I enjoyed the new scenes and seeing more of a connection between her & Eric!
everything was perfect. no one could’ve brought ariel to life but halle
I loved the movie!! The movie looked 3D just magical I took my 2 year old who has never been to the movies and she loved it!!
"I love the storyline, the optics were beautiful, Ariel is Really pretty BUT my only recommendation is to Not see it in 3D.. I feel that the 3D feature takes away from the movie instead of enhancing it"
"Phenomenal I laughed I cried , I bawled"
"Stunning visuals, amazing performances, kept beloved parts and additions only enhanced the movie. Will be seeing several more times"
Such a great remake of a classic! The original songs were amazing! Ursula was ICONIC!
Phenomenal casting and awesome nostalgia and yet fresh take on a classic!
Ariel was brought to life
"It was funny, emotional, scary, and different in its own way! My daughter and I enjoyed it and loved all the colors and songs."
It was such a great moving to watch. Halle Baileys voice was just so beautiful to listen to and she portrayed Ariel very elegantly . I mean the entire cast was filled with amazing vocals and talent!! I recommend this film to anyone who isnt stuck on comparing the original animation to the live action!!
An incredible retelling of the classic story
THIS WAS ABSOLUTELY THE BEST LIVE ACTIOK DISNEY HAS DONE!!!!!!
"10/10. Loved everything about this movie. The diversity of the casting, the graphics, the humor, the precise character portrayal. It is a must see movie!"
"I just saw the Little Mermaid (2023), and I loved it!!! Rob Marshall and his team understood the assignment when it comes to making a Disney live action remake of a classic. You need to honor the original, but find ways to do things different and maybe fix any plot holes.

Pros:

Halle Bailey knocked out of the park as Ariel. To all of the naysayers that were pissed off that she was cast, SHUT UP!!!! For a role like this, it shouldn’t matter what race Ariel is. She had the look, the voice, and the acting to pull off this role. She sings “Part of Your World” very beautifully, as well as a new song. The fact that Jodi Benson passed the torch to Halle in movie and out of movie is truly high praise.

Javier Bardem was great as King Triton.

Melissa McCarthy won me over as Ursula. I was really worried that she wouldn’t be the right fit for Ursula, but she proved me wrong. The one thing I needed from her was for her to sing “Poor Unfortunate Souls,” and she did it and she sang it the right way. Thank you so much for that, Melissa!!!

Jonah Hauer-King was good as Prince Eric. He gets a better story arc and character motivation. He even gets a new song, “Uncharted Waters.”

Awkwafina was perfect as Scuttle. Every role she touches is gold. Now she just needs to have a role in Star Wars and she can complete the trifecta.

Daveed Diggs was good as Sebastian.

Jacob Tremblay was good as Flounder.

The directing was great. It was shot on location and shot well. The underwater scenes were beautiful.

All of the songs were done justice, and sung the right way. I even liked the new songs. Having Alan Menken back and Lin-Manuel Miranda is a just amazing. Disney is winning when these two are doing the music for their movies.

They fixed some plot holes and story beats to fit this version, and it works.

Cons:

It does feel like a drags a little throughout the movie. 

I wish we got more of Ariel’s sisters, but I get it’s not their story.

Overall, this remake is worth a watch. It will definitely be making the top tier list of the better Disney live action remakes with Beauty and the Beast (2017), Aladdin (2019), Maleficent, Cinderella (2015), and Cruella.

10/10 highly recommend"
IT WAS ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL!!! I can’t wait to see it again and again
It was amazing ! Cast was awesome love the extras they added in if people didn’t enjoy it they are closed minded and wouldn’t have liked it no matter what because it was a 10/10
Halle Bailey!!!!! if you for one second had any doubt about her.... you will be proven wrong. she was AMAZING!!!!!! As was Melissa McCarthy and the rest of the cast.
"kept true to the original Disney movie with a few added songs, some of which were very hard to sit through. The CGI could have been better and a few complaints but overall not bad. not great but not bad either."
This movie felt and looked dull. But the songs (originals) were great. The new songs weren’t necessary. 15 mins too long. Ariel was 10/10.
One of the best Disney remakes thus far.
Love love love 12/10
"no seafoam dress :(, and ariel’s sisters only had 30 seconds of screen time , over all very beautiful movie i would still recommend to watch"
Amazing!!!! They added more depth to Ariel and Eric’s characters. Halle Bailey was the perfect casting choice!
Amazing adaptation to live screen! We felt like we were watching a Broadway musical in the best way. The characters were all amazing and they stayed true to all the parts of the original that we know and love  we were singing along to every word and smiling ear to ear.
Love how they stuck to the storyline and Halle was AMAZING!!!
During the movie at one of the parts when Ariel is singing the sound cut off for a little while then pop back on hey say on Weseloh then the sound got very high at the movie theaters.
"I loved that they stick to the original along with some added extra surprises,"
"The color appeared washed out leaving a dark visual,  The environmental comment seemed out of place."
"I loved this move so much, the changes that they made to the movie made it fit the TODAYS woman. It fun, it was sad, the emotion of this movie was EVERYTHING!"
everything this about this movie was amazing
Absolutely beautiful film. Great music great effects! True in a lot of ways to the original! Great remake
such a wonderful movie! the cast were PERFECT picks!
LOVED this movie! SO beautiful & well done.
Phenomenal but I could have done without the singing from Eric
HALLE BAILEY IS A STAR!!!!
"Reading a lot of reviews saying that nothing new is added, but I don’t think that’s true. I love that Prince Eric gets more depth and back story. The Caribbean vibe of the town is wonderful. Ariel’s sisters cleaning up the coral reef after yet another shipwreck. And that shipwreck scene was done so well! The acting and singing is amazing. Even Vanessa’s short time on screen stands out. The Little Mermaid stays true to the original with a few updates that just make sense (Eric and Ariel really are a true match “written in the stars”). Love it. I want to see it again in imax to really appreciate the vibrant scenes (yea it was a little dark in parts, but also the depths of the ocean are pretty dark, especially at night so…). All in all this is a film my daughters and I will definitely watch again and again. They said Sebastian and Scuttle were very funny!"
Everything Well done enjoyed it very much
Beautifully done !!!! Bravo 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾🧜🏾‍♀️🧜🏾‍♀️🧜🏾‍♀️
"Incredible retelling. Its beautiful, stunning, and a musical delight. Halle Bailey is a perfect Ariel, Melissa is Marvelously malicious, and Jonah is swoon worthy. Everyone shines in the best Disney live action remake to date. Everything i loved about the original mixed with cute new things. I cried. Go see this movie!!!"
"Truly a beautiful and emotionally moving film that gives you such a sense of nostalgia with so much story and depth with this new movie. You can sit and listen to Halle sing all day, Jonah also! They were both beautiful as Ariel & Eric with great chemistry. Ursula, Triton, & even Sebastian were all captivating! The entire cast was perfect! 🩵🧜🏽‍♀️"
It was rather fun! makes me wanna make a trip to the Bohamas! Can't wait for Lilo and Stitch next
Very Surprised! Bailey is perfection
Perfect couldnt have asked flr better
"The movie was FABULOUS!! The music, the actors, the colors... AMAZING!! And I still cried at the end."
Absolute beautiful film! 10 out of 10
A lovely representation of many talented people of all shades and shapes blended together. The vocals were perfect! I enjoyed this movie much more than I thought I would. Very nice!
Amazing. i’m really speechless
"This is one of the better live-action Disney films, which had the original songs and a couple new ones that didn't suck. You can tell having Lyn co-produce helped the whole ensemble come together magically."
I loved it.  The storyline is a little more in depth from its original and has a great plot and definition to meanings. Seeing it in 3D was awesome!
just incredible!  It honored the original film and filled in gaps.  I really fun experience.  Beautiful art and colors.  True art.  Well done!!
Brilliant adaptation of a classic
It was AMAZING. Halle had me in awe the whole time
"No, It’s not the best live action Disney movie (Aladdin/Jungle Book), but that isn’t a total bummer. Halle is incredible and her voice alone will send chills down your fins. Supporting characters were wonderful and funny as the movie went by. The movie follows the formula of the original while adding some songs and story twists but to the core it’s the Little Mermaid you know and Love. The visuals and Prince Eric’s solo new song was painful. And it just doesn’t sweep you off your feet with it’s emotional ending, but the family enjoyed it as did the theater, who irrupted in applause."
"The volume was really low the first half of the movie, had to tell a worker twice if they can put the volume up!"
"I loved this movie but even before she lost her voice, ariels lines seemed limited. The magical aspect of the movie felt absent. However, the actress for ursela tryly brought the movie to life, she did an amazing job! most of songs did feel a little awkward but great nonetheless"
It was 10/10. Loved every bit of it.
INCREDIBLE ! They did such an amazing job . Each character was cast so perfectly . My kids and i loved it so much !
Loved it. Really lived out my inner child !
"8/10. Aside from Ariel’s performance and songs. It was okay. The new songs in the movie, we’re actually great too!"
"My two daughters my daughter in law , my grandson and granddaughter enjoyed Lil Mermaid Halle did an Awesome Job playing the role as Airreal. I give it a thumbs up!!👍🏽❤️"
"So good! The story really doesnt stray too far from the original. Theres only one song missing that the original had that is not in this movie and it wasnt a big deal. It was great, would definitely watch again."
Bravo Disney! Halle was amazing!! Loved it!!!
"I liked the way they stuck to the original script with some little extra touches here and there and the new songs that werent in the original too! It was an instant classic for us! We will be buying it without a doubt! 
Halle Bailey is Ariel!!!!!!"
The graphics were AMAZING!! This was so so good!!
Halle was a PERFECT Ariel!  Her voice is stunning and her acting fits the role of a Disney princess wonderfully
Phenomenal! Halle IS the Little Mermaid! Melissa was AMAZING as Ursula! Can’t wait to see it again!
I actually enjoyed this reimagining more than I thought I would.
Loved Halles performance!
Second time seeing and will be going a third time. This movie is tooooo good
"Excellent !! Cast, colors, special effects. DEFINITELY A MUST SEE!!!!!  LOVED IT"
Enjoyed the cinematography and the creative choices made. Enjoyed the 3+ new songs that were included in the film.
JUST BREATH TAKING AND MAGICAL😭😭😭
Must see for any Little Mermaid fan. Loved it!!!
Best movie ever I cried so much! Will be re watching
"WOOW. soundtrack is amazing dont want to spoil it but wether youve watched the animated or not . You have to watch this, especially if you can appreciate the little mermaid and disney movies in general."
Great film!!! Halle did such and amazingly beautiful job!! The whole cast matter of fact! Great great production
"THE MOVIE WAS AMAZING!! THE GRAPHICS, THE TALENT, HALLE IS A STAR!!!!! THIS MOVIE IS A MUST SEE !!!"
BEST MOVIE OF 2023! I love how they developed the story from the original movie and the chemistry between Ariel and Eric was elite! 😍😍😍 The Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea in theaters next year 🤞
"When I was a little girl I was ENAMORED with The Little Mermaid. She was the best singer, and that naturally drew me to her in addition to her adventurous spirit. My room was covered in Ariel from sheets, decals, comforter, poster and of course the Ariel sized pillow. This new adaptation does MORE than pay homage to the first. It is spectacular in every way. Ive never gone out of my way to rate a movie but I had to for this one. I have a few minor passing things but overall I loved it. Halle SHINES as Ariel Im every way. I loved almost all of the the new song adaptations (except one)  and thoroughly enjoyed the sounds of the Caribbean throughout. My childhood self is beaming ear to ear. I definitely choked back my tears at the end. And it brings me a little extra joy to know Ariel now looks like me."
Absolutely loved this movie. The original was my favorite movie growing up and this brought back many great memories. Halle is amazing and her voice is the BEST.
"It’s received a lot of criticism even before it came out, but as someone who loved the original Disney little mermaid, this one also stayed very true to the storyline, very few add ins, but overall great movie!"
Lovely for a second time around
Halle did an amazing job!! I cried 5 minutes in and several times throughout. So beautiful and the visuals were astounding. Melissa McCarthy did great as Ursula too!
Beautiful movie. Just absolutely beautiful!
"Excellent movie, did a great job following the original. Singing was amazing."
Beat my expectations by a million percent!
This movie was amazing!
I loved the live-action version of Disney’s The Little Mermaid! I remember watching the movie as a little girl and felt just as captivated by this version as I did back then. The ending made me tear up. Halle’s voice is phenomenal and Melissa McCarthy did her thing! The casting was spot on!
It seems Hallee Bailey was born for this role. Very charming film & the visuals were stunning! I thought the cast was good too!
"Such a fun, and true to story, adaption of The Little Mermaid that we all know and love!"
"The little mermaid was amazing from beginning to end a true love story , and a family must see"
"Halle Bailey and Melissa McCarthy brought it in this gorgeous adaptation. And speaking of gorgeous… Jonah Hauer-King😍. Special nod to Noma Dumezweni, in a small role here, but brings excellence to the screen as always!"
They did amazing. New music was perfectly written and performed.
It was such an amazing live action remake and I don’t say that lightly. The cinematography was great and the CGI was fun. Great musical numbers! My son even said he liked it better than the Mario Movie!!!
"I absolutely LOVED this movie. Halle Bailey was incredible as Ariel. She drew me in every time she was on screen. Melissa McCarthy also surprised me with her performance as Ursula. Overall, it's clear the people making this movie truly understood what makes these classic Disney stories feel magical, and they were able to bring that magic to life (imo) better than any other live action Disney remake has done. Oh, and see it in 3D if you can!"
"Solid movie. It was not as dark as everyone tried to make it out to be. Underwater scenes were well lit and colorful except for Ursulas cave which was dark with fluorescent colors. The new songs felt ver broadway/musical theater compared traditional Disney songs. Best change was adding to the Eric character. He was fleshed out more and, I felt, did a lot of heavy lifting with Halle. Daveed added to the levity. Would watch it again."
It was a story retold with more in-depth characters development. Definitely bridged gaps in the original and it seemed to have more life.
Finally! A live action remake done right! I loved it!
"Absolutely wonderful, my granddaughters enjoyed it as much as their Nana. Loved it!"
"The Little Mermaid had a lot to live up to considering it’s predecessor is a classic and beloved Disney movie that single handed saved the Disney co. From bankruptcy and started a “renaissance” of Broadway styled musical movies spawning Aladdin and Beauty and the Beast just to name a few. In my opinion, it is safe to say that The Little Mermaid (2023) Does not disappoint, at least on most levels. The visuals are beautiful in many areas particularly “Under The Sea” bringing to life a wide array of colorful sea life to screen, some you may recognize and some maybe not, but they are wonderful to see nonetheless. Halle Bailey is a near perfect Ariel  she captures the innocence and yearning of the character and has a powerhouse voice to boot. She’s incredibly charming in the role and she will have a lustrous career after this for sure. Another standout is Melissa McCarthy as Ursula the sea witch. I was one to discredit McCarthy in the beginning  I thought she would reduce the role to a SNL spoof of Ursula but boy I was wrong. She brought out her inner diva and it’s great to watch. Some things could’ve been left out (a new song called The Scuttlebut comes to mind) and other things should’ve been left in (Chef Louis and the song Les Poisson were totally MIA) but the most part the additions/subtractions didn’t hurt the movie. It wasn’t perfect but it was certainly alot better than other live action adaptations I’ve seen so far. 4/5 stars Go see it if not only for seeing Halle Bailey become a STAR."
"Just got out of seeing this movie. It was pretty great!! I must say, the trailers and tv spots don't do the visuals any justice. Watched it in IMAX and it was absolutely stunning!! The actors are all great, especially the lead characters. The chemistry between the lead characters (Halle & Jonah) is insane! Off the charts! The story is the same as the original but more expanded upon in a good way. And Halle's voice....THAT VOICE! Overall, pretty solid movie. The time just passes by and you don't feel the runtime. Definitely recommend it, especially for families. Gonna see it again, hopefully not seated with kids behind me again, because the kids  behind me kept laughing, singing along and talking so much. Which I suppose is fun, but a bit distracting lol"
True enough to the original with a modern twist
"It was a fun and refreshing spruce up of the original Little Mermaid story line. All the iconic scenes were present along with newly well appointed ones. Like the rap by Scuttle, Scuttlebutt. I also enjoyed the slight remixes in the original songs, most notably in Under the Sea."
Best live action Ive ever seen!! Very true to the original with a few twists! Absolutely love and will rewatch again and again for years to come
"Amazing movie, great graphics, music was so beautiful! Highly recommend"
One of the best live remakes Disney has put out. Sebastian steals the show but the dynamics between Ariel and Eric is great! King triton was definitely the weakest part of the whole film.
"Halle is absolutely Ariel! I never cried in cinemas but this movie just made me right when she sang Part Of Your World. Everyone did a fantastic job, Melissa Mccarthy omg!!!  Cant wait to rewatch it over and over again!"
"Wow! It was literally amazing! The whole theater laughed and applauded together. What a time. As much as I loved the first one, this one was so great also! The acting through and through was great - Halle did amazing! My daughter wants to see it again and so do I so we will!"
AMAZING HALLE IS ARIEL
Excellent remake of a classic tale. CGI was unbelievably real and the revised music was perfect for this updated version. I will see it again and maybe even a third time. May be a bit dark (scary) for little ones under 5 but that speaks to the creators and actors. LOVED IT and so did my 37 year old daughter and her daughter.
Great movie loved that it flowed so well with the original movie
Not sure this need a live action movie.
Halle Bailey is phenomenal. Shes a star in the making!
"It was a little too long but the movie was very well done. The acting, scenery & special effects were on point!"
The Little Mermaid 2023 is so sweet and very endearing just like the first one. The mix of live action and cartoon was done so expertly. I sang along with all the familiar songs as well as the rest of the theater. Just missed the scene with the chef and Sebastian trying to escape the buffet table. Some scenes might be scary for really young ones. They made Ursula pretty dark and ominous.
Enjoyed this so much. Halle’s voice is so beautiful!
It was magical my baby girl loved it
"Wonderful! Visually great, beautiful performances by the actors.   I would recommend to all"
"Awesome Movie,even cried at the end!!!!!Very Enjoyable movie!!!!"
"I loved it! Its super cute, the visuals are great. The added songs will sing to your soul and give you goosebumps. A must-see for the whole family."
Loved it! Great adaptation that still closely followed the original movie. Definitely felt like the 2 hours flew by and was left wanting more. I will absolutely go see this again while it’s in theaters!
"This is easily Disney’s best live action film, Halle Bailey’s siren song puts you under a trance and you feel apart of her world. McCarthy’s Ursula was brilliant, and perfectly camp. I can see myself re-watching this film as many times as I did the original when I was a kid. Definitely recommend this, you don’t want to miss out on this film, Disney still brings the magic it did 34 years ago✨"
Loved my girl halle she did amazing!!
"HALLE BAILEY WAS AMAZING! The voice, the songs, the story! i can't wait to watch it again!!!"
DISNEY DID NOT DISAPPOINT US!!! IT WAS AMAZING!!
"LOVED IT, as well as my five year old! Halle Bailey played an AMAZING Ariel as did Melissa McCarthy with Ursula! The music was everything just like the original and they added a few things that just brought the movie all together! Would definitely watch again in theaters! 💖"
This was a great family movie and a must see I was thoroughly entertained throughout the entire movie honestly a must see
"This movie was beyond amazing! Absolutely loved seeing a black mermaid and her voice is spectacular, the prince voice was amazing also. Great cast"
They missed the part where their in the kitchen and Sebastian gets thrown almost in a pot
"Everything about this movie is just fantastic!!! Amazing actors, every single cast did not disappoint."
We absolutely loved everything about this movie
"It was beautiful 
The best Disney live action ever 
I loved it and I would watch it again"
"Halle shines in this and makes a perfect Ariel. The whole cast does an amazing job especially the actor for Prince Eric. While not without its issues, I think this is Disney's best live action movie."
"It was an absolute blast watching this movie! Sure the CGI and some of the lighting could be better but I was laughing and having a ton of fun watching it. Halle Bailey’s voice is utterly breath taking. The changes they made definitely fit the movie better and you can tell the cast had so much fun making it. At the end, kids and adults (including me) in the theater were applauding. Honestly feel like it’s the best live action remake Disney has done so far. Will definitely watch it again"
It was so good. Definitely recommend!
"Beautiful remake. This movie is the perfect example of diversity, equality, and inclusion. Miss Halle was flawless and Ursula amazing."
I liked this movie SO MUCH. Definitely one of the best live action Disney films so far.
For a remake it was very well done. Great graphics and music and love that they stuck to the original but managed to add parts that didnt take away from the story. Definitely a great updated version. Family fun
I loved everything about The Little Mermaid and was so happy to see the different cultures represented throughout. The vocals and music were amazing as well as animation. I laughed and almost cried on a few parts. It was definitely worth the wait! Now I just need it on DVD for my car )
HALLE DID AN AMAZING JOB :’) LOVE LOVE LOVE would watch again 100%💝💝
"I’m not a big fan of most of the Disney live-action remakes, but this one is GOOOOD!!! It’s maybe even better than the original cartoon one. Well, maybe not that good, but gosh it was good. I can’t imagine it NOT going on to make a billion dollars. It might even make 2 billion! The graphics are more visually stunning than Avatar, and the romance is more gripping and tear-jerking than Titanic. It couldn’t exactly replicate some of the classic scenes from the original cartoon because some things that work for cartoons don’t really work for live-action. But they found the things that do work with live-action and made it work. They did a good job with this one!"
"wow wow wow, saying Halle did that role justice is an understatement! the entire case brought the magic we love from the original movie, with a colorful imaginative twist! 1000/10!🤩"
We love it! Good job Halle! Brings me back to my childhood.
"OMG…. Where do I start! Graphics, nostalgic, action packed, the MUSIC was amazinggggg!!! I love how it connected to the original, the movie was all around great from the beginning to the end! Well don’t cast."
It was a great love action adaptation!! Halle did a great job!
"I loved that it followed the original movie. The new scenes went great and was cohesive with the original. Halle did amazing and Ursula played the role to the T! Great movie, I will see again!"
I saw the movie with my kids in 3D it was beautiful the underwater scenes were amazing !! Melissa McCarthy played Ursula very well . All around a good movie not sure about 2D but 3D was really awesome !!
Videography & CGI were outstanding. The musical performances were spectacular. Add'l songs & lyrics fit seamlessly.
Amazing!!!!! Just BEAUTIFUL ❤️😫
Absolutely loved it. My grand babies loved it as well. I will be going back to see it again.
I was hesitant to watch this being a man and 42 years old but I cracked a tear at the end. It was very good and heartwarming
Absolutely wonderful.
"An all around good time! Stop overthinking it, just go watch and have fun. Listening to Halle Bailey sing is worth the price of admission alone."
This movie was everything I imagined it would be. My 4 year old enjoyed it so much !
Loved every single bit
Loved the theatre! It was awesome!
In typical Disney fashion the story was great and the production was outstanding. There were spots where the movie got a little disjointed.
loved it! although they change a few things from the original
10/10 best Disney remake ever!! Goosebumps
The acting was quite impressive (especially Melissa McCarthy). It was done very well and the nostalgia I felt even made me tear up a few times.
"I think this would have been an amazing movie if we got to finish it, unfortunately the theater had the volume so loud the kids were literally crying and not just the ones with me. The ocean scenes were stunning, the Ariel was beautiful and seemed to play the part beautifully. I do feel it was a little too grown up for the kids to follow but over all I think it would have been a pretty great movie if not for a bad theater experience but we will watch at home when it’s available for sure."
Great Great movie !!!!!!
The little mermaid was a beautiful movie. I enjoy every moment. I laughed and I cried. Halle Bailey was amazing😍
loved loved loved the movie!!
Absolutely amazing movie! It was a bit different than the original but done so well!!
I loved it. The Little Mermaid was the first movie I ever saw in the theater when I was little and I was brought right back to being a kid again. They did an amazing job with the casting. A few new surprises but they really did this classic justice
It was really fun! Loved the musical numbers and loveeed Halle Bailey as ariel. She was really great! My only complaint would be that some scenes were a little too dark a few times. But there were a lot of bright and colorful scenes!
Go see it! Worth it! Go Hailey
everyone needs to see it. Halle played Ariel so well. it’s amazing. transcendent truly
"The Little Mermaid remake is a magical fairytale with breathtaking underwater sequences and beautiful romance. The film does fall short of the animated original at times, and the live action fish characters take a bit to get used to. However, the songs brought tears to the audience (especially Hallie Bailey’s Part of Your World) and the set design and performance from Bailey transports you to a classic fairytale brought to life. I recommend this film for a family night at the movies."
Everyone I hoped it would be. Magical
one of the better live action Disney adaptions in my book (the other being jungle book). felt halle bailey was fantastic as Ariel despite the online trolls who wanted to scream WOKE and review bomb the movie. it kept ALL  the songs from the original movie and added some of its own tbh kinda feels like its own thing. give it a shot y'all
Loved the cinematography...great new songs by Lin Manuel
"It's a kids movie so, you gotta look at it that way lol. Very colorful and whimsical, I thought that animal characters were funny! I was entertained,  its a good family movie."
Great movie!!!  The movie represented everyone!!
"Just watched The Little Mermaid 🧜‍♀️ It lacked personal and/or emotional connection with Ariel & Eric. There are other scenes that can be better. However, I cried toward the end because a Father’s love is greater than the deepest ocean 🌊 in the world. So that was a plus! The movie is different in other aspects of the storyline, and was very interesting to watch. Overall, the movie  🍿 was great and very good for the family & especially kids! Ariel (Halle) had the most beautiful voice, so influential, mesmerizing, catching, and amazing! She’s adorable, sweet, wonderful, beautiful, and lovable. Regardless, I would still give this movie 🎥 a 9/10 😘😝"
"Beautiful Cgi and fun songs, loved the actors"
It was pretty amazing! Best live action Disney movie ever!!! Super close to the movie! I loved every minute of it!
Halle Bailey was amazing! Movie 10/10 🔥the definition of a great life action movie
"The movie kept mostly to the original Disney animated film, which made this fan very happy. The updates are minimal except for one plot point, and I won't spoil it but it has to do with the ending. it doesn't stray too far from what viewers know and love."
"Wonderful modern take on a Disney classic! The acting was fantastic, especially Halle and Melissa. The climax needed a little finessing, but otherwise, a true delight. I'm so glad this generation gets to see such unity on screen."
Amazing my girls loved it
It was great to see Halle Bailey as Ariel. She did a n amazing job!
Soooo amazing!!! I’m SPEACHLESS! Hallie was so great! Wonderful! Just wonderful!
"Best live action remake so far. Love the way Ariel and Eric are full people, the acting is top notch- music is amazing- Under the Sea is visually spectacular. Seen it twice so far in theaters. Will be one we watch again and again. Halle is a perfect Ariel."
The detail and effects were spot on!
"OMG, this movie was so good!!  I recommend going to see it!"
Very well done! Thats a tough movie to create for live action. It was perfect!
incredibly done! music and color coming together to produce a beautiful piece! brings a smile to those of ALL ages!
Best movie I ever saw!! It gave me chills 🥰
Halle Bailey is a phenomenal talent and the film was pure fun!
Cinematography and graphics were outstanding underwater scenes were especially imaginative
Best live action remake by far!! Thank you for doing justice to my favorite childhood Disney story!
The music was great. Story was great.  Loved all the characters.
"Absolutely amazing!! Astounding , and Beautiful. So proud of you Halle Bailey . Did an amazing job"
The animation was so good and I love how much they changed but also how much they kept the same. Its definitely a favorite for me!
I absolutely loved it. Way better than I was expecting
"Amazing!! The action scenes were great. Couldve done without Prince Erics song, but overall loved it."
They did a real good job on this one the whole family loved it and it stayed pretty true to the cartoon
"Oh my gosh. I loved every second of this movie. Every new song was good, every original song was done justice. Halle and Jonah are phenomenal as Ariel and Eric! Even my mom loved it more than she thought she would. We're definitely gonna go see it again. Best live Action disney remake so far! I'm so happy 😭"
Most enjoyable Disney remake in a very long time. Perhaps a better watch than the animated original.
"This movie was cute. Nothing beats the original, but this one definitely sparks some nostalgia."
Best live action Disney movie ever!!!!!!!!!!!!
"halle bailey is a star, there is truly no better casting than her. this movie has all the elements you love about the original but rob marshall manages to bring his own delightful twist to it. i’ll definitely be rewatching this soon."
Amazing!  Halle Bailey is a perfect Ariel. She's truly a Fisney Princess with the voice of an angel.
"Main actress lacked charisma, no romantic chemistry between leads, 
Good choice of Melissa McCarthy as Ursula and Javier Bardem as Triton."
"The cast is phenomenal! Loved every minute of the film. Colorful, delightful and engaging. Halle Bailey is perfect for the role of Ariel. Her voice is beautiful.  Melissa McCarthy's  portrayal of Ursula is beyond my expectations. My family absolutely loved the film. Bravo to everyone involved. The amount of effort that went into making this film came through on the screen."
Great remake. Ursula and Ariel are great! still prefer OG Ursula.
One of the best Disney remakes ever!
It was amazing! Halle is Ariel!!!!!! It was sooo good!
Absolutely amazing! The whole cast did incredible! I will be seeing this many more times in theaters and getting the dvd!!!
not as accurate to the original as i was expecting. definitely overhyped not too entertaining
"The original animated film has always been so near and dear to my heart, and I think this adapted remake compliments the original while still made into its own! Sure, some songs were rewritten/removed or some of the underwater sequences looked funny, but I appreciate how they expanded some of the characters and their motives and made more modern story choices. After seeing this film, I couldn't imagine anyone else playing Ariel better than Halle Bailey. She embodied so much of Ariel's personality, with a stellar voice. Might see this again over the weekend!"
It's not the greatest live action but it's entertaining enough to at least watch once. It's not a frame by frame adaptation and sometimes the acting could be better but overall I don't feel like I completely wasted my time.
It was everything and more… So beautiful and I could not stop watching. This is a wonderful movies
they stayed true to the original with some of the dialogue and even added two extra songs! i don’t care what y’all say but this is the best live action remake and Halle Berry OWNED this period point blank
"Fantastic film! Halle Bailey is incredible as Ariel, the entire cast was perfect. The songs, the score, the added story elements were everything I hoped for. I will be seeing this one over and over again in the theater!"
I liked the full movie
Loved it. My family enjoyed every min.
"Not only is this the best Disney live action adaptation, it’s the best film Disney has released in years. It honored and heightened the original and left me singing and dancing as I left the theater. This is a perfect film for the summer!"
It was so beautifully amazing 🤩
Loved how true they stayed to the original story line while still incorporating a way more diverse cast.
Sebastian was the highlight!
Breathtaking and beautiful
"Visually  stunning, beautiful music---Lots of fun!!!"
Did not disappoint! Absolutely LOVED it!!
Such a beautiful rendition of the original . Halle Bailey and Melissa McCarthy pulled off such a great performance!
So many tears. Disney did it right! ❤️❤️❤️
Absolutely beautiful!!! Best Disney live action film to date.
This movie was awesome! Halle shines as a newer version of Ariel. The Diversity in the film was well placed and even the music was wonderful. Melissa made a great Ursula and the movie was well paced! I smiled the entire time! Definitely a go see!
"Healing my inner child. Waited five years, since Halle was announced as Ariel and I couldn't be happier with how it all turned out."
Amazing movie. Loves the animations and the acting. It was really fantastic.
I love how they kept to the animation but added new songs. CGI was horrible at times but watchable. Loved the movie.
I liked everything from the beginning to the end. Amazing performance from everyone ❤️❤️❤️❤️
It was a awesome remake!!!
"It was a great movie, visually, musically and acting was great I don’t know what all the hoopla was about Ariel….Halle Bailey was great"
Don’t let the internet fool you into thinking this movie isn’t good. Everything about this movie for the time is awesome! If you are stuck on the 1989 version of The Little Mermaid. Remind yourself that it was a cartoon and nobody knows what a mermaid looks like. So don’t cheat yourself or your kids by not experiencing this film.
A Modern Fantastic movie and beautifully cast!! Well done!
I’ve waited so long for this movie and it was even better than I thought it would be. Hallie did her thing! And Melissa McCartney was great too!!
"This is a reimagining of a family classic. Halle, Melissa, and the whole cast bring the story to new heights. Melissa brings her humor to the character of Ursula while Halle embodies Ariel with the voice of the Gods."
Great movie! Halle Bailey was AMAZING as Ariel
"The Little Mermaid was amazing! Halle Bailey is a real life Disney princess, you can’t tell me otherwise and Melissa McCarthy did a phenomenal job as Ursula. 🧜🏾‍♀️📽️🍿"
So so good! This was my second time seeing it in imax and it was even more amazing than my first viewing. Beautiful story and so worth the watch!
I’m beyond excited to see the smile on every little girl that walked past my granddaughter and I. The movie did a great job in casting people that represent us ALL.
I absolutely loved this new version of the movie. The graphics and colors are well done. And the 3 new songs from Lin Manuel Miranda are great! So glad I went to see it
"It was amazing!! With all the negative comments before the release of the movie I didnt expect much. I loved everything about it, I wouldn't change anything"
It's a great movie for everyone!!! 10-10Bring your family and your kiddos will love the movielove the bright colors and the effects as well. Great job Disney!!!!!!
It was a beautiful movie! I just wished this version of the movie had been around when my daughter was little.
I loved this movie it was so fun and I just cant explain how  fun it was Ursula was a little scary but I loved this movie I totally recommend watching it!!
The little Mermaid was pack with excitement and beautiful graphics! Definitely recommend it!
Melissa McCarthy nailed it as Ursula.
Must see! Halle is AMAZING! Great retelling. 😃
The perfect amount of nostalgia mixed with a modern tale on a classic! Halle Bailey is amazing and the cast made it a 10/10!!!
"The trailer did not give this movie the justice it deserved. Wonderfully done! would see it in theaters again, but only in 3D this time 😁"
AMAZING!!! Great great!!!
It was an amazing movie. Everyone clapped at the end!
Extra adorable remake. Halle was the perfect mermaid. And how could we not love Sebastian?!
Loved the movie. The actors. The graphics. The music.
Great movies the children loved it
"Ok as a Trump supporting Christian the movie was good,nah great. The screens in the movie were very beautiful. Melissa McCarthy was an Amazing Ursla!
Movie was actually good.."
king trident with all the power of the oceans couldn't put his daughter that he gave his died for a new dress or a rainbow ? and where was the chef v sebastian fights ? other than that it was cute
A well done remake.  Halle Bailey did a marvelous job as Ariel.  We were disappointed that Under the Sea didn't have many animals singing but the rest of it made up for it.
So good!! Omg better than I expected!
Faithful to the original. Highly entertaining
I really enjoyed the live version and cast of the little mermaid.. the scene when Ursula becomes a giant in the water is awesome.. that was one of the scenes I didn’t think they would be able to fulfill. But they did and the movie was awesome!!
Amazing movie. Great cast I found myself more engaged than my children.
Oh my goodness 🤩 I absolutely loved it! Going again and again.
Great movie! Daughter loved the music
It was absolutely amazing loved everything they did a fabulous job on this movie .
"As a long time Little Mermaid fan/obsesser, I loved this movie. After we all got over the appearances of Ariels friends, the songs were almost the same as the old movie with a couple fun new ones. A lot of lines and scenes were also an exact match to the original film which I really enjoyed. Only comment is that Ursula is terrifying near the end, especially if youre taking young ones."
So good.  Daveed Diggs as Sebastian was a brilliant choice.  The updated music is 10/10.
The soundtrack makes you dance in your seat! The visual effects made you feel like you were in a coral reef and the casting was spectacular!
"This movie was even better than the original!!! I loved it so much! The music, the story, it was superb!"
"If Disney is going to keep releasing live-action remakes, and they will, then this is how they should do it, with attention to detail in every aspect of the film, improving on elements from the past but keeping what worked. Dion Beebe used the fact that characters were suspended in water to film conversations in a completely new light, but captured the landscapes above with an equally enthralling grandeur. The musical sequences could hardly have been better, and the movie was more romantic than I could have expected."
It exceeded my expectations for a live remake! Can't wait to see it again in 3D!
I loved that the main character was black. There was no discrimination and representation of all backgrounds were present in the film.
Ready to rewatch already and it’s not even over!
Amazing kiddos loved it
Very good movie. Beautiful singing
"I have been waiting for this movie to come out and it did not disappoint!  Halle's voice was perfect for role.  I loved the music, beautiful costumes, colorful scenery, and the love story.  I was also very pleased to see the diversity and multiculturalism represented throughout. It was an honor to support this film during opening week. 

Sebastion and Founder were phenomenal in their supporting roles. So cute, I loved them!

Don't hesitate, go see this movie!"
Wonderful 👏🏽 Just like the original except for the obvious. Music was also the same. Well done.
"Sooo Good! Everybody’s acting was great, the characters were great, the music were great. I loved it and just So proud and happy for Halle! Go see it!"
"LOVE LOVE LOVEEEEEE HALLE IN THIS ANS RHE OTHERS! MY INNER CHILD WAS HEALED AT THE END, SO LOVELY"
"I enjoyed it, the actress who played Ariel did an excellent job as the character and the songs were done beautifully throughout the film"
"So good! I loved it! Halle has an amazing voice, the chemistry between her and Jonah is great, Melissa is spot on as evil Ursula and the cameo is perfect for this movie."
"I loved the Little Mermaid movie, I'd definitely see it again. I liked that the mermaids were of different colors, it was just an all around good movie."
YES YES YES. JUST YES
The scary stuff was way over the top.  Ruined it completely.
Loved it! Even all the added scenes from the original! Amazing and so funny!!!
Halle Bailey is stunning and perfect as Ariel! Disney had nailed this live action version!! I even danced and was singing in the theater!
"Overall, it was a good updated version of the movie. The CG was beautiful and vibrant. The casting of the main characters was good and each brought their own flair to the movie. The only criticism is it was slow in the beginning."
It was a phenomenal movie definitely one of the best live action that Disney has done. They did a great job for telling the story while still putting in modern spin on it.
Don’t believe the negative reviews. Incredible!!!!
A MUST SEE. We loved it! It was amazing to see the scenes of the movie come to life. Halle Bailey was perfect for this role and was excellent as Ariel. Don’t think no about it. Just got!
love the movie and music
culturally stunning!!
Excellent adaptation on the original! Loved the diverse cast! Good job Disney!
Halle voice is incredible   I really enjoyed the movie...watched it in 3D
"great movie. you will enjoy it. period. music, Sebastian, Ariel, mhmm."
"Exactly, how I remember it from my childhood! Disney never fails with their casting."
"The movie was excellent. Halle did a fantastic job. I couldn’t be more proud of her. She captured Ariel perfectly. Her voice and her acting, when she lost her voice were excellent. The chemistry with Jonah was spectacular. The new songs felt like they were already in the original, except for the scuttlebutt, but even that wasn’t that bad in the movie. Overall I loved it!"
It was great to see an African American woman play Ariel which was my reason for going because representation in this climate is important. I’ve never watched the animated version and I dozed off for most of the film but I’m happy to support the film
Halle’s singing really just goes straight through your heart. This movie was perfectly remade.
This movie was everything I hoped for and more. I’m in love!
"Absolutely stunning movie , Halle was amazing in this, her voice , the acting , the music , everything was top tier"
Best Live Action Disney movie ♥️♥️♥️
"Halle Bailey is beautiful.
Melissa McCarthy is excellent as Ursula.
The actor who played Eric did a good job.
Scuttle and Sebastian were hilarious.
The CGI was horrible but the movie was still entertaining. 
I prefer the 2nd half of the movie rather than the 1st half."
"This was my second time seeing it, noticed a lot more small details. Loved it so much, Halle was just incredible and loved Daveed as Sebastian"
"I’ve seen this movie twice already and still can’t get enough of it. Yes it is THAT GOOD. Halle is so amazing as Ariel, and there is so much laughter in this film. Along with all our favorite songs."
I loved that they kept most of the scenes from the original mermaid and I loved the ending
I hope the people who hate this movie simply because the lead is of color know that you’re going to rot for having such hatred inside of you. You guys are disgusting and the problem with the world. This movie is beautiful and honestly more entertaining than the original.
"an absolute must see, halle bailey is a star, this movie is everything"
One of the best reimaginings. Maybe the best. They replicated a lot of shots while still providing fresh material. The character designs were really good and all the undersea scenes were so beautiful.
The Little Mermaid is entertaining . Halle Bailey is amazing as Ariel!
"The undersea world is beautiful. Some of it is dark, yes. Not only is that more realistic, I think it's an artistic way of showing how sad & out of place Ariel feels. She longs to know more about the surface world & explore. The lighting difference up there shows how the curiosity brightens up her heart & her happiness in finding a place she belongs. It's a beautiful & creative way to showcase this. And that just because we may be different, that doesn't make us enemies. Also, the song they added For the First Time is awesome. My son is hard of hearing & mostly nonverbal. I can't wait to watch this with him"
"Alright. Here we go. I just saw an advanced screening of #TheLittleMermaid and I really enjoyed it! Halle Bailey IS Ariel! She has a commanding voice, and really channeled the animated Ariel very well!! Part Of Your World is truly something special by her. I thought her performance was magnificent. Daveed Diggs as Sebastian was pure gold! I couldn’t get enough of him! And Melissa McCarthy as Ursula was a great choice! Poor Unfortunate Souls by her was Pitch Perfect! Now there are some new songs in this live action version. And they were fine. I was not a fan of Eric’s song, but it was passable. The look of the sea and the vibrant colors, really popped! I honestly think it’s better than Avatar 2’s visuals. But to each their own. I saw this in 3D and I was annoyed that the screening was in 3D, but I honestly thought it ADDED a nice bit to some of the ocean scenes. Do I think this movie is better than the original? In some ways, yes. In others no. But overall, I know kids will absolutely enjoy this movie, and adults who grew up with the original classic, will get a kick out of it. Also, kudos to Disney and their new #Disney100 opening! I enjoyed that so much! So many little easter eggs in that alone! I give The Little Mermaid: 4 Dinglehoppers Out of 5. #Review #MovieReview The Little Mermaid hits theaters this Friday. Thanks to Disney for the Advanced Screening Passes. 

Side note: I lost a very close friend of mine a few years ago. And she loved The Little Mermaid. I know she would have loved this movie. To my heavenly mermaid, Amy 🫶🏽🧜‍♀️"
"Awesome performances (acting + singing) from Halle Bailey and Melissa McCarthy. They are Ariel and Ursula. Daveed Diggs is fun and great as Sebastian as well as Awkwafina as Scuttle. I enjoyed all but one of the newly added scenes which leads into one of My criticisms. I wasn't feeling the new song for Prince Eric. I think My only other issue is that the CGI looks great at times and then not so much other times. Other than that, go check it out in IMAX or Dolby."
"I was a bit hesitant about a live action, but its a bit different from the original. Highly recommend."
"While I’ve enjoyed some of the live actions remakes, this is the first time I’ve felt like we’ve seen a princess come to life! Halle’s performance is worth the prices of a ticket alone! I enjoyed see all of the numbers adapted to real life and even found myself trying to see along to some of the new songs. Definitely a must watch."
Fantastic film which lived up to my expectations!
"The animated version was much better! The romantic leads seemed mismatched, so I did not really care whether they got together or not.
The music was still beautiful, the Kiss the Girl scene was magical.
I would definitely see it in IMAX, the water scenes are definitely enhanced by it."
"Son of a fish, this Disney remake actually slaps like a tsunami. Rob Marshall succeeds where a lot of these Disney remakes fail. It elevates the past mistakes and adds depth to parts that need it. While not flawless, The Little Mermaid is exactly what all of these remakes should strive to be."
CGI was a little off but other than that great experience and execution.
Good family movie. Pays good tribute to classic but classic is still in a league of it’s own
"WHY WHY WHY DISNEY? DO YOU KEEP MAKING LIVE ACTION REMAKESYou'd think a company like Disney with the amount of money and resources that they have to draw upon would be able to develop some original ideas but no nope, here's another live action remake. The biggest issue straight out of the gate is that much like pretty much all these live action remakes is that it didn't need to be made. If I want to watch any of the films that have been re made then 9 times out of 10 I'm going to watch the original animation, they're just classics with heart that can't be re created in live action. That being said this film exists and I have limitless so may as well watch it.

Another big issue I had with this film is the pacing, it's a 2hrs 15 mins kids film and with the attention span that kids have today even if it was well paced kids would be bored by the end. This film to me felt like it had a lot of filler particularly once (spoiler) Arial gets her legs in the second act and none of it was that interesting. For me the film didn't add anything that would have made the animation better if it had been in there. That being said this film isn't a total loss, Halle Bailey (not Halle Berry 🐱) is great as arial, when she hits the high note in part of your world I couldn't help but be amazed. In fact that song was probably the stand out scene of the film for me, it was brilliantly recreated.

Bailey is also forced to convey the emotion of her character for a large part of the film just with her eyes and she does a great job of it. I also felt Melisa McCarthy was great as Ursula although I felt her character was underused in what was ultimately an anti-climatic final act. I do want to give a special to mention to Javier Bardem as he gives probably the flattest performance of his entire career as a King Triton. I genuinely got the impression from his performance that he didn't really want to be in this film and to be honest I can't blame him as much like his performance the film feels largely flat for the most part."
"It's hard to rateI went to see this movie with the attitude that it's gonna be the worst Disney Live Action movie.

As I was watching it, I noticed that I don't hate it, but there is also a lot of things that don't work.

Sebasitan and. Flounder look hideous, I have no idea what they were thinking. Straight up CGI fish and crab.

Songs are bad. Halle Bailey has great voice, and can sing, but other than that, the songs are terrible. A lot of times actors singing go out of tune or lose rythm mostly because the line doesn't really fit the music.

Scuttlebutt song made my ears bleed, I also wanted to scratch my eyes out and this scene just wouldn't end.

Visuals are good, but everything is washed out and dark that you can't really appreciate the CGI which is surprisingly good for an disney movie.

Some things are taken straight from the original and some are changed to make more sense because they wanted this movie to have more diverse cast, and at least these changes are made to make it fit.

But still it's not as good as the original, some new things added don't recompensate the things that were cut out.

Had like 4 laughs, but nothing to write home about.

Could've been better."
"A Shallow Dive That Missed its MarkThis live action remake was a disappointing attempt to bring a beloved Disney classic to life. It falls flat in almost every aspect, leaving me feeling underwhelmed and disconnected, unlike the original.

Halle Bailey as Ariel was good and Melissa McCarthy as Ursula was passable but beside those two, all of the other characters felt virtually nonexistent with zero chemistry with one another.

Visually, the remake falls short in creating a believable underwater world. The CGI effects were uninspiring and more importantly, looked cheap.

What 'The Little Mermaid' suffered from the most was the god awful script. The pacing was uneven, scenes dragged on or failed to contribute to the overall narrative, and the characters felt shallow and lacked depth.

Overall, the 2023 remake was lackluster and forgettable. The uninspiring performances, poor visual effects, and terrible original songs left me disengaged and disappointed. Don't let the positive reviews the film has been receiving gaslight you into thinking that these awful cash grab live-action remakes that Disney has been producing are okay. The truth is the film fails to capture the magic and charm that made the original film so beloved, which is on par with all the other Disney remakes."
"Uninspired, disappointing.I saw this movie openining night. I have always loved The Little Mermaid and I was really holding out hopes that this one would surprise me in a good way.

Unfortunately it's as bland and unmagical as the other recent live action remakes. There is no color, no heart, no care in this movie. It's an insult to the original and it does nothing new or fresh to define itself. The things it does try to do new, are at complete odds with its own worldbuilding.

I enjoyed Sebastian and Ursula, but overall I regretted going to see this. I have never walked out of a movie before, but this one tempted me to leave multiple times.

People were checking their phones. Children were talking and wandering around the theatre. What else do you need to know that this movie was downright boring?

There's no excuse for such sloppy movies. And yet here we are, once again, with another boring remake. I honestly never want to watch this movie again. The reviewers aren't being harsh or unfair. This movie was legitimately bad."
"Dark and GloomyNo excitement or joy. Maybe the movie was rushed, but no real story line either. Poorly done.do not recommend. Most of the kids in the theater were bored and playing. Others were on third iPad or phones. Kinda sad!

I wish it was more for kids. Seemed like a social statement rather than a movie for kids. Disney needs to get back to the children, where is the laughter and joy?

I would have left early but fell asleep. Several folks slept through it as well. Sad indictment of the movie. Heard lots of folks talking about the positivity of a lead African American actress but even they said the movie was not good. Good effort - poor delivery."
"This is one of the best Disney live action remakesThe Little Mermaid (2023) is a movie that my daughter and I saw in theaters last night. The storyline follows a mermaid princess obsessed with the surface and humans. When a Prince's boat crashes and she saves him she becomes even more obsessed with him and the ways of humans against her father's advice. She makes a deal with a sea witch to become human for three days but if the prince doesn't kiss her in that time, she will return to the ocean to be the witch's slave forever. Can the mermaid uncover the ways of the humans and find true love?

This movie is directed by Rob Marshall (Chicago) and stars Halle Bailey (Last Holiday), Jonah Hauer-King (A Dog's Way Home), Melissa McCarthy (The Heat), Javier Bardem (No Country for Old Man), Noma Dumezweni (Dirty Pretty Things) and Awkwafina (Crazy Rich Asians).

This live action remake is beautifully executed with tremendous CGI, storytelling and use of color. Seeing this in 3D was a treat too. The storyline aligned to this animated film perfectly with some good additions. I loved the depiction of the island life and struggles of the humans and mermaids and their mutual perception of each other. I did miss the cook from the cartoon. The new songs were hit or miss. I can't say I enjoyed Eric's song, Halle's new songs worked and I actually enjoyed the rap. The back and forth between Sebastian and Scuttle was hilarious and well written. Melissa McCarthy was a fantastic Ursula and how she was depicted was perfect, especially at the very end.

Overall, this is one of the best Disney live action remakes. I would score this a strong 8-8.5/10 and strongly recommend it."
"Some things are better left aloneI'll start with this, Halle Bailey was fantastic. She was cast perfectly as Ariel with her tender voice and childlike charm. I think the entire cast did well given what they had to work with. My issue is that in most cases I feel these live action remakes are not able to capture the essence of their original counterparts. Little Mermaid is no exception, it was fun and colorful to watch but again I felt like something was missing. By the second half of the film I was counting down the time I'd be able to get to my bed. The film just never connected with me. And I almost feel like I would have been perfectly fine without this remake."
"Unapologetically mediocreThe Little Mermaid is like a Disney parade, a Bridgerton Broadway show, a Hallmark movie and an aquarium themed screensaver.

The most shocking in this film is the visual incoherence between the ocean world and the human world. The ocean is all horrible cgi hair and crazy psychedelic colors but it feels like a proper universe. On the other hand the human world is insanely cheap looking, a green screen studio Bridgerton with questionable colonial undertones. The market scene is appalling, so shiny and weirdly modern looking as if you were in a themed tourist trap. The studio lighting makes all the actors look like soap opera extras. I feel so bad for the Eric actor who had to deliver that embarrassing solo that reaches the highest levels of camp. And the edit is so stiff, the acting so stilted it seems the director was inspired by Gone With the Wind.

So sure there are some so-bad-it's-good campy moments like the mermaids group looking like a doll display in a kid's bedroom, or the OTT actress playing human Ursula. But oh boy Javier Bardem looks like an AI gone wrong. His out of the water shots had the whole cinema laughing as you could just imagine him shooting them in a tiny pool trying to look serious with that hobo beard and cheesy shell outfit.

At least Halle/Ariel delivered and Ursula was just what you expected from one of the best Disney villains. I wish the climax was a bit longer because those visuals were stunning.

This new remake won't age well at all as all those unapologetically mediocre cash grabs."

"An insult to the orignalThis movie just wasn't good... They added something like 50 minutes but it didn't improve the movie one it, it only made it drag on.

The CGI is poorly done and the tone of the film is dark and gloomy, not bright and colorful as it should be.

The animal characters look terrible. The changes to the songs are ridiculous, the original lyrics weren't problematic in the slightest.

Scuttle's voice is really jarring and the added song is just bad.

The changes made to the ending make the story worse, not better. They didn't need to make Eric weaker to build up Ariel.

The best thing about the movie was Ursula. At least they didn't ruin her."

"Original is BetterThe Little Mermaid (2023) is a live-action adaptation of Disney's 1989 animated classic, which was loosely based on the fairy tale by Hans Christian Andersen. The movie follows the story of Ariel, a curious and adventurous mermaid who falls in love with Prince Eric, a human she rescues from a shipwreck. To be with him, she makes a deal with Ursula, a wicked sea witch who takes her voice in exchange for human legs. Ariel must win Eric's heart before the time runs out, or else she will lose her soul to Ursula.

The movie is directed by Rob Marshall, who has previously helmed musicals such as Chicago, Into the Woods and Mary Poppins Returns. The screenplay is written by David Magee, who also worked on Finding Neverland and Life of Pi. The music is composed by Alan Menken, who returns to score the film and write new songs with Lin-Manuel Miranda, the creator of Hamilton and Moana.

The cast of the movie features newcomers and veterans alike. Halle Bailey stars as Ariel, making her feature film debut after being discovered by Beyoncé and appearing in the musical duo Chloe x Halle. Jonah Hauer-King plays Prince Eric, a British actor who has appeared in TV shows such as Little Women and World on Fire. Melissa McCarthy portrays Ursula, the iconic villainess who has a penchant for collecting souls and singing showstoppers. Javier Bardem plays King Triton, Ariel's father and the ruler of the underwater kingdom of Atlantica. Daveed Diggs, Awkwafina and Jacob Tremblay lend their voices to Sebastian, Scuttle and Flounder, Ariel's loyal friends and sidekicks. Noma Dumezweni plays Queen Selina, Eric's mother and a new character created for the film.

The movie aims to modernize the classic tale for a new generation of audiences, while staying faithful to the spirit of the original. The movie features new scenes and characters that explore the cultures and backgrounds of Ariel and Eric, as well as their relationship and motivations. The movie also updates some of the songs and dialogue to reflect more contemporary sensibilities and humor.

The movie is a feast for the eyes and ears, with stunning visuals and catchy tunes that will enchant viewers of all ages. The movie showcases the beauty and diversity of the ocean world, as well as the charm and splendor of the human realm. The movie also boasts impressive performances from the cast, especially Bailey, who brings a fresh and captivating take on Ariel. She sings with grace and power, expressing Ariel's longing and joy with every note. McCarthy also delivers a memorable turn as Ursula, who is both menacing and hilarious in her schemes and songs.

However, the movie is not without its flaws. Some of the changes made to the story may not sit well with fans of the original animation or the fairy tale source material. Some of the new scenes and characters feel unnecessary or underdeveloped, while some of the old ones are altered or omitted for no apparent reason. The movie also suffers from some uneven pacing and editing, as well as some questionable choices in cinematography and visual effects. Some of the creature designs are also less than appealing or realistic, especially compared to other recent Disney live-action remakes.

The Little Mermaid (2023) is a fun and entertaining musical fantasy that pays homage to its beloved predecessor while adding some new twists and flavors. It may not be perfect or groundbreaking, but it is a worthy addition to Disney's live-action canon that will surely delight fans old and new."
"My daughter was bored to tearsI took my seven year old to see this last night and she was fine for the first half hour or so and then she became really bored with it. After about an hour and 20 minutes she was asking if we could leave and do something else, that's not a good sign when even young girls don''t like this film.

From my own personal point of view, the film is way too long for kids, the songs are borderline horrific, seriously, whoever thought putting a rap song in a film like the little mermaid was a good idea needs to be sectioned, talk about butchering a classic film score.

The special effects, all I can say is, how has a film with a budget this big been made to look so poor, some of the underwater scenes look like something from a playstation 2 cut scene, they're awful.

The animal characters in this, Scuttle, Sebastian and Flounder are dreadful, they look freaky, not cartoonish or charming, not even realistic, just weird and odd and they really take you out of the film whenever they're on screen.

The performances are fine, no one in this is terrible but the script and the songs they're working with are so sub par that anyone would struggle with it.

I remember, even as a young boy, watching the original Little Mermaid and being absolutely mesmerised by it, where as this one, is dull, boring and lifeless and not just my own daughter, but other peoples kids in the cinema were fidgeting, squirming and complaining at around the 90 minute make of this.

It's far too long to keep most kids entertained and it's not pretty or charming enough to hold their attention for any length of time.

Save your money and take your kids to a theme park or an activity center, they'll have a much better time."
"""A Catastrophic Mess: A Disastrous Movie Experience""This movie was an absolute catastrophe from start to finish. I can confidently say that it was the most mind-numbing, soul-sucking experience I've ever had the misfortune of enduring. From the lackluster plot to the abysmal acting, every aspect of this film fell flat on its face.

The storyline was an incoherent mess, leaving me bewildered and struggling to make sense of what was happening on screen. It seemed like the filmmakers had no idea what they were trying to achieve, resulting in a jumbled mess of disjointed scenes that failed to engage or captivate the audience.

To make matters worse, the performances were nothing short of abominable. The actors seemed like they were sleepwalking through their roles, delivering their lines with zero conviction or emotion. I couldn't help but wonder if they were as bored and uninterested as I was.

The special effects were laughable at best. It's as if they were created using outdated technology from two decades ago. The CGI was painfully obvious, and the practical effects were executed so poorly that they looked downright comical. It was impossible to suspend disbelief and immerse myself in the world of the movie when everything looked so cheap and amateurish.

Furthermore, the dialogue was cringe-inducing. The scriptwriters must have been having an off day, as the lines were cliché-ridden and uninspired. I found myself rolling my eyes at the predictable and unimaginative dialogue that permeated every scene.

Finally, the ending was the ultimate insult. After enduring an excruciatingly boring and confusing plot for what felt like an eternity, I was met with a conclusion that left me feeling cheated and robbed of my time. It was a cop-out, lacking any semblance of resolution or satisfaction.

In summary, this movie is an utter disaster that should be avoided at all costs. It failed to deliver on any level, leaving me frustrated, disappointed, and regretting the moment I decided to give it a chance. Spare yourself the agony and seek entertainment elsewhere."
"Presents a captivating visual spectacleThe underwater adventure presents a captivating visual spectacle infused with the melodious talents of Ms. Ariel, portrayed by Halle Bailey. The live-action adaptation of The Little Mermaid is a stunning production that impeccably captures the essence of the characters while incorporating a touch of uniqueness.

The initial scenes build up anticipation as every character is introduced, except for our beloved Ariel. The film skillfully incorporates Halle Bailey's enchanting voice in the background, staying true to the allure of the mermaid's siren song. Halle Bailey shines brilliantly, much like the sun reflecting on the ocean, with her gentle interpretation of the character. A delightful PG love story unfolds between Ariel and the Prince, one that is sure to captivate audiences.

Although Sebastian and Flounder appear more realistic than anything else in the film, the voice actors are well-cast, and Sebastian, in particular, brings a comical appeal to the story. The movie strikes a balance with ample drama and effectively utilizes music, ensuring that it feels like a complete cinematic experience rather than solely a musical. The songs are delightful and showcase the vocal range of the singers, including Ariel.

All in all, I thoroughly enjoyed watching this film, appreciating its diverse elements. Halle's portrayal of Ariel and her captivating appearance was genuinely stunning. It's a delightful experience for both the younger audience and families, as well as those who cherish a well-crafted Disney movie. I would give The Little Mermaid a rating of 4 out of 5 stars."

"Simply BoringThe Little Mermaid is a good example of what's wrong with Disney these days (at least in my opinion) - besides some casting choices that may rise pro and contra voices (I don't care), this movie is dead like plastic. The songs are stale and uninspired, the special effects department did okay, the actors did okay, but well, the formula of Disney movies is now a walking dead corpse, too many times chewed on. But this is not only a question of modern changes to fit to the taste of zeitgeist but for a long time Disney is like a recycling factory: with every turn of the machine the product gets worse and worse, at least if you don't add something new, fresh and substantial, something creative. So my greatest complain: the music is average, the visuals are average, the story is the typical Disney blabla, the entertaining factor is rather low. A typical movie made from the construction kit branded ""Disney"". But maybe I'm just getting old and grumpy and my by age weakened eyes and heart cannot see the beauty in this, well, product."

"Good singing largely forgettablePretty mid. Halle can really sing like wow she did amazing. But otherwise the movie is pretty slow and generic. Not sure why they added 45 minutes. Prince Eric has all the charisma of a mannequin, and he can't really sing. Ursula was pretty good. Javier Bardem was kind of just reading a script for two hours. Daveed Diggs was great as Sebastian. The cgi was pretty ugly and the movie was kinda dark. I guess the darkness was to hide the bad cgi. Overall though, do not waste your money just wait for it to hit streaming in a couple of months. It's mostly pretty boring, but do check out the soundtrack cause Halle Bailey is fantastic."

"Brilliant adaptation of a classicAll the performances were great - in particular, Halle Bailey, Melissa McCarthy, Daveed Diggs, Javier Bardem. I watched this with my family, and we all enjoyed it. It was well acted and a delight to watch.

I had recently watched the animated version of the Little mermaid at the end of last year, and I felt like ll the key tension points were in this film. Melissa made a particular fun baddy to watch, and she was definitely a sinister Ursula. Halle was an adventurous and brave Ariel - I also loved her physical acting when she had no voice. She portrayed the innocence and interest of someone learning new things really well. I thought the chemistry between her and the love lead (Jonah Hauer-King) was refreshing - it was like a best friend type of love, where they understand each other and have similar curiosities.

Daveed's Sebastian kept the humor coming, and he had me cracking up throughout this film. All in all a great adaptation.

If I had one criticism, I would have preferred to see more of Ariel's interactions with her sisters/siblings. To see how she was different or similar to them.

As an adult, I enjoyed this."
"Just, Eh.I came out of the theater just thinking, eh. Probably the most boring of all the live action remakes thus far. Felt like the actors were just reading from a script rather than true acting. Eric and King Triton were very poorly done. Mermaids tend to lean on the creepy looking side as opposed to being beautiful creatures. Most scenes were very dark and hard to see what was going on. I'm not a huge fan of all the changes made to the original story, but the most annoying change was scuttle, and the new scuttlebutt song was absolutely horrible. Melissa McCarthy was fantastic as Ursula, but they left out some of the best parts with her character."
"No Disney MagicI took my children to watch this over the Memorial Day weekend on Saturday. This does not have the magic of the original Disney cartoon. The actress who played Ariel sings very well but that's about it. There was nothing really memorable about it. I could tell my children, ages 4 and 6, were not enjoying the movie because they kept fidgeting and asking to go to the restroom every 15 minutes and stared longingly at the arcade games as we were walking back. This is in stark contrast to when they are watching the original at home as they will laugh and sing along. My wife was staring at her phone and I almost fell asleep."
"I went in expecting this to be bad and was somehow still disappointedBy far the absolute worst Disney live action remake that has been made. To start with, the changes that were made to where it was set and backstories of characters where just terrible and completely changed the original movie that in my opinion is fantastic. A few changes here and there are great and necessary for these kinds of films but it completely changed the dynamic of the movie and made it terrible.

I can't believe that Lin Manuel Miranda was involved in this films soundtrack as the new songs had no lyrical genius and fell flat completely.

The saving grace of this film was Ursula. I need to find out if Melissa McCarthy is okay after carrying the weight of this film on her back. The only accurate character depiction in the whole story.

How does this have a 7/10 rating? Don't waste your time."
"An Absolute Triumph, Showcasing The Beloved Tale In A Fresh And Captivating WayThis mesmerizing live-action musical, starring the talented Halle Bailey, is an absolute triumph! The Little Mermaid showcases the beloved tale in a fresh and captivating way, with stunning visuals that bring the underwater world to life. The CGI is seamless, creating a truly immersive experience that surpassed my expectations.

In this adaptation of The Little Mermaid, we follow the enchanting journey of Ariel (Halle Bailey), a young mermaid who longs to explore the human world. The film stays true to the heart of the original story, emphasizing themes of self-discovery, love and the importance of staying true to oneself.

The Little Mermaid delivers exceptional performances, breathtaking visuals, and captivating storytelling. Halle Bailey performs remarkably, capturing Ariel's curiosity, spirit, and powerful voice. Casting a Black actress in the iconic role of Ariel is a decisive step toward diversifying the portrayal of princesses on screen. It offers young audiences, particularly Black girls who have rarely seen themselves in mainstream media, a chance to see a character they can deeply identify with, and I love that! The cast is rounded out with renowned actors who bring depth and charm to their respective roles. Tony winner Daveed Diggs gives a comedic, clever and heartfelt performance as Sebastian the Crab. Awkwafina's delightful portrayal of Scuttle the Seagull and Jonah Hauer-King's as Prince Eric brilliantly captures the original characters' essence while bringing their unique charm and charisma to the roles. They skillfully breathe new life into these beloved characters, adding depth and memorable moments that both longtime fans and new audiences will appreciate. The costumes, designed by Colleen Atwood, beautifully capture the underwater kingdom and the human world above. The music score by the talented duo of Oscar winner Alan Menken and Tony winner Lin-Manuel Miranda is magical, seamlessly blending Menken's enchanting melodies with Miranda's vibrant and rhythmic compositions, resulting in an unforgettable and captivating musical experience.

The Little Mermaid carries a powerful message of self-acceptance, courage and pursuing one's dreams. It promotes positive social behavior and portrays relationships built on understanding and empathy.

I give The Little Mermaid 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 5 to 12, plus adults. It releases in theaters on May 26, 2023. Immerse yourself in the enchanting world of Ariel and embark on a magical adventure! By Hanadie K., KIDS FIRST!"
"The Little Mermaid""Ariel"" (Halle Bailey) has longed for a chance to meet with humans but her sagely father ""Triton"" (Javier Bardem) has prohibited this. Undeterred, she witnesses a terrible storm that washes the young prince ""Eric"" (Jonah Hauer-King) overboard. She races to his rescue and leaves him to his people on the beach - both are already in love! On hearing of her latest transgression, dad is now truly furious and loses his temper driving his daughter into the manipulative tentacles of the evil sea witch ""Ursula"" (Melissa McCarthy) who offers her a bargain - three days on land to obtain true love's kiss or a lifetime in her service. Snag? Well, she will not have her beautiful voice, she will be a mute. A combination of magic, duplicity and serendipity plays it's hand now and she ends up close to the prince, having adventures with him and falling even deeper in love - but can she get her kiss? Will the wicked ""Ursula"" let her? First things first - this isn't a patch on the 1989 version. It has a clunky, over-produced, musical theatre feel to it that consists of mediocre acting and some serious over-scoring. The delicacy and charm of the characterisations and songs has been subjected to grand orchestrations and whilst Bailey can certainly sing, the delivery is more about her ability to belt out the songs rather to than imbue them with any emotions relevant to the charm of the story. McCarthy is quite effective - if only she would stay still for five seconds and that leads to the other disappointment with this film. It works perfectly as an animation - why introduce elements of live-action to it? Neither the story nor the film benefit from the cluttering mix of CGI and real visuals. As with the recent remake of ""The Lion King"", the song lyrics, for reasons that don't seem clear to me, have been reworked - this time by the always over-rated Lin-Manuel Miranda whose ""Scuttlebutt"" song is just plain annoying. It wasn't broke - why fix it? At times there is a little engaging chemistry between Bailey and Hauer-King, but for the most part this is an unnecessary, and overly long, rehash of a fairy tale that seems to me to have been made because it could be, not because it should have been. Disappointing."

"The Little Mermaid ( 8.4 )The Little Mermaid of 2023 is better than the original, it has great performances, very good songs, perfect chemistry between the characters and amazing special effects, but there are two mistakes that did not make this perfect film and both revolve around the rushed length. Even though they have great chemistry and form an excellent couple, Eric and Ariel's relationship in the final act happened very fast, they are very cute together but they just met and already give up their respective worlds for a new love, their relationship happened very fast, but something that made me even more angry was the last act itself very, very rushed. Ursula is a great villain, but they wiped her out so quickly and effortlessly in one quick scene, it left me really, really disappointed. The movie is full of references and easter eggs, it was really cool to see Jodi Benson. The jokes are very funny, especially the cute trio Sebastian, Flounder and Scuttle. These three characters, as well as Eric and Grimsby are further explored and more interesting here in the film. Overall, it was a great movie and an excellent remake, all the characters in the movie have their own charm and they are all really nice, I can't decide on a favorite just like in the original movie. The performances are impeccable, especially by Halle Bailey and Melissa McCarthy. Halle was a great Ariel and didn't deserve all this hate. I hope they make a sequel because this magical world still has a lot to be explored and it should. It was great to introduce these old characters to a new generation."

"Another pointless remake that's worse than the originalThe latest in Disney's attempt to cash in on all their old IPs instead of making something new and originals has finally hit the screens and it's bad.

A far cry from the bright captivating colors of the original, this ocean is dark and muted. Have the animators even visited a coral reef before? Or are they just trying to hide imperfect CGI by just turning down the color and brightness? Perhaps they should watch Avatar 2 to see how to do a live action amazing underwater world right. The live action aspect actively hurts the film due to making the non-human characters unexpressive at best, uncanny valley at worst.

The run time is bloated, and although they have added some extra things in to fill the time, you kind of wish on the whole that they didn't. The rap song is particularly awful and doesn't feel like it fits at all with the rest of the music in the film.

Like many that have gone before, there's no particular reason for this live action remake to exist apart from being nostalgia bait. Give it a miss and watch the original instead. It's cheaper to watch and a much better movie."
"Amazing live action adaptation with great musical and colorful visuals.5 out of 5 stars.

The Little Mermaid is an awesome musical fantasy film that lives up to the original film. The story is similiar. The musical sequences are also amazing. The cast ensemble is great. Halle Berry does a great job as Ariel which her performance is lovable and well deserved. The music is great. Sure they added some new sequences that also works with the film. The visual effects are great and colorful. The film does have some exciting action sequences that works great. This live action adaptation delivers the under the sea magic. This film is definitely worth checking out if you enjoy the original."
"Mixed Bag of Good and Bad 6.5/10The Little Mermaid live-action remake is a mixed bag of good and bad. It gets off to a rough start, but ultimately, I liked the movie well enough. There were moments where I thought to myself, ""Disney can do better than this."" And then there were other moments where some of that Disney magic shined through. Let's start with the positives.

The Positives.

This is a very romantic movie. Ariel and Eric's relationship is sweet and charming, just like the characters themselves. It turns out, Halle Bailey is a fantastic Ariel. She embodies the characteristics of the beloved character. There is a sweetness, innocence, liveliness, and kindness about her that seems so natural.

Furthermore, the girl can sing. The movie already had a good soundtrack to work with, and her singing talent took that to another level. Jonah Hauer-King isn't a half bad singer himself. I loved his original song as Prince Eric. I think these live-action disney remakes are worth the time largely because of the music. The old songs are beloved, and the new songs are catchy and well-written. I wouldn't have complained if there was more music.

The Negatives It takes a little while for this movie to get out of the muck. Javier Bardem seems like he doesn't know what to do with the character of King Triton. He's so serious and his interactions with other characters are awkward. He often feels like a villain.

As for Ariel's sea creature companions, this is a Sebastian and Scuttle show. Flounder is a pointless character in this story. And even Sebastian and Scuttle, as fun as they are, take some time to get used to. Daveed Diggs does a great job with his voice acting, but it's just not Sebastian's very famous voice. I started getting used to it near the end. Speaking of very famous voices, all I could hear was Awkwafina when Scuttle talked. Sometimes a star can get in the way of their character in such a way, but she is the greatest source of humor in a movie that isn't extremely funny. Its sense of humor is cute and entertaining, but I didn't hear any bursts of laughter in the crowded theater I was in.

As for the much worried about CGI, it definitely doesn't deserve to win any awards, but it didn't distract me all that much either.

I wish this were a more consistent movie, but there is enough good to make it worth your time."
"The long waiting was not worthwhileOne actress is not enough to save a movie even if she plays the main character. This happens all the time and this remake is proof of it. The weakest thing in this version, of course, is the CGI characters. I thought the worst thing ever seen in these remakes was the dog from 2019's Lady and the Tramp, but this Flounder is outrageous. It's the Jar Jar Binks of Disney's remakes. And this Sebastian looks odd and graceless. Three years and Disney couldn't do any better? Are you serious? In overall, the underwater scenes are not what I expected to see and, as some critic says, ""recreated with Windows 10 screensaver graphics"".

Now let me explain what is the problem with Ursula. In an animated feature you can exaggerate the expressions any way you like but you can't do that in live action. This is not Melissa McCarthy's fault, of course, but I don't lend ears to those who praise her performance with biased reasonings. And the changes in the final scene were simply the last straw but I won't spoil anything here. Seriously, I couldn't believe it when I watched it.

In summary, the movie doesn't work because Halle Bailey is surrounded by things that don't work. And that's not Halle's fault, it's all Disney's fault."
"I was excited and was left a disappointedI was looking forward to this live Disney remake.

I loved the choice of Haley Baley and Melissa McCarthy, and even Javier Bardem, but I didn't enjoy the way the story was told.

Too many unnecessary changes have been made to the story, the new songs were more annoying than inspiring, and even the classic songs have been changed. Moments that were romantic in the cartoon seemed cheesy in the live action version.

Flounder and Sebastian were a let down as well, why did they look so boring?

The cgi was nice, but very dark in many scenes. After seeing Avatar 2, I wasn't impressed by it.

Ultimately I didn't feel the magic I have felt when I watched the cartoon for the first time, and sometimes it felt like it was made for TV and not the big screen.

At the end of the day it wasn't a bad movie, but compared to the original, it was a letdown."
"just admit it... this blows other remakes out the waterThis is one of the best live action remakes, hands down. The cast was incredible and the underwater, vibrant vfx were amazing!! Watch this in a dolby theater if you can!

The premise of the little mermaid is a simple one, and if you watch disney's 1989 animated version today, you'll see that they leaned really reallyyyy heavily into fairytale tropes... the most obvious one being they myth that a fleeting, superficial attraction = true love.

I loved this 2023 remake of the little mermaid bc it strengthens this central theme of the story. Ariel doesn't fall in love w eric bc he's a hot prince. This film makes a point to develop eric's character, to present eric and ariel as complex characters: two young, brave people on the precipice of life w helicopter parents who keep thwarting their plans for adventure. Every character in this film is very well developed, even their parents.

Some of y'all just hate live action remakes, and you should just say that. We get it, animation is fun... you miss seeing magical animals w big disney eyes-it's what makes these fairytale/kids movies instant classics. But live action gives actors, animators, AND visual effects artists the range to reimagine iconic films for a new audience. I'm not a huge ""live action remake"" fan, but this one blows every other out out the water- PUN INTENDED :)"
"Disney Gets One RightThe CGI is amazing throughout the film. Underwater scenes are bright and exciting, as is the shipwreck.

The acting is fairly good especially.the young lady who plays the mermaid. Javier Bardem is always a pleasure. McCarthy is her usual over the top. The only clunker is the male lead who is bland.

Overall, it was a nice way to spend a little more than two hours at the movies. This is coming from someone who had held most of the live action Disney remakes as useless. This one seemed to hit all the right notes and tugs at the heartstrings at times. Why not give it a try? I can think of worse ways to while away your time."

"We thoroughly enjoyed thisWe saw it tonight and we ( daughters and granddaughters ) loved it !! It was exciting, beautiful, entertaining, romantic...the actors were wonderful and the singing voices were thrilling! We saw the original Disney version in 1989 and this one was also awesome but in a different way. The characters of Ariel and Eric were lovable. Ursula as played by Melissa McCarthy was powerful! The colors , the under the sea action and music swept me away. I can't understand why anyone would say they were "" bored "" by this film.( it was one of the comments here) My granddaughters were pleased. I would say that there were some frightening scenes but it didn't bother them! Bravo !"
"Pretty good, but not a patch on the original.Mermaid Ariel wishes to swap her tail for legs, she does a deal with Ursula, but the price is a high one.

So, it's another cartoon given the treatment, and it's fair to say that The Little Mermaid has been much publicised, and fairly well anticipated.

I'm not generally a big fan of the love action movies, generally I favour the cartoons, some have been ok, some have been disastrous. The Little Mermaid, for my money is one of the better ones.

You get a vibe at The Cinema of how a movie has been received, the house was packed, and I would generally say this film was well received, personally I enjoyed it, I thought Halle Bailey was lovely in the role of Ariel, her voice was angelic.

The CGI, some of it was good, some of tilt looked pretty average at best, Flounder...I wasn't a fan.

Melissa McCarthy was, she was outrageously camp and clearly put a lot of vigour and kitsch humour into the part, she looked the part, you know what you're getting with McCarthy, but I thought she did a decent job.

Uplifting and fun, nothing too serious, I personally still think the animation is superior, but this was better than I had expected.

6/10."
"Bad acting, Bad CGI, Dull visuals, ugly songs.Disney live action remakes tend to be pretty bland and soulless, and this might be the worst one, CGI: The cgi looked really bad in some places, Ariel's face looked like it was floating in some places, reminded me of the live Action CATS movie, the hair looked really bad. The swimming scenes looked terrible in some places. Sometimes the actors didn't match to the cgi.

Acting: sometimes it was really awful. People felt like they were reading lines from a script without having real emotions, Ariel did not feel genuine. It felt like really bad overacting, it wasn't great.

Visuals: sometimes things looked too dull and dark, why do these Disney movies look like that? Dull colors in the sets and costumes. Why does disney do this?

They drain the color out of the visuals and everything looks dull. They wanted to make the movie realistic looking but they end up making it ugly looking. What's the point of cgi if everything looks dull.

The new songs were terrible. Really bad."
"Love is built on passion and chemistry, the heart and soul of this movie!The little mermaid live-action remake review: It's a beautiful movie but not a perfect adaptation.

But that's not necessarily a bad thing, it use's it's own creative ways to set this movie differently from the original. Don't think about this one as a adaptation but rather as a standalone Disney picture!

The better parts were above sea and not under the sea as Sebastian implies... The scene transitions were so clean and well done in a lot of ways, a visual pleasure.

I'm still from the point of view that Disney films should be short and powerful and not long and dragged out.

Love is built on passion and chemistry, the heart and soul of this movie!"
"FINALLY, A DECENT DISNEY LIVE-ACTIONI have never been eager to watch another Disney live-action remake - like ever. While a couple of them were actually good like Christopher Robin and Aladdin to name a few, majority of them were mostly mediocre to downright abysmal.

And now Disney brought us another re-adaptation of my most favorite film they have ever done.

Now, as a fan of Disney Renaissance's The Little Mermaid, what would I say about the latest addition to the live-action remakes? Well, I actually like it - it's surprisingly good. And here's why:

Halle Bailey is absolutely great as Ariel. I can definitely feel her whenever she is singing her heart out such as Part of Your World. Not to mention that she is the best part of the film.

Melissa McCarthy did not disappoint at all as Ursula Yeah, she still has that McCarthy behavior from her previous films but she managed to stick with her character and make her great portrayal of the villain.

As for Jonah Hauer King as Prince Eric, he works for the most part in the film. And compared to his animated counterpart, he has more personality by showing his voyager skills and love for adventure also thanks to the addition of having a mother for Eric.

Also, I loved the fact that unlike in the original classic, the film actually fleshed out his character a lot to make the relationship between Ariel and Eric. And while the relationship seemed somewhat hard to accept since it's only three days, at least it was explored more which made me feel for them.

Not gonna lie but Javier Bardem as King Triton makes more sense. While he may seem bland at times, his relationship with his daughter Ariel was expounded a lot more especially by the final act of the film.

As for the new songs, some worked with me like Hauer-King's Wild Uncharted Waters while others I am still warming up to like with Awkwafina and Daveed Diggs rap song The Scuttlebutt. The original songs sung by the cast were all good, no further explanations.

The setting was amazing for both the land and the sea, most especially for the latter that brings out great visuals like the Way of Water vibes. I really did experience both sides of the spectrum and how the film expounded on understanding the good in others despite their differences and history.

Thank goodness it is not a shot-to-shot remake like The Lion King. While the film relies on the nostalgia beats from the original, though it feels stretched out at times, it added more personality to Ariel and Eric alongside Ursula to shine more.

My only issues with the film apart from the realistic look of the animal characters Scuttle, Sebastian and Flounder, to which I got over with it, there were sequences that transitioned fast.

Overall, The Little Mermaid is, without a doubt, a good live-action adaptation of the Disney classics. Hopefully this is a start for the studio to be serious whenever it decides to adapt another film but making its own identity. Could it have been better? Of course. But nevertheless, it's still an enjoyable underwater adventure.

7.5/10 - Good."
"A shipwreck of a movieEven if you go in with low expectations you will still be disappointed by this shipwreck. From the flat acting to some flat singing, they is little to praise in this movie. It makes me dread how next years Snow White will turn out. What's next in the live action crosshairs remake? Since Disney still have a big catalog of classics still to mine it's anyone's guess.

Back to the film. Not just the leads but the whole cast have no chemistry with each other. I couldn't engage with the film on almost every level. The best part of the film is the new version of Under The Sea, that is until Ariel joins in. I'd recommend you watch the original and forget about watching this poor remake."
"An Unnecessary Inferior RemakeI think people who are not familiar and in love with the original will think it's fine but otherwise it's just another inferior remake.

While I will say I think Halle Bailey does a decent job, the rest of the cast is horrible. Melissa McCarthy makes Ursula downright boring and everyone cast to play Ariel's friends are just downright cringe. I'm normally a big fan of Daveed Diggs but he was absolutely wrong for Sebastian. Every time he was on screen was just annoying.

It unnecessarily long and boring, it's dark and at times hard to see, changes to the story and added characters contribute nothing (I found Queen Selena to be particularly irritating and unlikeable) the CGI is as bad as it looks in the trailers, and the costumes are just a mess. The remakes of the songs made my ears bleed (excluding the ones Halle sings).

All and all I'd say it's forgettable and will not stand the test of time like the original does.

Also, the song Scuttlebutt is the worst thing to happen in cinematic history. Just absolutely dreadful."
"Ariel has finally become a Disney iconAfter 34 years since the cartoon. I remember watching the original movie on vhs so many times as kid . I loved the songs and the characters. But Ariel was one of the best mermaid ever . Jodie who voiced Ariel 34 years ago made a remarkable comeback playing a shop keeper in the live action mermaid . Halle was so awesome. Her voice just blew me away . Her acting was very outstanding. Javier as triton was absolutely brilliant. His character was more protective of Ariel like the original movie. Eric was more adventurous. He wanted to see the world but his mother wouldn't. Eric's mother was new to the story and I found that very good. Akwafina and Diego and Jacob were brilliant voicing scuttle , Sebastian, and flounder . Melissa as Ursula was absolutely remarkable. She really played Ursula so well and her singing was no different than pat carrol . I'm very proud of the cast for playing the original characters from the 1989 cartoon."
"It's another live action remake of a Disney animated classic that feels like a waste of time.I went into this movie not thinking anything of it but hoping I would like it due to the controversy of Halle Bailey playing Ariel, but through no fault of Bailey the film is very lackluster.

Visually stunning, those underwater sequences made the movie beautiful despite how hallow it made the image. It did not look like they were acting behind a green screen it just felt like it. Made the performances feel wooden.

Ironically this might have a lot to do with them coping and pasting the animated movie to make these scenes. The 1989 animated feature was a part of Disney making that animated movie comeback, so the Little Mermaid was not of the same quality as Beauty the Beast or the Lion King.

When it came to the character design of the Disney Princesss' pet friends, I did not like this at all. It looked strange and out of place. All except scuttle. The bird had the voice of Awkafina coming out of her beak and she nailed it. Not as good as Ellen DeGeneres as Dora in Finding Nemo but only because she was not as much centered in attention. Nora from Queens even got a song written by Lin-Manuel Miranda (I believe because his name was on the credits for writing all new material and scuttle's song counts as that)

Another excellent performance was by Melissa McCarthy as Ursula. It paid homage to the character in the animated series and had just enough McCarthy tang to it. A very good villain indeed.

I'm gonna have to say that Aladdin is the best live-action adaption of an animated movie Disney did so far. It may not have been a money maker in comparisons to the Lion King remake but with Aladdin, what they brought to the table did not make the movie a waste of space. The Small changes they maid to the live action version of the Little Mermaid just makes me think they could have used the money to make anything else."
"Somewhere they walk Somewhere they run Somewhere they stay all day in the sun Wandering free Wish I could be away from this Disney Filled WorldThere's not a lot to go over in this review as the idea itself is as you will have either seen and understood or guessed as it's Disney and another remake of a classic piece of their Renaissance. I won't be going into details on the plot IMDB so the spoiler tag isn't on, no point as what could be spoiled isn't worth it.

The feeling of utter and complete emptiness that fills a person when you see a piece of media trampled on by a modern retelling of it because the ideas of the modern era say being forthright, determined, strong and stable towards the goals you set yourself are bad things because those things include the idea of wanting to devote your life to the pursuit of something that is amazing and very different from where and how you're born is something that disturbs me.

Because that's what this movie teaches little girls, it doesn't speak to love, to devotion to happiness, to joy of finding another person to spend your life with. It speaks to the same message that has been paraded out for the last 20 or so years that has solidified a collection of people into being what we see today as something bad.

I used the lyrics of the song Part of your world for the title of this for a reason, as Ariel's ideals are to seek out the Human world because it's interesting, different and totally opposite to the way her world is, and her telling of just how amazing the Human World is and wants to experience everything in it is lost in this rendition as there's no previous impetus for her to be interested in it.

It rings as hollow as every other remake Disney has made and will continue to be made because there's nothing sacred anymore, not with them.

I usually have either joy or snark with these but for this...this hurts more than anything else has as it was this movie that started Disney back on their winning streak that lasted over a decade and made some of the best animated movies of all time. Watch any of them and you see the artistry at work at such jaw-droppingly stunning scenes that were - by and large - not done with computers but by hand.

This though, it's ultimately soulless and lacking in every single thing that makes it worthwhile."
"A Classic Reborn and brought to the surfaceThe new, live-action ""The Little Mermaid"" is a movie that reeks of obligation and noble intentions. It lacks joy, fun, mystery, risk, flavor, and kink. The movie is saying, ""We tried!"" to not offend, appall, challenge, or imagine. A crab croons, a gull raps, and a sea witch swells to Stay Puft proportions, but it feels made in anticipation of being taken too seriously. The script, credited to David Magee, John DeLuca, and the director Rob Marshall, informs us that the queen has adopted the prince (because somebody knew inquiring minds would need to know). As the bosomy, tentacled Ursula, who's now Triton's banished, embittered sister, Melissa McCarthy puts a little pathos in the part's malignancy. She seems like she's having a fine time, a little Bette Midler, a little Mae West, a little Etta James. And the sight of her racing toward the camera in a slithery gush of arms and fury is the movie's one good nightmare image. But even McCarthy seems stuck in a shot-for-shot, growl-for-growl tribute to her cartoon counterpart and Pat Carroll's vocal immortalization of it. The script, credited to David Magee, John DeLuca, and Rob Marshall, informs us that the queen has adopted the prince. Melissa McCarthy plays Ursula, who is now Triton's banished, embittered sister.

However, McCarthy seems stuck in a tribute to her cartoon counterpart and Pat Carroll's vocal immortalization of it. Halle Bailey is radiant in the title role of ""Part of Your World"". She is expressive, energetic and likable, with a mixture of girlish sweetness and womanly spine. Her rendition of ""Part of Your World"" is unexpectedly stirring, and she deserves to be a major star. She is up for everything this role demands of her, both physically and emotionally, and deserves to be a major star. The visual effects in ""The Little Mermaid"" are the film's main weakness. Marshall was nominated for an Academy Award for ""Chicago,"" but the underwater motion often looks flat and artificial. The production number is bursting with vibrant colors and the sea creatures' elaborate choreography is a delight, but it doesn't capture the feeling of being under the sea. Flounder, voiced by Jacob Tremblay, makes an awkward fit within the live-action setting, especially above the water's surface. The fictional Caribbean island where ""The Little Mermaid"" takes place is a pleasant escape from Pandora."
"Wow!!! A sea star is bornThe Little Mermaid is an Amazing film, honestly. The kids loved it and truly its a great adaptation of the original. I grew up on the classic so i know what to expect and not expect in a live action version. I was pleasently suprised by the cast. Sebastien, scuttle and ariel where perfect, eric was charming. Highly recommend. One thing i wish was added was more was another carribean high beat song like under the sea, but the ones we got where great.

My theatre loved daveed and awkwafina because of their comedy. The theatre clapped at the end which doesnt happen alot. I really think once those who where skeptical sees the film theyll actually find themselves tapping their feet, crying and cheering along. All in all, its a film that not only a child will enjoy but adults too. Facts."
"CGI HairI watched and loved the original animation a lot when I was a kid. It was fun to watch this movie in the cinema. Did i like it? I don't know. I thought it was an average movie. Was it necessary? No ! But I was not bored while watching it. I enjoyed it. Acting wasn't bad. Unfortunately, I didn't know how the original songs sounded because I watched them with dubbing. I will listen later. CGI was ok. There were also scenes that were not good. Javier Bardem was a little funny, I couldn't take it too seriously. Awkwafina I don't understand why they are casting this girl. She's not funny. Boring. Overall I think it's an ok movie. It was fun to watch in the cinema."
"Absolute SnoozerI regret taking my grandkids to see this. Two of them fell asleep and got a $15 a head nap. This will go down as one of the best examples of why you should NEVER do a remake. The acting was dull, the colors were dark, the characters were annoying. I will never get the sound of that horrid ""Scuttlebutt"" song out of my head. I think I found my new alarm to motivate me to get up and shut it off. I guess they spent their entire CGI budget on making Ariel's hair appear straight and flowy because I figured that you'd get better effects after spending 1/3 of a billion dollars on a movie. My advice is that if you want to see a movie about a royal family that involves water and quirky creatures that you go see Avatar The Way of Water."
"Just Keep Swimming (and Singing)I went into this movie with low expectations, mostly due to the disappointing recent Disney live-action remakes. Halle Bailey and the rest of ""The Little Mermaid"" production won me over and I left the theater a fan. The casting was excellent, with Melissa McCarthy's Ursula and Jonah Hauer-King's Prince Eric standing out (on top of Halle Bailey's awe-inspiring voice).

Not only were the performances strong, but the screenwriter added depth to the story. From Ursula's backstory to the relationship between Ariel and Eric, the added scenes were excellently placed. The film stayed true to the source material while also elevating it in the process.

Late last year, ""Avatar: The Way of Water"" completely changed the game for underwater cinematography. Unfortunately, this film's underwater moments did not meet the same high bar. Similarly, though most of the cast was stellar, I had a hard time stomaching the performances of Javier Bardem (King Triton) and Awkwafina (Scuttle).

One of the selling points of this movie was the addition of three new songs from Lin Manuel Miranda (""Hamilton"" and ""Encanto""). While I am usually a fan of his work, these new songs were not anything special. One of the songs, ""The Scuttlebutt"" is particularly awful, though the teenagers in my theater seemed to enjoy it.

Of the 17 Disney remakes since 2010, this is one of the strongest. Ariel's voice is the best of any of the live-action princesses, and the story stayed true to the original while adding interesting depth. There are multiple ""chill-worthy"" moments, including an incredible rendition of ""Kiss the Girl"".

Note: I said that I didn't like the new songs, but ""Wild Uncharted Waters"" gets better each time I listen to it.

Best Character: Eric.

Best Quote: ""Don't be held back by what you think should be. Think of only what is."" - Grimsby.

Best Scene: Kiss the Girl.

Best Song: ""Wild Uncharted Waters"".

"Give it a go!Well I must start by saying that I'm a huge The Little Mermaid fan. I've watched the VHS hundreds of times when I was a kid. So I made an effort to go watch this in theaters last night with an open mind. I was a bit sad at the beginning because we do not get the chance to explore the merpeople's kingdom. There was no golden castle at the bottom of the ocean. Rocks, caves, and a few seconds of mermaids dancing and going about their lives was all we've got. I was a bit disappointed to realize that THAT was the introduction to a movie that ended up to be super sweet and immersive. All characters were on point, however king Triton could have been played by anyone else. I was not mesmerized by Melissa Mcarthy's performance, I thought it was ok. Now, Halle Bailey and Jonah both were perfectly casted for this film. I'm truly proud of both for pulling this out so well. The movie pays respect to the original and the new additions were much needed. However, two of the three songs I didn't care for: wild uncharted waters and scuttlebutt. One felt too long and the other was an out of the blue rap sung by Awkwafina and Daveed Digs. The only thing that annoyed the hell out of me was the last two minutes of this film. As we all know, King Triton comes to the surface to say goodbye to Ariel and, oh my god, I kid you not, the water on his waist was poorly executed. I don't understand how could Disney approve the visuals for this crucial moment of the story. At its core The Little Mermaid is about the love between father and daughter, and learning how to let go. How could the CGI be more than acceptable throughout the entire movie and then, in this iconic scene, was completely discarded? King Triton also looks at Ariel for 5 seconds too long, with absolutely no expression on his face besides 'I'm so cold out here, please someone yell CUT'. The final words between both father and daughter were there, and it was very emotional, but those little details messed it up for me at the end. Unfortunately I left the theater thinking 'oh, so close'. But again, it was a very important scene to me, maybe it won't bother you. Give it a chance and have fun! I certainly did."
"Below expectation, even for kidsWhat we expected from this live action remake was a spectacle.afloat with.new ideas and genuine and attractive scenes that.could take you to an adventurous journey and to open new windows to discovering a sensible way of life. The cliché idea to look beyond a fishbowl is so old and repeated in bed time stories and children's films.while lacking any special attractive features makes this film a boring class of senseless or at best repetitive notions that does not satisfy neither adolescents nor children, not to say enriching their cultural background . Adding to the above is.below average casting and insipid characters struggling to create a climax that could not ramp up.

If you wait for a TV showing sometimes later you could bear it while checking you mobile or doing housework. Though, even for a long weekend it is not worth paying ticket price. Keep the money in your pocket and find a better way of spending it at this time of high inflation and high interest rates."
"Another Disney failureDisney is on a roll of putting out movies that make me want to stop watching Disney movies. This is a live action adaption of a highly successful and liveable animated movie. Other than the musical parts being well done, the movie is a flop. The casting just doesn't work (including voice actors). The acting is surprisingly sub par throughout most of the movie. The star, Halle Barry, has a wonderful voice, but her acting in this adaption simply falls flat. It is bad enough that Disney has made some absolutely horrible Star Wars series, but they are now ruining some absolutely classic favorites."
"Better than expectedWas so lucky to have actually seen it two days before it comes out via an AMC Theatres Early Access Screening in 3D! The main reason to see it is Halle Bailey and her amazing performance as Ariel. She nailed all the aspects the role required, same because Melissa McCarthy was the right pick for Ursula. Alan Menken did it once again with the iconic score and the specifically little new touches to the story to expand on Ariel and Eric's relationship earns an extra point, making us really be a ""part of their world."" The visuals look better when seen in 3D, and it looked much, much more ""technicolorful"" than the trailers. Definitely go and see it! And don't listen to the review bombers (that madness needs to stop and I mean it). Go in with an open mind."

"Am I the weird one for not liking this?I mean it's an okay film. But is that what Disney wants to achieve now? Just to make okay movies? What happened to making great and lasting ones? Is that just a thing of the past?

My biggest qualm with this movie is that the acting performances from the cast was lackluster. These Disney classics are sacred in a sense that they made us emotionally invested in them. It's disappointing to think that animated characters were able to ""act"" and exhibit more emotional pull more than live actors. The original made us feel for these characters.

This version had no heart in it, it's just the shell of the 1989 classic with an attempt to impress contemporary audiences but it still fell flat on its face.

The scenes in this movie felt rushed and it was just hard to watch all together without thinking they just had a checklist of events they wanted to make sure was there. The dialogue was sub-par. The new rap song was simply unbearable. I had my hands over my ears while it was happening.

The only thing I could compliment about this movie are the visual effects. I liked the feel of the setting. But other than that. It felt more two dimensional than the cartoon."
Loved itDecided to go see this with my wife was not a disappointment whatsoever. This movie is much above and beyond what I anticipated. Hallie rocked her role a Ariel she was born for this role. Cinematography in this movie was beyond what I expected. Simply a beautiful movie lead with an amazing cast loved Melissa McCarthy's role in this movie. Hallie and Melissa truly excellent work. They both deserve awards for this role. I went into this movie with no expectations and glad I did because it was beyond what I would've anticipated it to be. I hope Disney does more of their movies like this one best live action movie I've seen since the lion King.
"Charming remakeLike most Disney live action remakes, The Little Mermaid is way longer than the original despite the same overall plot and is overly grey thanks to pointless 'realism' but it remains a charming remake thanks to a well chosen cast and new ideas and elements that work more than they miss.

Halle Bailey is incredible as Ariel, full of joy and wonder which is still clearly present once she loses her voice and obviously can really sing. She also has an endearing chemistry with Jonah Hauer-King, who makes for a better Prince Eric than in the original with more depth and humanity to his character.

Daveed Diggs is a great Sebastian, remaining really funny whilst making the role his own. Melissa McCarthy is terrific thanks to how clearly she's enjoying being this evil. Javier Bardem disappointingly phones it in, bringing none of the boisterous energy that Triton had in the original.

Rob Marshall's direction is fine overall, it never looks like anyone is underwater (even in comparison to something like Aquaman let alone Avatar) but it's much better when above sea level. The original songs remain a lot of fun but the new ones are hit and miss. Some work, some don't but they're all noticeably different to the classics."
"Disney reaches a new lowWith The Little Mermaid, Disney achieves the rare feat of making a live action movie seem less real than the animated version. The entire film is an embarrassment. In its best moments, it feels like a broadway show (probably its intent). In its worst moments, and for the majority of the film, it feels like a cheap SeaWorld show.

The actors do their best given the cards they were dealt, but none is actually given a chance to shine. Points to Halle Bailey for trying hard, but this is not the role that will make her shine - how could it?, and she finds herself trying to add fake intensity in the absence of any other option to do something with her character. One can only hope that she will soon be given a real role, because every so often in the film, you can glean some talent crying to be given a chance. Melissa McCarthy fails as Ursula, turning one of the best Disney villains into one of the most irrelevant characters in a movie in a long time. Javier Bardem tries to pull a more subtle acting style, but it contrasts with the style of the movie, creating dissonance and ultimately making him look uninterested - can't really blame him.

I usually don't care about special effects much, but in this case, they really underwhelm, giving the audience the unavoidable feeling that they will feel really dated in just a few years, and adding to the feeling of cheap SeaWorld show that permeates the movie.

Beyond that, the movie follows the usual Disney live action playbook, replicating every last line and every last shot of the original, with a couple silly additions. As a member of the audience, you find yourself playing ""seven differences"" with the original, for lack of anything better to do. In this case, the differences are not hard to find, and let it just be said that none is memorable, which is a low bar for a film that swims in such depths of low quality.

Overall, my vote for Disney's worst live action remake to date (a pretty low bar considering the competition)."
"Super Beautiful colours and don't believe the haters online!They have fixed the colours of the movie, and the haters all said things like Prince Eric had to ask permission for the kiss when it didn't happen, the sea creatures have emotions Disney did his best with the sea creatures, Sebastián's voice was really super funny, scuddle to, super voices too, definitely a must to watch, good actors! Halle did a great job! And so did the prince en the rest! The colors are not like in the trailer, they improved the colors, Ursula did a great job wow really great, the editing work was also beautiful, the old and new songs were really beautiful, this is a must to watch with friends family , and all the sisters looked beautiful, all their own colors wow beautiful."
"A watchable live-action adaptation from Disney.The Little Mermaid tells the fairy tale of Ariel, a mermaid who has an unusual soft corner for humans and enormous curiosity to know the world above despite her father's warnings. A shipwrecking incident leads to her saving Prince Eric from drowning and falling in love with him, a human. The evil Sea witch Ursula uses this as an opportunity to trick Ariel into becoming human, Ariel's voice for legs kind of deal. Also involves one true love's kiss to make Ariel's wish come true. How Ariel stops Ursula and eventually gets to live the life she dreams off forms the story.

It is once again the songs that stand out and firmly aided by the performances especially by Melissa McCarthy as Ursula and Halle Bailey as Ariel. Visually the film is serviceable, although 3D was just a cash grab. The story still stands tall, justifying Disney milking it with the live action adaptation. With over 2 hours runtime, the narratively barely becomes boring as the film largely remains to be captivating."
"Original was betterJust wasn't impressed with the remake. My daughter who's 12 even said the original was way better, and it don't take much to see why. I just don't see the need to remake what was a great movie, unless Disney I'd just trying to cash in. The characters in CGI were no where near as good as the cartoon. I wasn't impressed at the new Ariel and just didn't come off the way I expected a talented actor like berry is. I was impressed with the singing, but that's about it. Like I said in the headline, I don't think a remake was warranted. As a Disney fan of all the older movies I grew up with, this does the original bad."
"Target audience is all over the placeSpent tickets on this and excluding Halle Bailey, it's just a constant devoid of soul, sure the cast is well acted & performed & I did appreciate the new additions how it wasn't a scene from scene remake. But the best parts of this movie is everything that it borrows from the original. There's just 1 moment that it expands that feels good & that's the prince Eric song, and I did like how him & Ariel get more time. However you do feel the plot/story being prolonged in the process. It doesn't flow as good as it should. These are slight nit picks, but Haley Bailey is just amazing as Ariel, she has the voice & charm, her & Eric shine. With that aside a lot of other things are a let down. Melissa McCarthy had some good moments as Ursula but it's just another lacking depth version, her version of unfortunate souls was just lacking anything interesting, no dancing or wit either, in fact not only this but the musical parts of this movie felt completely bland. This version of Under the sea felt like a cheap drunk Karaoke commercial, the production does not mesh well either & looks occasionally ugly to look at. And I think that's where this film fails big time, I didn't believe Ariel was ""part of this world"" it felt half baked even in direction, is this A remake? A reimagining? Or a carbon copy? It felt so desperate at trying to appease the adults who grew up with the original making it more realistic, while also appeasing the kids, & also appeasing the modernization with some obvious & questionable changes. If you're going to change an icon like Ariel & race change her, that's fine, I love that & support that, but I feel there was a huge missed opportunity here, this film would have succeeded if it was a reimagining & focused on a darker tale, because the tone on this film is just all over the place, a darker & realistic approach would have been cool, maybe with a darker spin to these songs, times it felt that this movie wasted at copying the original was time it could have spent being unique & the creatures looking way too realistic didn't make me care for them one bit, rather than trying to be all these things at once it should have focused on being one or the other.

Someone needs to nail these remakes to a 4.5 / 10."
"I enjoyed this movie for the most part.Controversy aside Halle Bailey was perfect and well cast as Ariel. If nothing else it was important for Halle Bailey nail and embody the character/essence of Ariel and she did just that. With Halle's ethereal beauty ergo Disney princess face and her beautiful siren like voice she is destined for stardom.

The underwater scenes were beautiful and I enjoyed the musical numbers especially ""Under The Sea."" and of course ""Part of Your World"", well it is a musical after all.

This was the best animated to live action Disney movie so far. My 8 year old niece really loved this movie of course she is the target audience."
"Did Disney finally get it right?Disney's track record for live-action adaptations hasn't lived up to the expectations of the charm and nostalgia that their original stories provide, but The Little Mermaid defies those odds. Halle Bailey is perfectly cast, and whether or not her talent will expand into other major roles, this performance was as powerful as any classic Ariel fan could have wanted. The risk isn't as heavy as it could have been however the emotional connection between these characters fill in that void. Many other Disney adaptations lack the tonality that audiences have grown so attached to, but with an incredible score from Alan Menken and a bit of innovation from Lin-Manuel Miranda, the tone is parallel to the original film from 1989. An inspirational addition to the long line of well remembered Disney princess characters and hopefully a foundation for more to come."
"Souless remakeThe original 1989 movie was one of my favorites as a child although I enjoyed more Aladdin and the lion king.

The movie tries too hard to be what it is not, it would have worked way better as a new original story even if it was based on the same tale.

Halle Bailey doesn't do it bad as Ariel, her acting is ok and she has a great voice.

Eric is ok too as well as Bardem as Triton.

Ursula is bad, fails to make the character her own and just copies the original but badly.

The story is basically the same but stretched. Some scenes from the original are gone and some others are added. I think there are three new songs, the Halle Bailey one was good and original, the others quite meh.

The think that disgusted me the most was how out of tune the old songs were, and it's a shame because Halle has a great voice, but time and time again she was out of tune with the music. Ursula was plain awful with her singing, looked like it was a voice over and she was clueless on what was going on in the scene.

Been generous, the movie could have been a 6, but I have to take into account what came before."
"This is the best Disney live action remakeAriel Is Great, Ursula Is Better Than the live action jafar, I watched it this Wednesday (it was a early screening), and I got a poster for the movie, I was suprised by how Disney Is Really Coming Back To Good Disney Movies After The 2022 films: Strange world, turning red, and Lightyear (even tho I didn't see it), so I think that this movie has great cgi and great fantasy, I didn't watch the original movie, but now that next month we have a rival to the little mermaid that's mermaid related (Ruby gillman, teenage kraken) that's named Chelsea, I hope that Disney will be the best company that maked the better movies in 2023 than DreamWorks, etc because trolls: band together is gonna be the next trolls movie from dreamworks (really pissed me off), so a 9/10 movie for this movie."
"LovelyLovely. Everything the movie adds is tremendous and works really well, and the whole new world above the sea is fascinating. The aquatic world doesn't always hit the mark, and the final battle is a bit underwhelming. Nonetheless, it's a charming film and a journey I won't mind repeating very soon.

I loved all the musical numbers, and the actors are generally up to par (Bardem is surprisingly weak though). McCarthy is great in the role of Ursula. Jonah Hauer-King and Daveed Diggs (as Sebastian) are two pleasant surprises. But make no mistake: Halle Bailey is the star and she is mesmerizing as Ariel. With a powerful voice, she can lift anyone from their seat during the songs, but it's as an actress that she surprises the most. Her expressiveness is sensational and moves us even when she's voiceless. Lovely and warming performance."
"What am I watching?!What am I watching?!

1. The CGI is really terrible.

2. Ariel's outfit is modified in comparison to the animated version, no shells.

3. The red-hair doesn't look right in comparison to the animated version.

4. There is a lighting difference between the animation version and the live action version that does not appear to be connect, can not seem to put my finger on it.

5. The prince looks to young and don't mirror how the original animated version was delivered, no dog.

6. Additionally,the CGI for the seagulls and crab are shockingly bad.

7. The whole section for ""poor unfortunate souls"" in juxtaposition to the animated version is totally different.

Bottom line is this live action is hard to watch and doesn't keep the audience engaged."
"Shalala Kiss the girl!The movie is fantastic, a gorgeous fresh take on the beloved story of Ariel. Halle Bailey is gorgeous and radiant as Ariel , she is perfect , her voice is crystal clear . Jonah-Hauer king is brilliant as prince Eric ,I loved how they give him more character and oh he can sing , he is a fine prince . Just go watch it yourself. The new songs are good!

It's new it's fresh and beautiful, the movie is funny , sweet , fun. I won't recommend for really young children it's maybe a bit to scary for them at some points. In the Netherlands they rated it as for above 9 years and older.

But you know your child better then anyone else."
"Under the sea of outrageI do not care for all the outrage, it's just a movie that kids will watch while on their phones and occasionally look up at the screen while the adults argue about the casting decisions. I'm a huge fan of the original and I'll say this movie was one of Disney's better live-action films. It wasn't bad and all your favorite songs are there including some new ones. The live-action stays true to its counterpart, mirroring the original scene by scene. The acting was okay but what more do you want from a children's film. Melissa McCarthy as Ursula stole the show, she was fantastic. It's just a movie people, it will come and go and soon be forgotten."
"A Disastrous Dive into the AbyssThe new Little Mermaid movie is an absolute disaster that deserves nothing but scathing criticism. From start to finish, this cinematic trainwreck epitomizes everything wrong with modern filmmaking, leaving audiences questioning why they wasted their precious time and hard-earned money on such a shambles of a production.

Let's begin with the abysmal acting. The performances in this film can only be described as painful to watch. It's evident that the casting directors prioritized appearance over talent, resulting in a cast that lacks any semblance of charisma or ability. The lead actress, tasked with embodying the beloved character of Ariel, fails to capture her essence, delivering a lifeless portrayal that leaves audiences yearning for the animated version's vibrant personality.

But the atrocious acting is not the only problem plaguing this film. The screenplay itself is an insult to the original masterpiece. Instead of offering a fresh take on the beloved story, the writers opt for a disjointed narrative filled with unnecessary plot twists and cringe-worthy dialogue. The charm and depth of the original tale are nowhere to be found, replaced instead with shallow and hollow storytelling.

Even the visual effects, touted as a redeeming quality, are disappointingly lackluster. The underwater scenes are poorly executed, with glaringly obvious green screen effects that detract from any sense of immersion. It's as if the production team cared more about cutting corners than delivering a visually stunning experience worthy of the Little Mermaid's enchanting world.

Moreover, the film's direction is haphazard and misguided. The director fails to elicit any emotional connection from the audience, leaving pivotal moments feeling flat and devoid of impact. The pacing is all over the place, further exacerbating the overall disarray of the film.

In conclusion, the new Little Mermaid movie is an unmitigated disaster. Its appalling acting, poorly written screenplay, lackluster visual effects, and direction devoid of any artistic vision render it an insult to the original source material. Rather than paying homage to a beloved classic, this film tarnishes its legacy. Save yourself the agony and steer clear of this cinematic catastrophe."
"MehAnother Disney spectacle that falls short and will go down as a movie that will soon be forgotten! The movie is just another soulless remake and showcases Disney's inability to create something new and inspiring. Since Avatar 2 we know how beautiful underwater scenery can be, unfortunately the creators of Mermaid had no clue how to make it look as beautiful. The movie is way to long for the story and it gets boring quickly. The original is some 90 minutes long whereas this is 135! This movie lacks the charm of the original version and tries to hard to be something it's not....an unforgettable childhood memory!"

"Disney Earns a Failed Grade, Not The MovieThe Little Mermaid (1989) holds a special place in my heart due to its harmonious singing and the lively presence of sea creatures in the film. However, I am disappointed with the new film as it lacks the charm and liveliness of the original. The removal of Ursula's lines and the silence of her eels, as well as Ariel singing without her voice, threw me off. Although Halle Bailey's performance was great. Especially Jessica Alexander's short screen time, she was a phenomenal actress. Flounder lost his charm. I could hear him doing great with the voice, however the facial expressions were not matching his voice expression. Scuttle by Awkwafina's rap was atrocious. Above all else, I believe that Disney's liberal mindset ruined the movie for me."
"Surprisingly not bad.I wasn't a fan of the original, but decided to give this look, and I was very entertained. The musical numbers are okay, but I think if they didn't have it, it still would be a good movie.

The cast play there parts very well. Halle Bailey really shows Ariels innocence and curiousness of the human world. Melissa McCarthy really steals the show has Ursula. Effects in the underwater parts of the movie, are perfectly well done, a little bit better than Aquaman, the rest of the cast are pretty good like Javier Bardon has the seas king. Scenes on land are also good. The film is an enjoyable watch for the whole family."
"The Little MermaidHappily, The movie flaws aren't enough to sink the film. Bailey's Ariel is radiant throughout and, in places, Marshall's hyper-stylized visuals add oomph and dazzle to the songs.

Halle Bailey was born to play Ariel! Her ""Part Of Your World"" is a true revelation. I love the new additions to the story that let her and Eric form a real connection. They were able to add suspense to a classic story we all know and love.

Although money was undoubtedly the primary driver for remaking The Little Mermaid, at least on this occasion the filmmakers have proven able to engage in something more than nostalgia-mining."
"The kids will be alrightSlow and dreary for the most part compared to the original, however Halle Bailey is clearly the bright spot of the film from her voice to her charisma, despite how far a departure she is from the written character. Javier Bardem looks completely sedated, Melissa McCarthy is doing the same boring schtick, the underwater sequences are far too dark and murky. The only things saving it from being a complete bomb are the musical numbers and charisma from Bailey, and Daveed Diggs dialog and musical numbers as Sebastian.

Flounder is the stuff of nightmares and Awkwafina as Scuttle is ear torture...

The prince and rest of the supporting cast are completely forgettable.

The kids might like it, but it's better to stick with the original. It's just not good, but it's not bad enough to be legendarily horrible. It's on par with any other movie that keeps your eyes glued to your watch whilst repeatedly rolling your eyes.

3/10."
"This is my ArielThis movie was simply amazing! Halle Bailey did a wonderful job! Halle be very proud of yourself! You looked happy and obviously enjoying yourself making this movie. This should have been the original-not the ""flat"" boring animated one. In all of my 58 years on this earth, I will never understand how this movie made such a controversy. My lord get a life! The story is built on the same premise. The actress is a real person, not a fictional character-why compare? If someone truly did not like the movie, that's fine, but I wish some people would at least be honest about the real reason they didn't like it. Example: I read comments where people said the movie was too long, and their kids became bored, okay stop lying! You knew the movie was long before you purchased your tickets, ma'am/sir. Also, some stated, it had no soul-It was full of life. I don't care if you disagree with my review and you vote it's ""not helpful"". Again I have a life, and don't lose sleep at night over what color a fictional character should be. Great job Halle!"

A total skip of this movie!!!Disney really needs more original stories... and quit turning animated movies to live action. What a waste of energy and funds! It's really not about race.... the performances were well done from everybody it's really just a tepid movie. Melissa Mccarthy bless her heart for trying. Daveen incredibly done.... it's just a lukewarm movie... that's all .... no matter if you added new original songs... it's just adding lipstick to a pig!!! It's not good and it's not that bad either. It's v the essence of mediocrity at its very very finest. I really coddle skipped over Awkafina as Skuttles...poor Buddy Hackett he must be rolling over his grave!!! So final message..Disney get a freaking original clue!
"Longing to Escape: Somewhere Beyond this Disney-Filled WorldThis review won't be a long one because the movie I'm talking about is probably something you're already familiar with. It's another Disney remake of a classic from their Renaissance era. I won't delve into the plot details or spoil anything because, to be honest, there's not much worth spoiling.

Have you ever felt that sense of disappointment when a modern retelling of a beloved story fails to capture its essence? That's how I felt watching this movie. It seems like nowadays, the idea of being determined, strong, and pursuing your dreams is seen as a bad thing. It's as if we're discouraged from dedicating our lives to something amazing and different from our origins.

And that's the message this movie sends to little girls. It doesn't focus on love, devotion, happiness, or finding a lifelong partner. Instead, it perpetuates the notion that these qualities are somehow negative. It's a recurring theme that has been promoted for the past couple of decades, leading to the negative state of affairs we see today.

I deliberately titled this review with a reference to the song ""Part of Your World"" because Ariel's longing to explore the human world, with all its fascinating differences, is a central part of her character. However, this rendition fails to establish a compelling reason for her interest in the human world. The movie lacks the depth and meaning of the original.

Just like the other Disney remakes, this one feels empty and devoid of any real significance. It seems that nothing is sacred anymore to Disney. This hurts me more than anything else because this movie was the catalyst for Disney's remarkable winning streak, which lasted over a decade and gave us some of the greatest animated films of all time. If you watch any of those classics, you'll witness the breathtaking artistry and handcrafted beauty that went into their creation.

But this remake falls flat. It lacks soul and fails to capture the essence of what made the original so worthwhile."
"Excellent!I saw the animated film more than decades ago or so and have an idea of what the film will be all about, or I guess need to refresh as well. As expected, we hear the classic sounds and characters, and once again reminiscing our childhood days and for the new batch of children and children at heart, this will surely one's for you! I love the visual effects, extremely cool, the new batch of artists were superb! I suggest you go to a premium theater to make more all worth it! From start to finish, your eyes will be glued as it's so cool and warm to watch. I never expecting that it's a tear jerker film, perfect for Father's Day movie and again, everyone will love it! Can't wait to have this on my blu ray collections..."
"Perfectly fine but fails to excite in any wayI've never seen the original The Little Mermaid so I entered this film with no cynicism or prejudice (which a lot of reviewers seem to be doing!) as I have nothing to compare it to. With this in mind I'd say I was just about satisfied with this film.

Most of the enjoyment comes from the stellar lead performance from Halle Bailey. She instantly captures your attention and brings a great sense of magic and wonder to her performance. Her voice is incredible and my only complaint would be that we didn't get enough of it! The other cast members were all very appealing too.

The underwater elements are very well executed, which isn't always a given with these sorts of films. The effects on things like hair and the mermaid tails were all very solid. In fact the CGI in general was all quite positive.

My main issue really is with the story. It just feels quite bland and so unnecessarily dragged out. It has no right being over two hours long. The characters and themes are not explored enough to warrant that at all. None of the relationships feel real or authentic. It all just falls a little flat from this perspective.

Too many of the characters are on the periphery when they should have much bigger roles. Melissa McCarthy gives a decent performance but Ursula is an underwhelming 'villain' with her arc over far too quickly. Javier Bardem seems wasted in a pretty small role. The human characters don't really get much development.

Ultimately there's just nothing to grab onto in this film and connect to. With the runtime, the budget and the big names involved there was much more potential here.

I'm just left a little baffled as to who this film is for. The runtime is a little too unforgiving for children and the story too ploddy, and the plot and characters are too vapid for an adult to really enjoy. It's a perfectly fine watch but if they'd have taken a few more risks with the story it could have been much better."

"Wasn't sure what to expect...But I loved it! Hallie Bailey is brilliant as Ariel, with an incredible voice. I loved the look of the mer people and the world they inhabited too. As for Sebastian and Flounder, I was expecting to be disappointed, but I liked their photo realism and their humour. Melissa McCarthy was great as Ursula too- though I would have liked a bit more interaction with her and Triton to flesh out their history. The music was fantastic- the renditions of Part of Your World are perfect. My only question with the songs were the inclusion of Scuttlebuts' song. It was an ok song, but I'm not sure it fit in with the story and was a bit out of place. Other than that I thought it was a brilliant stroke making the music with a Caribbean flavour!"
"Better than i expectedTo be fair i only went to see it because i have two granddaughters, 8 & 6. But I'm glad i did, i thought it was reasonably true enough to the cartoon version my kids watched 5000 times 25 years ago. There's some changes, my adult daughter was more unhappy about those than any of the rest of us😂 i liked this version of Prince Eric more than i did the cartoon version. The young lady who played Ariel did a great job and her voice is divine. Was a surprise to see Javier Bardem in it, but he played his part well. In my opinion, Melissa McCarthy stole the show though! Her Ursula was great fun and who knew she could sing?"

"A triumph-best live action yetI'm a 33 year old woman who grew up watching the little mermaid. It was one of my favorite movies and remains so. I've been eagerly anticipating this movie since they announced they were making it five years ago. I've been scared and excited. Disney live action remakes are usually mediocre and leave me feeling disappointed and my expectations let down.

The little mermaid surpassed my hopes and expectations-which were quite high and had been building for years. I can be quite critical and always have a very specific vision in my head of what I want to see. I walked out of the theater with no critiques or complaints. The story, dialogue, music, casting-it's all incredible. Halle Bailey IS Ariel. My soul is happy. I honestly think that most people will love this movie."
"OVERALL SUPER SATISFIED🌟After watching the trailer, my expectation's weren't all that high. I just didn't think it looked promising. But in the theater I was sooo happy with it. I thought the visuals were beautiful and I loved all the actors. Halle Bailey was a perfect Ariel. Super charismatic and charming. She and Jonah Hauer-King did a very good job. Except the chemistry. I didn't really feel the attraction between them, and the kiss at the end. Come on! That was what it was all about. There just wasn't that spark. But Sebastian and the bird (can't remember) were funny and the underwater scenes worked really well. And Javier Bardem was great as Triton👏🏻 So all in all. Pretty satisfied."
"Disney, Disney, DisneyCome on Disney get it together! This movie was horrible the cgi was so bad! Flounder and Scuttle will give me nightmares for months... Sebastian reminded me of Mr Krabbs from SpongeBob. This movie lacked so much it really made me sad because I looked forward to this movie. Melissa McCarthy's Ursula was great but then again she is beyond amazing... I wanted to love this but sadly the cgi did me in. The only reason I gave this any stars was so I could actually review it. I really wish that Disney would STOP remaking movies and actually come up with something original. If you get vertigo I wouldn't suggest seeing this... if you do not want your children to have nightmares because of flounder do not see this."
"2 hours 15 minutes of boredom. My daughter fell asleep halfway through.Rob Marshall's new live action Little Mermaid was a film my daughter and I were extremely excited for, in spite of the excessive runtime. Sadly this ended up being by far the worst live action Disney production I have seen in the modern era. I am deeply saddened to say Halle Bailey just didn't capture the charm of the Ariel character, and the chemistry was nonexistent with her co stars.

Disney has been declining in quality for quite some time, but I really had high hopes, as I love this story, and the animated film so much. Obviously some will still find something to enjoy, but I highly recommend you at least wait for streaming on this one. Over two and a half hours for young children is way too much to sit through, and adults are going to have a rough experience making it through the whole movie."
"Halle Bailey smashes it.The controversy surrounding the casting of this film, mainly the lead role shadowed this film. It shouldn't, Halle Bailey was simply awesome as Aerial. Her voice is majestic and she doesn't put a foot or fin wrong the whole movie.

It's reasonably faithful to the original with a few extra bits. Mellissa McCarthy looks like she was having a blast as Ursula.

The songs are all here and Bailey smashes every one of them.

In some scenes it did feel a little washed out on the colours and lacking contrast.

My two daughter loved it. The little Mermaid was my wife's favourite Disney film growing up and she really enjoyed it as did I."
"Watch and You'll See.Hats off to Disney for finally producing a good live action rendition of a classic film in awhile. After the recent slate of films I was beginning to get worried with the outcome of ""The Little Mermaid"". Halle Bailey does such a fantastic job with her vocals and proves she deserved this role. Followed by Melissa McCarthy perfectly casted for Ursula had another fantastic performance. Providing enough comedic relief to not washout a scene or become an unwatchable bit was nice. Lastly Daveed Diggs was amazing as Sebastian. Probably one the the only characters I was worried to see in this film actually was one of the big saving points of this picture. Under water CGI is one that will not sit well with me however was not as bad as the trailers may have made them appear. Disney managed to capture the story of ""The Little Mermaid"" and transform it into a good live action version making it one of the better Disney live action films but not my favourite."
"Anemic, Soulless, garbageI honestly wanted this to be good, and, as my top 5 Disney musical, I figured I would at least enjoy it for the music even if it wasn't innovative. It was not only bad, but it actual was distressing just how bad it was. The cartoon has better timing, better singing, better effects and framing, and better acting.

The live action has stilted scenes with weird transitions, the worst acting I've seen in a while, with zero chemistry between the actors to the point I question if they were even in the same space while performing. The cgi is unremarkable. The singing was... bland, with an honestly disjointed score that didn't work well.

By far the worst thing Disney has made since Aladin 2."

"Feeling Mixed, but still GoodThe first impression of The Little Mermaid gave me that it is overly used in CGI. We have all CGI underwater creatures dancing and the mermaids with their fins was too over saturated with it. Plus, I prefer the 1989 original better because of its great voice acting and classic performances. However, Halle Bailey does a great job acting as Ariel especially in her singing. Her singing alone is what brought the movie to life. I also liked the singing performances of Eric (Jonah Hauer-King), Sebastian (Daveed Diggs), and Scuttle (Awkwafina). The cinematography was good as well as it brings a Pirates of the Caribbean look to the movie. From the ships, ocean, and the loot in the movie was all nice to see. Overall, The Little Mermaid is good with its acting, singing, and performances. I would recommend The Little Mermaid in theaters for a feel-good Disney remake watch."
"Utterly Charmless and DisappointingWhen I went to see this movie, I was prepared for another lifeless Disney remake. I was ready for the unnecessary departures from the original, the excessive CGI, and the ridiculous character designs. I had even braced myself for what I was sure would be cringey new songs and storylines. But what I wasn't prepared for was just how irritating all these things would be together when strung out over a two hour period.

The new songs weren't just bad, they mind-numbingly annoying - particularly Awkwafina's song ""Scuttlebutt"". The old songs were arranged so charmlessly that even the beautiful Halle Bailey couldn't save them. Speaking of Halle, the character design involved so much CGI that at points, it really felt like watching her head on some kind of fake puppet body. It was a really strange and uncanny feeling that was compounded by the dull colors inexplicably chosen by the design team to give the movie a dark, forbidding feeling - in utter contrast to the songs and dialogue.

If you're curious about watching this movie, even for the nostalgia, I would recommend saving your money. Wait until it comes out on Disney+ so you can stream it as background noise for the kids at the next big family gathering.

Overall - it's boring, it's lifeless, and it's incredibly irritating (even by today's low movie standards). I went into this movie expecting just another cash grab, swing-and-a-miss by Disney, and I was still utterly disappointed."
"Pleasing to Watch and Better Than the OriginalGrowing up, I watched many animated films, but I never made my way around to watching The Little Mermaid until later in life. I think maybe for that reason it didn't do much for me. I think it's a very well-told fantasy film, but it just never stuck with me. Well, as always, I'll give anything a shot, so I went to check out the 2023 live-action version and I must say, this is the one that I will choose to rewatch in the future. I was very pleasantly surprised at the translation and additions. Whether you're a fan or not, I believe this one is worth your time.

In this musical, the story plays out the same way you remember if you've seen the original film. Ariel (Halle Bailey) is a Mermaid who wishes to live her own life and become a human to see what life is like outside of the sea. After making a deal with Ursula (Melissa McCarthy), she gains human legs and must share a kiss with Prince Eric (Jonah Hauer-King), otherwise, she will be forced to stay in Ursula's captivity forever. From start to finish, the story is the same, but it's the additions that made me like the story even more. Unlike some other Disney live-action adaptations, they took care here in fleshing out the story in a richer way.

From great additional song numbers to more time given to the romance between Ariel and Eric, I just found this film to be filled with more substance. Like any live-action adaptation, it's hard not to compare it to the original, especially if you've seen it multiple times. This film stands on its own and in many ways is superior in the fact that even the character of Ariel feels stronger. Getting to the surface and experiencing the human world for the first time felt authentic. Not to mention, this entire movie is sold on the fact that Halle Bailey is spectacular.

This casting was honestly perfection. Her vocal talents and even acting abilities far exceeded any of my expectations. Her quiet character moments and even the way she would react to certain things had me emotional or smiling. I can't wait to see what she does next. Without giving anything away, I also thought Eric's musical number, which is completely original to this version, was performed very well by Jonah Hauer-King.

The Little Mermaid isn't a story that I gravitate towards, so I'm honestly impressed at how much I ended up enjoying it. I could complain about the fact that the bright and colourful imagery under the sea clashed with the standard look of the outside world, but that's just nitpicking and it was probably done on purpose. I could also complain that the CGI wasn't perfect all the time, but the voice talent of Daveed Diggs as Sebastian stole the show on multiple occasions and at times was my favourite part of the movie. Look, it's not a perfect movie, but I didn't think the original was either and this one improves on it in my opinion. I had a great time watching it and I say check it out."
"Could've have been a mostly flawless classic*Spoiler free*

Let's start with the good; Halle Bailey en Jonah Hauer-King. They really gave it their all, and managed to turn in honest performances, especially Halle sing these classic songs I knew from childhood, really made me tear up. And their chemistry was off the charts delightful.

I loved Noma Dumezweni as Queen Selina, Art Malik as Grimsby, and of course Melissa McCarthy, as Ursula simply played honest rwally well when needed, and gave bigger performances when needed.

And that's the glue that hold this movie together in my opinion.

The bad:

Javier Bardem as Triton is just teriible, no emotion, nothing. I dreaded his scenes. Just teriible.

Sebastian not being played by an actor with a caribbean background who would have natural caribbean accent, now it feels like a caricature. This just feels so wrong, I'm from a caribbean cultured country, just no.

I'm sorry but awkafina is annoying in anything she's in, can we stop with her please. Her acting is good enough to overcome this.

Scenes felt rushed, especially the scenes when there has been a fall out, we didn't linger to see the actor really show what the characters where feeling. We cut to next day/next moment scenes. I remember saying oh but what about, ok Neverending because the next scene was starting.

Overall an enjoyable film when expectations are lowered, the flaws can be overlooked helped a lot by the wonderfull performances I noted eary on."
"So very, very, very terribleWay to ruin my childhood, Disney.

Underwater scenes are underwhelming. Someone said it's to make it seem ""more realistic"" about the dark depths of the sea. Bruh, it's a movie about a mermaid and talking fish. We left ""realistic"" behind a loooooong time ago.

Scuttle is a chick, played by Awkwafina. Fitting, as she sounds like a seagull every time she opens her mouth, but this particular seagull also apparently has gills. Seriously, the bird hangs out and talks under water. And wth was that horrific ""musical number"" they gave her?! Uncle. I'm saying uncle, yet no mercy was given.

ALL of the characters were so far off from the original that my daughter legit ASKED if Ariel was Ariel, Ursula was Ursula, and asked if ""the creepy guy in armor"" was supposed to be King Triton. (I later also had to bribe said child with McDonald's to get her to sit and watch the incredibly over-long movie.)

Halle Bailey is lovely. She is. But she's also NOT Ariel, and she's utterly incapable of both acting and delivering dialog at the same time. Thankfully she was silent a lot of the movie, so the torture was minimal. Although, despite supposedly losing her voice to Ursula, chick was singing...in her head..? At parts of the movie? Way to utterly undermine the whole point of the second half of the (again, overlong) film.

Ariel's vocals were entirely unnecessary in ""Under the Sea,"" and do I even need to call into question the jellyfish thing? Ffs.

Sebastien was godawful. Whoever they have doing his voice lacks the bass, baritone, and general personality the original actor had.

Flounder was barely in the movie. At all.

Prince Eric is decent, or was until they gave him a wretched number to sing that I quite thankfully can't really recall. They decided he was brought to the castle in a shipwreck and added a(n adopted?) mother to the movie...for really no reason at all. The actress was fine, but the scenes with her in them really just seemed like nonsensical filler. And a movie that's 2+ hours long does NOT need filler. Hell, they could've easily trimmed 45 minutes off the film and maybe it would've been better paced/more cohesive.

They completely removed the adorable scene where Sebastien's in the kitchen. Strike #862.

That awesome scene in the animated version where Ursula in skinny bish form gets attacked by everything? Barely recognizable in its shoddy enactment.

I'm not saying it was the worst movie I've ever seen. It did some things really well. Like... ... And ....

Yeah. It's that friggin bad."
"Bland, boring, and unmemorableEverything about the movie was hard to look at. The original was so bright and colorful; it was always so fun to watch. This movie is drab, grey, and boring. The fish don't even look realistic, they look disturbing. There's something unsettling about people talking to photo-realistic fish, birds, and crabs that have human voices. Especially when the cgi isn't quite there. The music is no where near as good as the original, and neither is the acting. Honestly, I just can't think of any reason why somebody would choose to watch this version over the original. Like all of the Disney remakes, it'll be popular for less than a month and then vanish from everyone's memory."

"Live action of an animated classic or a loose adaptation of a classic tale?After years of being announced, The Little Mermaid has been released and the time has come to give this verdict that is much more valid than the other opinions of the public. Something really curious happens here and that is that the plot of the film is the same as the 1989 animated version with some changes, but the setting and atmosphere is different which makes the film feel like another free adaptation of the original story. The animated film was clearly set in a European place, this film, on the other hand, as it progresses it is revealed that the plot takes place in some area of the Caribbean. That makes the movie look similar to Pirates of the Caribbean and the truth comes to justify certain changes a bit, including Ariel's. Halle Bailey has generated quite a bit of buzz for her role as Ariel and there are mixed feelings towards her. On one hand, her looks are questionable, but her acting and her singing manage to fit the role of Ariel very well. The voice actress from the animated movie at the end was absolutely right to say that only the spirit of the character mattered and in this case, Halle Bailey manages to be convincing. Melissa McCarthy plays her role well as Ursula and her character comes to resemble her animated counterpart in elegance, although she lacks much more energy. King Triton in appearance is acceptable, but Javier Bardem should have put more effort into the character, since he fails to generate certain sensations like King Triton from the animated movie. Eric is doing quite well and it is necessary to apply that there is much more chemistry between him and Ariel. Sebastian has a rather weird and bizarre design, but his personality is similar to that of the animated movie. Scuttler is pretty cool actually and resembles his animated counterpart. Flounder is a bit disappointing, as his participation is low, he has the cute personality of his animated counterpart, but the design is iffy and his size limits him quite a bit. Ariel's sisters are a curious case, since something that could have made sense and contributed a lot is that King Triton had 7 wives, each one queen of the 7 seas of the world, and that would make some sense to the appearance of Triton's daughters and citizens, and would also have been an interesting element to explore. The thing about the kingdom of Triton was a duty, since there is not a very visible kingdom that we can say and that should have been corrected. A detail to mention is respect for Eric's mother, which at least adds meaning to Eric's character, but it is difficult to say that the queen is Eric's biological mother, since there seems to be more indications that Eric is adopted, but it is not entirely clear. The digital effects are pretty good for the most part. The underwater scenes are spectacular, although there are some that are somewhat dark and difficult to appreciate. The mermaid tails, the scene of Ursula taking Ariel's voice and the final battle are truly amazing. The songs have a different tone and something soft. ""Under The Sea"" becomes somewhat more harmonious than the original version. The said song sequence is quite colorful and mind-blowing, but it's hardly as cartoonish as it is in the animated movie. The ""Poor Unfortunate Souls"" scene is dark and gloomy, which is acceptable, but it does lack some of the spirit of the animated version. The scene of ""Kiss The Girl"" is not very different from the animated version, but it is much softer, since the original version became more emotional. It is true that in the songs there are some modifications in the lyrics, but they are minor details. As a film it's actually well produced and shot, but there's this conflict of being a live action of the animated classic or another loose adaptation of the original tale. The story mostly respects the animated film, but the film itself seems to try to be another loose adaptation by borrowing elements from the animated film. Because of this, the film has a certain freshness, but at the same time some setbacks that make it difficult for the public to see it in a more neutral and constructive way. The 1989 film is so iconic that it has managed to overshadow other adaptations that have been made of the original story and therefore trying to make another adaptation that takes elements of something so iconic has been very controversial. It is among those who favorably viewed this film knowing that it is a kind of variant on the animated classic and then there are those who reject it, either because of Bailey's choice or because they expected to see an exact copy of the animated film in either in production and characters. As another loose adaptation and without the elements of the animated film, it would have been much more acceptable, or without the changes that have been made and having retained many elements of the animated film, it would have been a very good live action of the animated classic. It's like this movie is 50/50 of both and that makes it quite a rarity that generates different sensations. If you try to see it as another free adaptation of the original story, it is much more digestible and you may or may not like it. If you try to see it as a remake of the original animated movie, you may or may not like it as well. Either one or the other, it is a film that undoubtedly generates likes or dislikes depending on the criteria of each person. For this reason, The Little Mermaid (2023) is a peculiar film, difficult to qualify, but at least as a film it manages to be enjoyable. My final rating, unique and valid for this film, is 7/10."

"Enchanting!Ignore any criticisms because this movie is just plain enchanting! Halle Bailey captures all that it means to be Ariel plus more, her voice is a gorgeous siren song that we are blessed to hear, Melissa McCarthy is an amazing and fearsome Ursula. Many comedic beats that hit just right and are fun for kids and adults alike, amazing voice talent Daveed Diggs playing the fun, hilarious and neurotic Sebastian which is reminiscent of the original. The story is rich and has depth and warmth that will enchant children and parents for years to come. This is the next generation's Ariel and her legacy will be known."
"May not be perfect, but is actually an enjoyable movie compared to the other live actions.I'm someone who usually doesn't like the Disney remakes, especially Mulan, Beauty and The Beast and Pinocchio. But I don't want to write them off as all bad as two I genuinely liked was Cinderella and The Jungle Book, movies who tried to utilize the story into something enjoyable. And I believe this movie did that job.

The CGI for the animals and water effects aren't great, also with some of the actors being kinda eh and of course the lyric change to ""Kiss The Girl"" but Halle's performance was really good. Her singing is gorgeous, she tries to really emulate Ariel's energy. Ariel's personality compared to the original is more tweaked, but not by a major difference in my opinion. Her development with Eric felt natural and so sweet. Melissa did her best job as Ursula, she was putting her all into it. Same for the actress for Vanessa, she killed it in her scene.

There are changes to the plot with new info or changes to character lore but it doesn't feel like a slap in the face or a way to make fun of the original. It's not like the most amazing remake of all time in my opinion but I believed the people behind it genuinely tried to make a movie to just enjoy. So I give it a thumbs up. 👍"
"Sometimes it's best to leave things aloneLet me start by saying the original Little Mermaid is my all time favorite Disney movie. I was looking forward to seeing this movie. But sadly, after all the hype and anticipation, this unfortunate remake was NOT even close. Sometimes you just need to leave somethings alone. It's a shame that so much money and talent was wasted on this live version. Sorry, but it's barely watchable. It just didn't work. I brought my daughter and my niece and they really didn't like it. About halfway through I thought I was going to fall asleep, the movie felt like it just dragged on. I really wanted to love it, but I don't even like it. Not every classic Disney movie needs to be live action. Here's a thought, why not come up with some new, original stories and tell them!"
"A spectacular feast for the senses. I implore you to go and see itJust got back from the cinema. I had plenty of time to go over and reflect while in the taxi on the way home.

Now I'm home I can write a review. Now I'm gonna be honest and fair but I'll try not to give too much away. No major spoilers here.

Overall I'm impressed.

It is what is is at the end of the day. A live action remake of a classic animated film. Which doesn't fully capture the heart and soul of the original but it still delivers an enjoyable movie.

It didn't disappoint me, in fact it exceeded my expectations.

I went in with fairly low expectations and I had expected it to be a flawed but still an enjoyable movie and it was just that and more.

My main problem with the movie is that it feels like nostalgia is the main focus of the movie with a few new embellishments here and there.

The music is breathtaking. It really hits you right in the heart. Both score and songs are excellent.

Halle shines as Ariel The Little Mermaid. (I never had any doubts after seeing the trailers that she would make a good Ariel.) and I was right not to doubt her.

Mellisa as Ursula was stunning. She genuinely terrified me at times. I'm in my twenties too and I was scared. One moment she sweet, goofy and crazy the next she's dangerously evil.

The rest of the cast did an amazing job too.

Jonah was a great Eric, he brought some depth to the character and his background.

Plus he and Halle made an adorable couple as Eric and Ariel.

Also his dog Max was freaking cute.

As for the musical moments.

Part of your World and its reprises were brilliant.

For the First Time, not bad, a lot of fun.

Wild Uncharted Waters a bit meh but still ok.

Fathoms Below made me chuckle.

Under the Sea was ok musically and it had spectacular visuals.

Poor Unfortunate Souls blew me away both visually and for the vocal performance.

Loved kiss the Girl, it was romantic but hilarious.

Scuttlebut wasn't as bad as people are saying in fact I enjoyed it. It was a funny silly part of the film.

Jessica as Vanessa wow, we needed more of her, she was a great villain.

The cgi looked better than in the trailers but it still wasn't perfect.

Underwater scenes weren't terrible but also not terribly convincing either.

The on land stuff was much better visually. The landscape was beautiful.

Now in regards to the famous storm scene and Eric is rescued by Ariel, well words cannot do justice to it. Let's just say it was amazing and a true delight. Score, vocals and the visuals.

To wrap up this review. Here are my final thoughts on the film.

I'm fully satisfied and feel like I've used my money wisely and got a reward.

I'd recommend this to anyone who fancies a bit of nostalgia and a good time.

Now when's the dvd coming out? I need it in my collection right now."
"I really should learn my lesson and not have any sort of expectations anymoreSo, as we've repeatedly seen over the last years, Disney doesn't really know what they're doing with these remakes (other than the fact that they're trying to make as much money as possible ofc). And this makes me weirdly conflicted when writing this review, because this movie is better than some of Disney's remakes,but it's still not really that good, it's kinda just ok.

And, just to get it out of the way, Halle Bailey is absolutely amazing, and her voice is phenomenal. And also Javier Bardem is practically a guaranty for quality, so as you can expect, he was quite good in this.

So, first of all, one of the biggest problems I had with the movie is that it feels structured weirdly. The pacing feels off, the first half of the movie (before Arile gets legs) feels long and dragged out, while the second half feels rushed.

Also, I noticed that they made a lot of changes to the story, most not extremely major, which really makes you wonder why they were made in the first place. Probably one of my least favourite is the change of Eric's characterisation and his motivations; it literally feels like the writers opened booktok one day, saw something and said ""that's cool, let's use it"", because it literally feels like they're trying to turn Eric into Elian from ""To Kill a Kingdom"" (minus the grammatically incorrect Greek presented as a made-up language ofc).

Anyway, bottom line is, the movie is OK, just try not to have any sort of expectations going in."
"no redeeming qualitiesI am not the target audience for this and didn't want to see it.

The theatre was about 20% full on release day.

On seeing the running time - it looked too long. It was too long. 45 minutes too long.

The live action animations (if there is such a thing) were weird and distracting. Things that were cute in the cartoon were odd here.

It moves at a glacial pace.

The underwater scenes looked strange.

I found little to enjoy.

That said - noone left early and people seemed to be enjoying it. Maybe I am the minority.

Nice to see Art Malik on the big screen again - been a fan of his for a long time."
"Open mind and fresh eyes are not enoughI know it is a different genre and not to be compared to the original, but even watching with expectations of a fresh take on the story wasn't enough to keep me interested. They tried to make something new but it was too much like a sloppy cookie cutter that it just didn't work. I won't be buying this one. Wait until it's on Disney plus, not worth the cost of a theater experience. I'm trying not to give spoilers but the songs didn't work. The director clearly didn't know what they were doing either this one, I felt like it was all over the place. Melissa did a great job as Ursula but the rest of the casting could have been much better."
"Better then the OrginalIt's amazing how this movie stayed so faithful to the original movie while referencing the original writing but adding so much more character and story. I can say with my full chest that I love this movie for what it turned the little mermaid into. The music is top notch, voice acting top tear and Prince Eric has a real personality and story himself.

There was a whole story outside of the main characters which, I feel, gives everything a bigger weight to it. Instead of it just being about a two people falling in love, it is also about two worlds endangering each other but also still needing one another. It's a beautiful movie that has many massages within it while still giving us everything amazing that the original movie was."
"Enjoyed the unexpected additions, the traditional songs and the Disney beauty in Under the SeaI haven't sent the original since it came out so perhaps I don't remember everything but there seemed to be some unexpected twists in this remake that I enjoyed. The Under The Sea song had the traditional magic and colorful playfulness that I expect in an animated Disney flick. So I was glad that they incorporated it into this Live Action. Ursula was not as evil as I remembered. I loved the choices and voices the team made, especially Scuttle as a female (go Awkafina), McCarthy, using Daveed Digs who always shines and bringing a strength and diversity to King Triton's daughters. He was very endearing as well. They only negative for me was the 1st 2 original songs. Awkward and not well thought out. Overall entertaining and that was a pleasant surprise."

A CGI NightmareHonestly for me this was rough to get through. The acting/singing was fine and totally passable however the low budget CGI made the movie feel as if it would have been more successful had it just gone straight to Disney + instead of theatres. This isn't really Theatre quality or worth the price of admission. The sea creatures suffer terribly from uncanny valley and the underwater CGI simply makes it look like they are floating in space rather than actually underwater.(Even Aquaman did better in this regard). All they did was toss a blue filter over everything and make computer generated hair. Idk personally took me out of the movie. The plot itself is pretty basic and one dimensional as anticipated with certain parts feeling quite forced as i felt like chemistry was lacking between the male lead and female lead. Overall 3/10 maybe fun for the kids at home on the sofa.
"Good! But a bit anticlimacticI think Halle made a wonderful Ariel. She has a beautiful voice! I think all of the main cast was casted really well. This was one of the better, if not best Disney remake. It stayed pretty true to the story. The only complaint I had with this, and it's the same issue I have with most of the Disney remakes, is that the villain sequences continue to be anticlimactic. This was not as bad as Aladdin where they omitted Jafar turning into a snake altogether, but the wedding sequence went very quickly and it would have been very visually stunning to see Vanessa's legs turn into tentacles and see her crawling across the floor. I'm glad they included the giant Ursela, but it was over way too soon in my opinion. Overall, not as good as its cartoon counterpart, but still a winner."

"The Little Mermaid Remake Was More Of Like The Cringe MermaidThe Little Mermaid, another unnecessary Disney remake, i'd say that the first 40 minutes of the film was just awful, from the bad CGI, Javier Bardem awful performance as King Triton, when he rage he doesn't even feel like he's raging, he's supposed to be menacing and scary when he taught Ariel, instead he is so flat in this movie, the first performance of Part Of Your World was fills with awkward pauses and cringe improvisation, the second one was as cringe, and you can compare the Under The Sea performance to the 1989 version and you can notice the missing energy, that whole thing happen in the first 40 minutes, and the rest of The Little Mermaid was improving but still no good, i enjoy Halle Bailey performance more in the rest of the movie i guess because she's not speaking at all, Jonah Haurer-King was not good either at first ok at the end, and so do the rest of the cast really, except Melissa McCarthy as Ursula, she was decent all the way through and possibly the best performance in the film, i just have so many more problems with the movie, so many cringe scene and bad voice acting not forget to mention, it felt so stupid to watch, so cringe to watch, even the audience was laughing on how stupid it is and i followed them, sure there is still couple of cute and giggles moment, but the rest i'm in the cringe, three or more new song and i only like one of them, it's too long, it's pretty boring, it's cringe silly, and i don't like it, overall The Little Mermaid remake was more of like The Cringe Mermaid."
"Spectacular. Magical. A window into another world.This movie was spectacular from start to finish.

The level of talent on display here - from the cast, to the direction, to the musical arrangements, to the incredibly realistic CGI - is as vast as the open sea.

Halle Bailey's performance as Ariel is a masterclass in acting. Particularly when she loses her voice and has to communicate through body language, she showcases her unique ability to make us hear her without words, to express her longing and her desire for a new life without uttering a sound.

Her singing is utterly magical as well. She takes what the magnificent Jodi Benson did in the 1993 film and builds on it in interesting and exciting new ways, and I can't wait to listen to the soundtrack and the score over and over and over again to revisit the wonder and majesty of it all.

Jonah Hauer-King was excellent as Prince Eric. One of his songs - a new tune composed for the movie about his intense desire for Ariel to ""come find him again"" - is among the best of the new material, and he performs it beautifully.

Javier Bardem as King Triton brings a gravitas to the underwater portions of the film that Bardem brings to every performance, frankly. He is a fantastic actor, and he showcases King Triton's fears and concerns for his wayward daughter in every facial expression.

Melissa McCarthy is an absolute standout as Ursula. She channels a combination of a drag persona and Kathleen Turner in her later years to come up with a performance that's new to her while being highly effective, relatable, and, above all else, immensely entertaining. She has some of the best comic relief in the film.

I would be remiss not to mention the work of Alan Menken here. He's taken his original score to the 1993 film and expanded on it in ways that will linger with me for weeks after watching. The new songs are phenomenal, thanks to new arrangements by Menken that bring out all new spectacular moments in the score. Lin-Manuel Miranda, the genius behind Hamilton, puts his considerable lyrical skills to work here as well.

Rob Marshall's direction was top notch. The shipwreck and early above-water scenes were so intensely shot. I was on the edge of my seat. The story seemed to move at a natural pace, and the direction showed us exactly what we needed to see at any given moment to carry us into the next scene. This is among his best work ever, rivalling the masterpiece Chicago and eclipsing Into the Woods.

It's a phenomenal movie, one that needs to be experienced in the largest theater possible to really capture what I felt watching this: the sense of awe, of joy, of sadness, of wonder; the chills down my spine as Halle Bailey & Co. Transported us under the sea into a spectacularly realized world that I'm sure we all wish we could visit too.

It will be stuck in my head for weeks.

A triumph!"
"Good, Not Great; Pleasant Not EngagingOverall, this movie was pleasant, but not engaging. The reason, in my view, is that the direction was average. Accordingly, C- on Direction. The visual production was fine, but everything yields to the Director. Eric's song had a very strange and unpleasant sound mix.

As to the casting, overall good job. I did not prefer Bardem as Triton, too clumsy, or Dumezweni as the Queen, too flat. McCarthy did a standout job as Ursula. Bailey fine as Ariel. The world-view cast worked well for this story, with a lot of different ethnicities for the world-wide body of water kingdom. Disney reconciled the difference in ethnicity between Eric and the Queen by making him adopted, which is okay.

Also, the pacing was off, sometimes too slow and sometimes too fast, understanding that the story needs some visuals that don't really move the story forward, although some of the CGI was less than stellar; that is, noticeable.

Overall, I can't say I loved it and I can't say I hated it. It was pleasant. This type of a movie really needs to be in the hands of a proven master for the genre, like a Spielberg. Particularly following a masterpiece animated version, the Director has to meet the task. Marshall does a good job, not a great job, a good job. This could have been a masterpiece, because all the piece were there, but I know it, if I feel it, but I never really was so engaged that I felt it. Perhaps there are so many political and operational constraints at Disney that he was constrained to what got produced as less than great, but he's the Director."
"There was no point for this movie to be madeMost of the plot remains the same as the orginal, alott of muted colours and also weird new songs like The Scuttlebutt. All the new songs don't fit with the orginal songs of the movie and some original songs like Poor Unfortunate Souls where changed for stupid reasons that didn't made sens in the story. Ursula was lying in the orginal song to convince Ariel to give up her voice. The CGI animals look terrible and the underwater scenes look fake. Also Eric isn't even a real Prince in this version but an adopted son of the Queen, what never makes him in line for the throne in reality. Weird change also is to change all the sisters of Ariel their name. The Father and sisters of Ariel don't even look like her with all the changes made for diversity. Awkwafina her voice acting was horrible in the movie. Acting of Eric and ariel feels empty when they are alone. Melissa McCarthy looked like she was bored with filming the movie in some scenes. There was no real point for making this movie and there isn't a point for watching it if you saw the orginal animated movie already."
Not worth the watchI wouldn't waste your time on this movie I rather be stuck in an elevator with carrot top then go see this train wreck I mean really your gonna destroy a beautiful masterpiece that walt disney and his people made when they worked on the cartoon version to me that is an insult to him and his legacy and I know many true Disney fans would agree the original will always be the best of the best at first I was gonna give it a try but finding out they made so many changes makes me wanna barf I will forever remain loyal to the original because that s part of my childhood and by doing this is destroying it.
"A magical adventure!I have been waiting for this movie for years, and yesterday I finally got to see it in 3D! It was overall just a great time and I was not disappointed.

This movie stays very close to the animated one, which I was hoping for. A couple iconic scenes have been changed/cut from this one, which was a shame, but overall they included everything we loved and just made scenes longer or added scenes and a couple songs.

The cast is perfect IMO. Everyone does a great job, but the highlights are without a doubt Halle and Melissa as Ariel and Ursula. Halle is absolutely beautiful inside and out and you can see that go into Ariel. And her voice... MY GOD it gave me chills. Absolutely incredible, I had tears in my eyes every time she sang. Melissa camps the hell out as Ursula and it works perfectly, down to the singing and her manerisms. That's not an easy challenge! Surprisingly, Sebastian is a main scene stealer. His voice and accent is perfect, and Scuttle worked pretty well too. Flounder is there. He's cute. I was happy with Prince Erik too. They gave him more of a backstory and motivation, and the chemistry between him and Ariel is impeccable.

Songs are great and visual effects are stunning. All in all a great time, and the best Disney live action movie since Beauty & The Beast. I only took a couple points of for a couple missing scenes that I really wanted to see."
"Halle Bailey is a Star.Is this a 7 star movie? Probably not. It's probably closer to a 6.5 star movie. That said, Halle Bailey blew me away. Not just because her singing was chill inducing (I got goosebumps during the Part of That World song), but her acting as Ariel was sublime. She was youthful, spirited, innocent, and just nailed the Disney Princess vibe. Halle IS Ariel and is the best casting I've ever seen in a live action remake.

That said, I do not think that the rest of the movie lived up to the standard that Bailey set. Melissa McCarthy was fine as Ursula, but seemed like she had a difficult time making the role her own and struggled with the song. I wish she would've actually sang the song, and if she didn't feel comfortable singing, she shouldn't have accepted the role.

The actor who played Eric did a good job, but his song that he sang was terrible. Which isn't his fault. That scene should've been taken out.

Daveed Diggs and Awkwafina were fun as Sebastian and Scuttle. The new material given to them is where they actually got to shine. I thought that Awkwafina did a better job with the original dialogue than Diggs did, but when Diggs was given new/fresh dialogue, he stole the show. Diggs also did a great job vocally.

I didn't have an issue with the VFX. The movie was more colorful than the trailers were, so Disney obviously listened to the criticism.

Overall, this wasn't a terrible movie. But I don't think it did enough to warrant existing. I hope Halle Bailey takes off after this because she's a wonderful actress and was a revelation."
"Disney has lost its magicFirst of all the original is the greatest Disney film ever made. This movie was a washed up fish on the shores slowly dying of terrible writing, terrible casting, terrible animation and graphics and terrible vocals. The little mermaid is know for the music and voice that's the meaning of the movie. This movie was a complete joke! The graphic of the film killed the original characters. Who did the casting and writing for this film needs to get another job asap. When watching this horribly made film it's Missing the main thing in Disney and that is magic. There was no magic or joy in this film. Do yourself a favor and don't see this film. It's as terrible as Aladdin live action. No Magic."
"Surprisingly Amazing!I have hated most of Disneys remakes, they have just been unnecessary and bad! I was expecting the same for this movie especially cause flounder looked so weird. But this movie was incredible! The special effects were realistic and beautiful, the songs amazing and just different enough to not be exactly like the original but still nostalgic! Under the sea was like scuba diving on a high! The only part that sucked was Sebastian and Flounder, both had 0 personality and a weird look, but other than that it was perfect! You wont be disappointed, definitely worth a watch. I have been singing all the songs and pretending my husband is a prince from a beach the last hour!"

"One of the few kids films I wish I never agree to see.I have either been dragged or agreed to go see most of the kid's films that are so-called ""big budget"", and most have either been good or bearable....this was painful, boring and missed the mark for keeping anyone other than young girls entertained.

It's not my kind of film; even the original was not for me, but that was at a time when Disney (after Lion King saved them) could do no wrong, and the films just worked...even the songs. This one does not translate well to live-action and CGI, which looks odd at times.

There has been a lot said of who they picked for the part and all that, and though I think they should stick to what the story says, it's the studio's money, so they can do what they want.

Even though I am no fan of the animated film, I remember that one being good for the family, male/female, but this one is very sickly sweet and feels way more pushed for girls to like.

You know, what would have worked better would have been to do like Roger Rabit, a mix of animated and live action.

I give it 4/10 and thats trying to be kind."
"Refined & Delightful!The story was wonderful and although some things in the plot were changed, it benefited. The music, the culture and the inclusive characters really has made this a masterpiece and worth seeing! The movie definitely brings more humor and sparkle. The movie also brings more heartwarming moments and it is full of vibrant color. However, some of the scenes didnt make sense and were a bit confusing like when the bird talked underwater. The graphics under ""the sea"" wasnt the best, felt less authentic. Although the movie dives more into Eric's character which is appreciated, I wish it provided more of a depth into Ariel's. All in all, a very lively refined movie to the authentic classic everyone is hoping for!"
"Good but....I enjoyed this live action remake probably more than any other live action remake from Disney. It's just hard to recapture that magic from their original version. Little mermaid kind of does that better than the other attempts. This might disappoint those wanting an exact shot for shot remake of the cartoon.

Halle Bailey is absolutely wonderful. Those choosing to skip this entry because of the color of her skin are missing an incredible performance. Halle has some pipes on her. Think broadway singer underwater. I'm glad I saw this in AMC Dolby because that sound was projected beautifully. Halle puts a lot of power behind her vocals and the Dolby captures that perfectly. Melissa McCarthy played Ursula amazingly. Really captures the original version but still adds her style to it. Javier Bardem was wonderful and Jonah Hauer-King playing Prince Eric really balanced out the cast. The biggest surprise though and the one that to me kind of stole the show was Daveed Diggs as Sebastian. Every scene he was in was probably my favorites. Especially the Kiss the Girl song part. That whole sequence had me and the rest of the theater dying. Awkwafina and Jacob Tremblay were also great additions to their iconic parts.

Really the only thing that irked me was the visual design. Flounder, Scuttle and Sebastian's design were just nightmare fuel. The underwater shots and final sequence also looked incomplete. I kind of felt like maybe the VFX wasn't finished or as polished. Those that complained about GoT too dark during battle sequences might have the same issue here.

The movie had 3 additional songs and they were fine but the movie could've done without them to cut down on time. This really felt longer than it should have been. Some extra scenes were necessary but others they could have done without.

All in all I had a good time watching this and really that doesn't matter because the kids that attended my screening all seemed to enjoy it as I could hear them burst with excitement. I had the version I grew up with and now it looks like they will have their own. Good flick!"
"Not as bad as it could have been, but still unnecessaryI had been against the live-action adaptation of The Little Mermaid since they first announced it. I was worried this would be a poor, unfortunate, soulless remake of a Disney classic. However, I didn't hate this movie as much as I thought I was going to. Halle Bailey did a good job portraying the charming innocence of Ariel, and the visual effects were mostly enjoyable. Nevertheless, the new songs were forgettable (or laughable), the altered plot points were pointless, Javier Bardem was cold, and the CG animal sidekicks were off-putting. It's not as bad as it could have been, but it's still unnecessary."
"Don't like itDisappointing lackluster rendition.

First and foremost, the animation quality was a major letdown. The charm and beauty of hand-drawn animation, which defined the original film, were replaced with lackluster CGI that lacked depth and character. The characters seemed lifeless, their movements stiff and unnatural, making it difficult to connect with them on an emotional level. The vibrancy and fluidity that breathed life into the underwater world of Ariel were sorely missed.

Beyond the animation, the remake felt devoid of the very essence that made the original so enchanting. The captivating and immersive story that effortlessly weaved love, sacrifice, and personal growth was lost in this adaptation."

"I wanna be where the jokes areAs a huge Little Mermaid fan, I was so excited to see this new adaptation. For the most part, I thoroughly enjoyed what the team at Disney came up, and Halle completely stole the show as Ariel.

I wish so much that they would have utilized the COMEDY more than they did. There were so many moments where they could have ""found the funny"" and they just didn't. Too many moments that fell flat for me. If you're going to cast Melissa McCarthy AND Awkwafina, then use them! I wanted the comedians in this movie to take it so much further. It's like they were afraid to make a joke for the sake if the film, but movies like this can afford to be silly."
"TerribleWanted to love it given the fact that the Little Mermaid has been my favorite Disney Princess movie ever since I was born. They seriously need to leave things alone, especially good things. Disney really needs to work on becoming more original, I would love to see new Princesses and new story lines. Instead they keep changing all the great old ones because they aren't great enough to figure something else out. No nostalgic feel, music sucked, characters looked weird especially the way they made the sea life look, so dark with no vibrancy like the original. Loved Halle's voice and she's a beautiful person but it just wasn't working. None of the characters and songs matched up or made you feel any way. With how this turned out so don't even want to see the Show White remake."
"Superb!!!!!!The live action Little Mermaid is amazing! Halle Bailey did a fantastic job portraying Ariel. She has a great voice and brought new life to so many beloved songs. I hope they make a sequel.

Mellisa McCarthy was also great as Ursula. It's amazing how much she looks like the animated Ursula. Her costume and makeup were amazing! She also added her own style to the characters.

The special effects were also great. In the underwater scenes you feel like the characters are under water without having to be in murky water where it's hard to see what's going on. The visuals were also amazing!

The diverse cast, sets, costumes, and props made this a must see movie for the entire family!"
"Overall good theater experience & one you should check out with the family .Left me start off by saying I went into this movie completely unbiased as someone who never really seen the first movie & had a pleasant time with this film. Halle Bailey did amazing job casting as Ariel with her curious childlike charm & her tender voice, it was like she was born for this role! The whole casting crew did a good job with what they had to work with.

David Diggs as Sebastian the crab was entertaining & funniest. Also think Melissa McCarthy did a really good job, didn't really know what to expect from her because some of her recent work from different movies have been very hit or miss for me.

Couple of things that didn't work well with the film was CGI visuals. It was like a rollercoaster the lighting was too dark In some parts of the movie but visuals gets better as it progress. Most of the sea animals looked too artificial & their movements. Some of the musical performances fell flat. I felt like this movie was a little too long & definitely could've been trimmed down ."
"the original is betterThe cgi in some scenes looks pretty weird, as avatar has elevated the way you record and do cgi underwater. The way they made the animals are so strange it seems that they have no life or emotions, as if it were all superfluous, the way the villain is not afraid, I tried to like it more it's just another live action to get rid of sales and reversals of products, without anything very original and without any kind of Disney charm and magic that we were I'm used to seeing it, anyway the Ericks don't have much charisma and it's just Erick with nothing, at the end of it all it's just another live action to be forgotten in a few months."
"Wonderfully surprised!I honestly didn't go in with high expectations, but rather an open mind. You truly can't go in thinking it will be exactly the same as or better than the original, and you can't really fault it for being different... new cast, new era and updates are always going to give it a new take.

That being said, I am happy to report that I LOVED IT! Ariel and Eric were fantastic, Tritan had more empathy than the original in the end, all the sisters were gorgeous, Sebastian was funny looking but his micro expressions made him super lovable (however you can't beat the original), and Melissa as Ursula?! Perfection!!!!!! We also *hated* Vanessa just as much, if not more, as we did in the original, so the girl was spot on. Honestly, the casting was great!

In terms of music, old greats are still awesome, the song Scuttlebutt was a bit eek, but the rest of the new songs were great!

For a moment I was thinking it could have been more colorful, but then I realized that the tones and palette were probably pretty darn close to reality.

I think that out of all the remakes I can remember off the top of my head (Jungle Book, The Lion King, Aladdin, Wendy & Peter... there are probably more, but if I can't remember them I'm guessing it's because they didn't stand out), this is my favorite! Totally will watch it again (would even pay to see it in a theater again!)."
"The soulless animals in a great musicalWhen reviewing the CGI of the sea animals, I was horrified by how dead and soulless they looked. They looked nothing like the original characters. But the positive is Hailey Bailey's stunning performance. Her voice is so powerful and firm. She was the blood and bones of the movie. Every scene she takes place is a magical ride. Eric was portrayed in a good way while exploring his backstory. He too had a fantastic voice. Unfortunately the new added songs were generic and unremarkable. But one thing this movie gets right is the casting of the characters. Hailey Bailey was an excellent actress to fill the role of Ariel. It may not be a masterpiece, but it does the job for a live action remake."

"Not great.The voices and changes to the songs are a huge distraction. They all have far different tones of voice than the original cast. The difference serve as a distraction, not in a good way. It feels like a different film but it's being billed as a remake. There's also things that make no sense history wise. Too much harmony for those times. There's so many unnecessary changes that it's charged the whole experience, I guess since I'm a fan of the original I was hoping for an homage. So much waiting around for the release, and I'm very disappointed in what's being presented here. I guess the switched genres too."
"Amazing movieFirst of all, Halle Bailey deserves all her flowers for taking on the role of such a beloved Disney character. She is bold, brave and beautiful - everything we love about Ariel.

Whilst some elements like the CGI were a hit and miss - Melissa Mccarthy, Jonah King and Daveed Diggs were outstanding. The film also added elements to make it more relevant to the audience of today. The story follows a lot of the original but does add a few twists that definitely worked.

As a huge fan of Disney and someone who is very interested in reliving elements of my childhood as an adult - this film did just that.m."
"Some movies shouldn't be remade.The only character who was played properly was the little mermaid. The rest of the actors did not suit their roles. Including Melissa McCarthy - and I'm a huge McCarthy fan!!

It seemed very rushed towards the end and the drama was taken away from Ariel's reveal. The songs were really good, maybe better than the original. But the movie was not better than the original. Some things don't need to change.

The movie was strongly anticipated but it seems like everyone who sees it is being let down sadly. This was my favourite princess story from my childhood so I was desperate to see it and I just feel disappointed."
"Just Bad In So Many WaysYou would think that with the budget put in to this it would be good. That's sadly far from the reality. They just shouldn't make a live action if they can't make it better than the original. It's way to long and felt soulless a lot of the time. The CGI was just really bad and I was disappointed in the way they created some of the characters. Save yourself the time and just re-watch the original.

The squawking song made my skin crawl listening to it. I thought with Lin Manuel Miranda signing on to do the songs it would be amazing new songs but they're far from enjoyable. The original animation was so much better for so many reasons."
"Near perfect!Honestly, my expectations were low. I was very nervous to see it but regardless we took the kids on opening night.

This was nothing short of a masterpiece and it was dang near perfect.

Everything was flawless. The cast was perfect. The music was spot on, the visuals were incredible!!! (Must see in 3D).

I was captivated the whole time and wished that it was twice as long.

All the epic scenes were done masterfully and some new ones were a delightful addition.

This is by far the best disney remake and it deserves to be up for multiple awards.

As for the Ariel casting, it not only brought a whole mew dynamic but it made you wonder why Ariel looked the way she did when it takes place in a more tropical location. Bravo Disney.

I don't always agree with you as a company but this I am a fan of."

"This movie is so bad!""The Little Mermaid"" is an absolute disaster of a film. With a convoluted plot, poorly developed characters, and lackluster performances, it fails on multiple fronts. The dialogue feels forced and cringe-worthy, making it hard to emotionally invest in any of the characters. The special effects are subpar, failing to create a believable world. The pacing is all over the place, leaving the audience confused and disengaged. Even the soundtrack feels out of place, adding to the overall disappointment. Save yourself the agony and skip this cinematic catastrophe.

Don't need to watch this movie if you are a movies lover. Watch something better!"
"A fun remakeDisney has adapted their 1989 animated film, The Little Mermaid into a live action film with Rob Marshall directing, Dion Beebe providing the Cinematography, and songs written by Alan Menken and Lin-Manuel Miranda. It stars Halle Bailey from The Lion King and the upcoming The color purple. Also starring Melissa McCarthy, Jonah Hauer-King from The Lion King, Daveed Diggs, Jacob Tremblay, and Awkwafina from Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings and Raya and the Last Dragon. Last but not least is Javier Bardem from Pirates of the Caribbean- Dead Men Tell No Tales.

Ariel (Halle Bailey), is a mermaid who wants to live in the human world with Prince Eric (Jonah Hauer-King), after saving him from a ship wreck. Ariel's dad, King Triton (Javier Bardem) forbids it, which forces Ariel to make a dangerous deal with Ursula (Melissa McCarthy), a sea witch.

This version of the Little Mermaid isn't 100 percent a copy of the original. They have made changes so that the film would stand out from the original. My favorite change was when Ursula's tentacles lit up, I feel it illuminated her scenes. I thought they should have kept Flounder's (Jacob Tremblay) color the same from the original film. Here I found his coloring a little weird.

At first I wasn't sure about Sebastian (Daveed Diggs) due to him not looking like a normal crab but he won me over by playing his part well and delivering some funny lines. Ariel is my favorite Disney princess, so I was extremely happy that Bailey did a great job portraying Ariel. She sang ""Part of your World"" beautifully. Bardem wasn't as convincing as he could have been playing King Triton, I feel he didn't show how angry he was at Ariel when he was destroying her collection of human artifacts. In my opinion, the best performance in this film was McCarthy as Ursula, she can sing and she did an amazing job being menacing yet being someone audiences love. Just like Sebastian, Scuttle (Awkwafina) was funny. The song Scuttle and Sebastian sang together in the palace was really humorous. Hauer-King was a good prince Eric who got a little more of a story this time around. He and Ariel both wanted to explore uncharted places.

John Myhre, the production designer filmed the scenes on a blue screen, and the actors just preformed the swimming movements in the air. This was impressive!. All the scenes looked realistic under the sea. I would recommend any Disney fan to go see this live action Little Mermaid."
"The Little Meh-maidAs far as all these reimagining live action movies are going this one wasn't that bad really I suppose. I managed to sit through it without having to say ""ugh"" every 10 minutes as they destroyed another childhood memory. They made it different enough so that it wasn't just a shot for shot but some of the iconic moments should've been kept true. All the animals aside from scuttle where just mundane because they were realistic so had no pizazz, Flounder didn't stick out AT ALL and Sebastian was about as flamboyant as a crab stick served with ketchup. His voice and personality were tame and ""Under The Sea"" was just so boring! With none of the other sea creatures joining in to sing just a few cucumbers and jellyfish floating about with Ariel filling in for the other lyrics.

With Ariel I never really felt that she loved Eric, barely a mild crush. The land of the merpeople was barren with only King Triton and his weirdly varied children, yeah let's get diverse but this dude specifically has a child of every race going aside from Navajo which is probably on his list.

Eric's island was nicely fleshed out giving us a glimpse around a beautifully colourful Caribbean town.

I will say Ursula was achieved well by McCarthy, she seemed to be the only person who put some effort in to the role.

I know why Disney keep churning these out but also I don't. They should concentrate on the lesser known ones like Basil the mouse detective and Rescuers, they would make great movies brought up to date with todays tech, these blockbusters are all just dire and ruin everyone's expectations. The only really half decent one they've managed is Lady And The Tramp and that was a direct stream."
"Bad CGIThe CGI was disappointing. I didn't like Flounder at all. Sebastian was ok. Not great. Bailey can sing but in some scenes, she looked too old. The carriage scenes were ok. She looked like a 16 yo girl. But other scenes she looked like a 22 yo woman. I didn't like that. Also, a lot of her expressions when looking at CGI characters were vacuous. It's like she was unable to interact with the right location. I don't know. It could have been much better. Also, it was much too long. I saw a lot of kids under ten wondering around and looking at everything but the movie. Ursula was good. The new songs were just so so. I like the live action films, but this was disappointing. Maybe it was because there was so much hype that it couldn't help but to let me down. I expected much better."
"MehMediocre at best, most of the live actions in my opinion have kind of sucked, hard to get animal facial expressions when it's supposed to be alive.

Since it's cgi I feel like it needs to have a semi real face for the character, this way the animals can show emotion instead of this weird look they get when the animators try to show human range of motion just with the eye brows.

Also, some characters were also missing, won't get into to much but a couple of characters that maybe did not have a huge impact on the story but still memorable were cut out and I def did not like that either.

Either make a complete remake or stay true to the original material. No 50/50."
"DISREGARD EVERY NEGATIVE COMMENT/REVIEW YOU COME ACROSS!!""The Little Mermaid"" starring Halle Bailey was BRILLIANT!! 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽

To the ""movie critics"" and whomever else is speaking bad about the movie went into the movie NOT wanting to like it, and got exactly that, because I couldn't find a single thing wrong with it. From the casting, the visuals, the storyline, and the message of it all was brilliantly done! 🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽

Like, I'm SUPER impressed and overwhelmed with how magnificent the movie turned out.

If you haven't gone to see the movie yet, I HIGHLY recommend you do so. You won't be disappointed. I assure you. This movie is a great watch for ANYONE!"
"Rob Marshall's ""The Little Mermaid"" was enjoyable.If you go into ""The Little Mermaid"" without much memory of the original film, you will probably enjoy this film. I'd forget about the original while watching, because this movie doesn't come close. The new version of ""The Little Mermaid"" includes brand new elements/moments while it also completely takes away iconic elements/moments from the original.

Halle Bailey shines as Ariel. The chemistry is felt between Ariel and the prince. The most enjoyable parts of the movie were when these two were on screen. Some of their scenes suffered from emotionless dialogue.

Sebastian's character was unenjoyable. Flounder's voice actor gave an enjoyable performance despite the awkward-to-look-at CGI. Scuttle's character had laugh out moments, but the new song felt unnecessary.

Ursula fell flat. Melissa Mccarthy gave a forgettable performance. The attempted comedic elements were again unnecessary. The CGI really was bad, especially with Ursula. Javier Bardem's performance was again flat. He showed very little emotion that was desperately needed to make his scenes work.

The new lore and elements added to the film were interesting, but felt rushed/unfleshed.

Rob Marshall's ""The Little Mermaid"" was overall enjoyable, due to Halle Bailey's stand out performance as Ariel and an attempt at a deeper story. The film is unfortunately brought down by its many flaws that are hard to ignore."
"Disney's Live-Action Remake Has Everything But Lacks The Most Important Thing - CharmThe Little Mermaid (2023) : Movie Review -

Rob Marshall brings the live-action adaptation of Disney's popular animated fantasy, ""The Little Mermaid,"" with Halle Bailey. I wasn't quite sure that Disney couldn't have found a better name than Marshall for a live-action version of Ariel's Oceanic love story-but alas... I wish I was right. Even I had certain expectations from the filmmaker-especially when you know what story he has to offer. The Little Mermaid has everything done right-from redeveloping every single character to dialogue and music-but has gone wrong with one thing - the Charm! And it hurts, man. How can one look at this Ariel, an almond-skinned girl, after having seen the super gorgeous and milky-white Ariel in the animated drama? Where is the charm? Where is that attractive face you were looking for? Maybe they shouldn't have chosen this animated flick for a remake since live-action effects are totally nonfunctional.

The story, as we all know, follows a mermaid named Ariel (Halle Bailey), who is the youngest daughter of Atlantica's ruler, King Triton (Javier Bardem). She is popular in the ocean for her melodious voice and loves singing. She is curious about the human world and wants to know more by visiting the surface. Her fascination is forbidden by her father, Triton-not just her, but all the mermaids. During her secret visit to the surface, she saves Prince Eric (Jonah Hauer-King) from a shipwreck and falls in love with him. Ariel becomes determined to be with him in the world above water. These actions lead to a confrontation with her father and an encounter with the conniving sea witch Ursula (Melissa McCarthy). Ursula, who has always been good at conning and making trades, plans to trap Ariel so that she can take over the trident of Triton. Ariel makes a deal with her to trade her beautiful voice for human legs so she can discover the world above water and impress Eric. However, this ultimately places her life (and her father's crown) in jeopardy. Will Ariel find his love as Ursula continues with her devious plans?

As far as I can see, there are no additional changes made to the script or the screenplay. However, it's a pretty long and stretched narrative. I don't see how they can think of dilating this standard 90-minute trip to 135 minutes when there's nothing more to explore except the physical properties on the surface and under water. The Little Mermaid is a sweet little story, so keep it sweet and little. Why drag it out unnecessarily? The first half literally puts you to sleep. Then, we have an engaging second half with some action, explosions, and high VFX frames. Things have been pretty interesting and watchable in the last 30 minutes, so yes, I can say that the mermaid survives on the shore. The comedy doesn't work as the dialogues arr copied from the 80s flick, which is indeed outdated now. From ""You are just the crab to do it,"" to ""How much I'm gonna miss my daughter,"" the sentences are not quite right. Or is it the impact of the original flick? I'm afraid so.

One thing you can excel at with live-action remakes is the acting, as you get real actors in front of the camera. The Little Mermaid surpasses the original one there, because the animation is highly dependent on computer generated expressions, while live-action remakes can bring a real human feel. Halle Bailey is a dull princess, if I have to judge by her looks. But yes, her performance is pretty good. Jonah Hauer-King's Eric isn't as handsome as the animated Eric, but he certainly gave better expressions. King Triton looked like a real handsome king in the 1989 flick, but here Javier Bardem wasn't that pretty. The get-up, the costume-it just didn't fit right. Ursula was best portrayed in the animation frames because the structure was wild, crazy, and obscenely beautiful. Here, you can't expect Melissa McCarthy to do so. There is something terribly wrong with the visualisation of The Little Mermaid's world, but I can't blame anyone for that as the feature film formats aren't comparable. Melissa still did a decent job. Noma Dumezweni, Jacob Tremblay (voice), Awkwafina (voice), Daveed Diggs (voice), Jessica Alexander (even more gorgeous than Ariel), John Dagleish, and Martina Laird are okayish.

The Little Mermaid is uplifted by its VFX team, which had the challenge of creating two different worlds completely opposite each other. Nothing can ever match the pleasure of watching the dark blue ocean in the animation world. This mild blue water is no match for it, by far. Like I said, the animation world was too beautiful to be matched by the real-life features, and that's the biggest fault here. Be it Ariel, Triton, Ursula, Eric, Crab, and others, you just can't feel the way you felt the original characters 4 decades ago. The cinematography and sound design contribute a bit to the overall experience, but the editing is below par. I am not a huge Rob Marshall fan, as I never understood the hype for Chicago (the humour worked, the film didn't) and Mary Poppins Returns (not even half of the original), while Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides was saved by Johnny Depp's unbeatable Jack Sparrow. With The Little Mermaid, he exposed his shortcomings again, despite having a full-proof script (that wasn't the case with his other known works). So, The Little Mermaid is passably watchable only because of the visual effects, old musical numbers (one of the biggest pluses here), and the popular fantasy tale. Skip it or watch it; it deserves both. It might fit in your social media world if you don't watch films made in the past, but for (someone like) me, it's definitely not gonna be part of my world.

RATING - 5/10*"

Animated winsCome-on Disney. The cartoon was way better. What happened to the Disney magic? Special effects didn't live up to anticipation or realism... Haley Barry is pretty good.... Not sure how much I liked the rest of the cast... Over all I'm left disappointed in the overall movie and should have waited for the TV version to hit. The theater reaction from others were fairly similar to mine.... I think there will be a lot of people who only see this once... Maybe knowing the story line having seen the original didn't help when watching this version... It doesn't compare to the 1980s/90s cartoon animation.
"""THE LITTLE MERMAID"" REVIEWDirected by Rob Marshall. A runtime of two hours and fifteen minutes. With a PG rating.

This is the live-action remake of one of Disney's highest acclaimed films ""The Little Mermaid"". Starring Halle Bailey as ""Ariel"". This is ""King Triton"" played by Javier Bardem the king of the seas and father to the most stubborn daughter in the ocean.

""Ariel"" even though told many times to stay away from the surface has an infatuation with humans and the surface world.

No matter if it's her father, her best friend ""Flounder"" played by Jacob Tremblay, her overseer ""Sebastian"" played by Daveed Diggs, or her land friend ""Scuttle"" played by Awkwafina nothing can seem to pry ""Ariel"" away from her curiosity of the surface world.

But ""Ariel"" none the wiser doesn't realize her aunt ""Ursula"" played by Melissa McCarthy is plotting on her every move. Things only get worse or better depending on who you ask. When ""Prince Eric"" played by Jonah Hauer-King nearly died at sea. ""Ariel"" saved his life further intensifying her surface world curiosity.

Like ""Ariel"" ""Eric"" has a controlling parent as well, ""The Queen"" played by Noma Dumezweni. He also has a handler ""Sir Grimsby"" played by Art Malik who's like ""Sebastian"". Works for royalty and Is supposed to be harsher on their kids. But clearly, that doesn't take place because they have a soft spot for them.

Regardless of both parents trying to stop them from interacting with each other's world. It's inevitable. ""Ursula"" takes advantage of this posing a sneaky deal. ""Ariel"" can ditch the tail and get legs experiencing the surface world for three days. The only catch is she will have no voice. But even simple deals come with a catch. Always be mindful of the disclaimer. Read the small print at the bottom.

Will ""Ariel"" enjoy her three days above water or will she be forced to deal with ""Ursula's"" shenanigans? In this live-action remake.

""The Little Mermaid"" was the best live-action remake to be made. Halle Bailey is a perfect ""Ariel"". She is a true Disney princess. She embodies ""Ariel"" on and off the big screen. Her voice was magical. Halle had adults and children crying from joy.

They changed some things from the original script. I liked that they dived into the storyline a little more. Everything they changed or put emphasis on made sense. It went along with the storyline. I did miss ""Lee Poissons"" though.

There was nothing I hated. Just a few things I might have tweaked. Like the ending, it dragged on a little. I expected Daveed Diggs Jamaican accent to be bad but I've heard way worse. In the flow of the film it sounded fine. But overall they knocked this film out of the park. The script, casting, and I can't forget the visuals. It was spectacular.

As an adult I was impressed. I know any kid watching this will feel immersed in Disney magic. I can't give Halle Bailey enough credit. I also can't finish this without acknowledging the film's inclusivity. Showing all those ethnicities was awesome. Please go out and enjoy this amazing film. The bar is set and High I might add. I give this film five more fires 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥.

"Did not make it to the endThere's only one word that describes this movie.... STINKER!!! This was one of those films you walk out angry, because it's time you won't ever get back. The only positive I can give this film was the young lady playing the lead role was absolutely gorgeous. Oh and the crab was indeed funny.... The remake's main sin, however, is that it's visually confusing, if not altogether aesthetically unappealing. At times, it looks downright awful. If you blame the movie on the lead actress THEN YOU ALREADY DECIDED before watching, this movie stinks because of the individuals who made the film. What a shame because I wanted to like it!!!! You're better off going to see Mario Brothers for 2nd or 3rd time, and wait for Disney to release for free on their app, BUT I won't waste another second on this movie, wasn't worth the first watch, much less a 2nd."
"Just... noVery altered from the original Disney movie and very bad cgi. Many differences and weird characters. No words. My friend's twin daughters that were excited since last year to see it, they were very disappointed and kept calling ""When the real Ariel will show up?"" and me and my friend sunk in our movie theater chairs not knowing what we have to say to the girls. Eventually we told them after we finished the movie and went for ice cream and they got very sad. I don't have any problem with Bailey, she was good, but the kids? They are kids... Its was like they told them they were adopted. They had that face."
"Delightful and EnjoyableNow that I've watched The Little Mermaid I have quite a lot to say about the movie. Let's start off with

THE POSITIVES

THE CAST- The casting for The Little Mermaid couldn't have been more perfect. Halle Bailey's breathtaking performance as Ariel is hands down the greatest aspect of the movie. Her singing, her charm and her line delivery is almost identical to Jodi Benson's Ariel while adding a little bit of her own style to the character. Mellisa McCarthy as Ursula is deliciously evil and her rendition of Poor Unfortunate Souls freaking slaps. Jonah-Hauer King does a pretty great job as Prince Eric. He really brings out the character's adventure spirit. And Daveed Diggs as Sabastian and Awkwafina as Scuttle provide solid comedic relief.

THE SONGS- The movie features almost all the songs from the first movie with the exception of Les Poisson and Daughters of Triton which were sadly cut from the movie. Halle Bailey's rendition of Part Of Your World gives you literal chills. Every line she delivers brings out her desperation and longing for the human world. Mellisa McCarthy, like I said, knocks it out of the park with her rendition of Poor Unfortunate Souls which brings out the devilish personality of this character. Under The Sea is a BOP as always. On top of that there are three new songs written by Lin Manuel Miranda which are all good songs ( except for one, we'll get to that later.)

THE CHEMISTRY- One of the things that I liked about the movie is the chemistry between our two leads. Their relationship here feels a little more fleshed out than in the original. We get to see them bonding over time as they both seek the passion for adventure.

PRINCE ERIC- I feel like the filmmakers did a justice to Prince Eric. They made him more fleshed out than in the original giving him a backstory and a song. We get to see more of him and his passion this time around.

THE VFX- Okay. So the trailers and the TV spots for this movie were absolutely terrible and I was a lot more worried about the VFX while going into this movie. But boy was I proven wrong. The VFX, even if not as amazing as it could've been, is beautiful to look at. The underwater world looks so colorful and vibrant that it creates an immersive experience for the audience.

THE NEGATIVES-

THE SCUTTLEBUTT- As much as I love the songs in the movie this one song was easily the worst aspect of it. It feels so forced and unnecessary and is really annoying. IDK how Lin Manuel thought a rap for Sabastian and Scuttle would be a cool idea.

THE PACING- It pretty much follows the plot of the original movie but adds some of its own story which ends up feeling a little rushed and overstuffed. The second act felt a little uneven at times but thankfully the climax saves it all.

FINAL VERDICT-

The Little Mermaid is one of the better live action adaptations from Disney that pretty much retains the heart and soul of the story we know and love. It's not perfect and definitely has it's issues but it's a beautiful and charming movie nonetheless which comes close to recapturing the magic of the animated original. 7.8/10."

"Not very goodI went in with an open mind, willing to give this movie a chance, despite what others say. It was really awful. It just looked bizarre and had awful singing sequences. I am not sure why they feel the need to continually make cartoons into live action movies, but this is another that should not have been done. The cartoon is far superior and if you want to see a good version of this, stick wth that one. Even when they had this story on Once Upon a Time (the tv show) was far better than this mess. If you insist, you are better off waiting until it hits cable or a streaming channel you already have than wasting money on it."

"Really?I don't know why they made this movie, Disney couldn't write a new character and tried to revive this with terrible CGI designs. The acting was good the singing was great but it just wasn't the same. It didnt feel right throughout the whole movie Disney should be sued for monopolizing and all the rights to their characters should be redistributed to people who care for the stories and movies. All Disney cares about is marketing and money. Perhaps if they didn't milk old characters as much as they could they'd come up with new stories. Disney and their employee's are what's wrong with this world no magination or passion just greed."
"Better than the OriginalLet's face it, the original little mermaid was kinda bad. The animation was kinda old and the music wasn't very well produced. The story didn't make much sense either

this new one is so much better, the music is fantastic and th cast was really well put together. Cinematically a total gem. Lin Manuel again stamps his legendary touch in Disney. He may go down as the most important thing to happen to Disney since Jon Favreau. It's probably the best live action remake of a disney classic ever. And way funnier than the orginal and less of the classic Disney princess tropes that don't fit 2023 sensibilities ."

"Utterly devoid of charmIt's really hard to find any redeeming qualities with The Little Mermaid. The acting is bland, the CGI is dark and without charm and it's horrendously boring. My daughter of 9 was yawing and asking to go to McDonalds after 60 minutes. I explained to her that we're only half way through and her face sank. It's a testing time when a child that loved the original feels like the remake is too long and boring. I thought it was just so pointless. The original is one of the finest animated films ever and this is an over long cash grab. None of it makes sense. Ariel doesn't have red hair. A bird can breath underwater. Eric doesn't save the day which negates the redemption with Triton. I would recommend that everybody watch the original or read Hans Christian Andersen's story. This horrible CGI version is not worth your money."

"2023 - Movie of the year!Halle Bailey is the perfect Ariel and effortlessly perfected every inch of this role, her body language, emotion and energy throughout the movie captivates you, more than any character in the movie and you truly believe that she is capable of everything she puts her mind too, going against the norm and standing up to her fathers need for control.

Her beauty, truly allows her to portray the ellegance of a mermaid and her siren vocals are spectacular and worth replaying time and time again!

Melissa McCarthy also deserves to be at the forefront of appraisal for her extraordinary performance and powerful vocals!

Definitely the best movie I have seen in 2023 and think it will remain a new fan-favourite live action by Disney for years to come!"
"Too looongVery nice visual effects, definitely well done! Nice footage, the director of photography did a GREAT job! My wife enjoyed one song in particular a lot. We laughed on several occasions! The movie has some very nice and lovely parts but unfortunately there has some pretty boring as well. There were moments that if someone would have asked me to to go get some popcorn or a drink, I would have said ""not now"" because I didn't want to miss what was happening, but there were times where I would not mind leaving at all. Kind of violent and too long for small children. My grandkids were almost falling asleep."
"Meh. Not for me.This movie was not my cup of tea. It was dull, the characters had very little depth and it dragged at times. The lead actress was good, but other than that, I didn't really find much to like. The length of the movie was a bit long for me. I found the animation to be odd, especially the Flounder character. I was hoping for some new twists in the story, but it was basically a rehash of the original, which I much preferred . I suppose I was hoping for another big hit, but it just didn't work for me. Maybe if they added some new characters or something that could have done it, but they didn't have much. Not for me."
"Loved it! So well cast!I don't understand the low ratings! I loved everything about it! Halle was amazing (acting and singing), and I admit her rendition of Part of your world gave me goosebumps and yes....... I cried :) Bardem is exactly how I would have imagined the king (he could be cast as Neptune as well :) ) Daveed Diggs and Awquafina were hilarious! Melissa McCarthy was good, but not evil enough (at least, not for me) :) The scenes undersea were rich in every sense: the colours, the creativity with the costumes and the characters, the choreography,.......! And finally the songs and the score........ amazing!! I'm sure it will be nominated for Oscars."
"Another live-action remake that doesn't quite live up to the original.Let me start off by saying I was impatiently awaiting this movies' arrival. I bought my tickets 1 week in advance and was ready! However, during the film I nearly feel asleep half way through as did the other guests who attended with me. Not to say that this is a bad movie, it just doesn't hold as much magic as the original does and it is not nearly as captivating. It felt that the new elements and songs that were added took up a lot of time and then the parts that I was waiting for felt rushed. For instance, Vanessa's arrival and the ceremony that follows felt like they lasted only 5 minutes and there was no big pay off and I felt the same with Ursula's final scene.

I thought that Hallie and Melissa did a good job. I believe my favorite characters were the side characters such as Flounder, Sebastian, and even Scuttle (they should think about removing the rap from the DVD).

Maybe that's an impossible expectation to compare it the original? Seeing as I personally feel that non of the Disney remakes have added any substance or reason for needing a remake. But when taking the original out of the equation it is an overall decent film."
"Bland, not iconic, nothingI really don't like this ""live action remake"" and let me explain myself.

Firstly, the most iconic things which I had in mind connected to the little mermaid as red hairs, bubbles or even excellent sea creatures were hardly ommited. Instead of that we get brownish hair, not really magic sea world and weirdly annimated things... Secondly, the show itself is not adding anything new or fresh or even worth to rewatching it. I really waited for some enhancements due to high budget and technological advance but I was left with nothing.

So we got a poor remake which was supposed to be something spectacular but turned out to be as bland as the sand on the beach."

"Maybe not for the younger girls...My daughter is 6.5 and she found it incredibly boring. By an hour in she had asked me several times if we could leave, so we did. Honestly, I felt the same about the original when I was her age. I was hoping they had made improvements. It looked beautiful, sounded beautiful but moves so slowly. I do like that they gave Prince Eric a background and personality, but it wasn't enough to hold her attention. Or too subtle for her to understand the connection between them. I will try watching again when it streams on Disney+ but for now, we are a little disappointed that we wasted our money on this."
"Terrible movieTerrible movie. The fishes were scary and weird. The actress had zero salt. Everything else was empty. They had one of the classics on their hand and they butchered it. The male dude was so empty and blank that makes you wonder why would she leave everything behind for such an empty vessel? Just bad movie overall. They had incredible live actions like the lion king and maleficente, but they also had terrible ones. This one goes to the bottom of the line as the worst one I have seem so far. And I have seem some terrible ones like dumbo..... I feel like they just wanted a live action and nothing more. No depth..."
"Should have left it at animated versionLong, draggy, poorly conceived, and sun-par acting make this one tedious ordeal. The music, for the most part, will provide small pockets of relief, but it's bad when you keep looking at your watch every 10-15 minutes to see how long you've been enduring a movie. The CGI and rendering was so amateurish, I was actually shocked at the poor quality. I had no problem making minor plot changes, but the story overall was fractured. Melissa McCarthy stole the scenes she was in, and I'm grateful she tried so hard. The rest of the performances feel dialed-in or High School drama club quality. Was really hoping to enjoy it, but was so happy when it ended. Very disappointing considering this has the potential to a massive success."
"I didn't expect to like it but I made a big mistakeThe enchanting tale of ""The Little Mermaid"" has captivated audiences for generations, and the recent remake breathes new life into this beloved story while staying true to its original magic. With a fresh perspective and stunning visuals, the remake transforms the classic into a modern epic that keeps the essence of the original intact.

From the very first scene, it's evident that no expense was spared in creating a visually mesmerizing world under the sea. The underwater kingdom of Atlantica comes alive in vibrant colors, intricate details, and breathtaking CGI that transports viewers into an awe-inspiring underwater realm. The stunning imagery serves as a testament to the advancements in filmmaking, enhancing the original story's enchantment and captivating the audience at every turn.

One of the most remarkable aspects of this remake is how faithfully it stays true to the original story and characters. While there are subtle updates and modern touches, the film successfully preserves the heart and soul of the original Disney classic. The beloved characters, such as Ariel, Flounder, and Sebastian, are beautifully brought to life, capturing their essence and endearing qualities while adding new layers of depth to their personalities. The screenplay, written with care, ensures that the spirit of the original remains intact, instilling nostalgia in long-time fans while delighting new audiences.

The cast of the remake deserves accolades for their performances, bringing a new level of depth and emotion to their characters. The talented actors breathe life into the roles they portray, with each member of the ensemble shining in their own unique way. The casting of the lead character, Ariel, showcases the exceptional talent of the actress who effortlessly embodies the iconic mermaid, evoking both vulnerability and strength. The chemistry between the cast members is palpable, creating a harmonious ensemble that truly brings the story to life.

While ""The Little Mermaid"" remake excelled in many aspects, there were a couple of minor disappointments that stood out. One of them was the portrayal of Flounder, Ariel's loyal companion. In the original film, Flounder was endearing and instantly lovable, but in the remake, his character fell somewhat short of capturing that same charm. Though still a faithful friend to Ariel, his portrayal lacked the same level of sweetness and innocence that made the original Flounder so memorable. It would have been wonderful to see the remake delve deeper into his character and evoke the same fondness as the original.

Additionally, fans of the original might have noticed the absence of a memorable scene in the castle where Sebastian, the charismatic crab, finds himself hilariously pursued by the relentless chef. This comical interlude brought lightheartedness and laughter to the original film, and its omission in the remake left a void in terms of pure comedic relief. While the absence of this scene didn't detract significantly from the overall enjoyment of the film, its inclusion would have been a delightful homage to the original and added an extra layer of entertainment."
"It was ok...The movie was ok...

The plot line was as expected. It didn't differ much from the original ""Little Mermaid"". So that part was good.

The acting was great. I think the cast was very suited for their roles. Halle Bailey played Ariel beautifully and I loved Melissa McCarthy as Ursula. Jonah Hauer-King as Eric was also a good choice.

What I found really down-graded this re-make from the original was the music. Aside from the ""Part of your World"", which I think Halle Bailey sung beautifully, a lot of the music was irritating. Particularly the ""Scuttlebutt"" song.

Also, the live action remake made the animal characters seem lifeless and dead-pan because they don't have facial expressions like they did in the OG cartoon version which sort of killed the magic.

Overall, it just seemed sort of unnecessary to make a re-make of the original in the first place."
"Familiar, but just not very goodI don't know why Disney continues to try to do live action remakes. They just don't work. This movie is no exception. Perhaps a second story, showing a new mermaids adventures would have been more appropriate than trying to remake the old. The CGI animals were weird, which is surprising because you'd want merchandise to sell. No one will want merch from this version. The rap song was odd, it just didn't fit the movie. Plenty of people looked really bored in the theater. It's one of those movies that just keeps going and going and going. If this is any indication of Disney's future, it's in trouble. Let's hope for new stories, not old."
"Great live action remakeThe lovely actress who played Ariel was wonderful. She has an incredible voice and somehow stayed pretty true to the original songs, but still made it her own in a few ways.

Wasn't a super fan of the new songs. It's like they felt they needed something to make the movie longer and that was good filler. But they were meh.

Loved how King Trident's daughters were from all races, truly representing the 7 seas, as mentioned.

The underwater scenes were very visually stunning and I enjoyed the village scenes as well. Loved the cameo from the OG Ariel there.

Overall, great live action adaptation and will probably purchase this when it comes out for my daughter."

"I really wanted to love this move - but sadly I didn't.I want to preface this by saying that I truly wanted to love this movie. We'd looked forward to it and booked early as my kids and I are huge Little Mermaid fans, but this just wasn't it, I'm afraid.

On the plus side, Halle Bailey has an incredible voice and acted beautifully throughout. The costumes were mostly wonderful and some of the visuals were brilliant (more on that later). There were some good laughs and I liked the inclusion of Eric's mother as a new character. Max the dog is very cute and we all loved the scenes with him!

Some of the visuals were amazing, particularly the scenes on land but the under water stuff was really dark, dull and hard to see. Some of the songs were bizarre. It felt like the words were forced rather than actually fitting the music, and the actors seemed to struggle to keep up at times due to this. The storyline wasn't as expected, it felt forced, unnecessarily dragged out and the plot was perhaps too different in places. We also weren't fans of Flounder, Sebastian and Ursula - I was surprised at how little effort seemed to have gone into these characters, Ursula in particular was a real disappointment (I love Melissa McCarthy too). Ariel's friends seemed unnecessary inclusions and we're verging on being a little cringe. But what hurt the most was how annoying the character of Scuttle was! By the second half I was grinding my teeth at every appearance of him. Him being my favourite character in the original, that was a hard pill to swallow.

All in all, sadly it just seemed to be missing something and lacking in that Disney magic we've all come to expect. Of the 5 kids we took (aged between 8 and 14), 2 wanted to leave early and the other 3 said ""it was ok, but not brilliant"". I'm glad we saw it, but it's not one we'd watch again and again like other Disney movies and remakes. I'd be surprised if any of us watched it again. It's a real shame as I was so hoping they'd prove the naysayers wrong."

"Nice film quick kids lovedThis is pretty much as expected. It's a live version of the Little Mermaid. It's not perfect - I thought the special effects weren't good - but it's entertaining and joyful. The lead has a great voice, McCathy is sufficiently menacing for a Disney villain and the music is lively and lovely. The young children in the cinema with me loved it and were dancing away throughout the film.

I definitely would prefer original films rather than all these live action remakes but this film is just what it claims to be - a live action version of the animation. The casting is good and the new songs worked well. Definitely a good choice for Disney loving kids."

"2 hours and 15 of awful CGI....This was a huge disappointment. I was expecting so much better from Disney and hoping this wasn't going to fail like so many other live action remakes and this was my favorite when I was little. I really think Disney needs to stop ruining classic movies that are already established and think of new fresh ideas. I feel like they have lost imagination and their magic, which is why I love Disney in the first place. My 10 year old keep saying this isn't how the movie goes, this is wrong and during the unnecessary extra scenes that went on for what seemed like forever she fell asleep. It was boring. They removed lyrics from Poor Unfortunate Souls and Under The Sea that won 3 awards when it was released in 1989. It's so dark, flat and dull looking, like they used free stock footage. I really wanted to love it but it wasn't good at all. Save your money and go see Dreamworks brand new Teen Kraken in 30 days."
"Disney Best live Action Remake yetThroughout a stupidly controversial process Disney has made the best live action remake yet. One that may even be better than the original. The films changes gives a new light on each character. A story of each characters hardships that will be overcame with the power of love

when I first heard of the little mermaid being developed was not really worried because I loved all of the live action version's (except mulan unfortunately). Although when I went to see the movie in the weekend (05-27-23) I didn't expect it to literally blow me out of the water (heh ocean jokes). This has quite possibly become my favorite live action remake."
"Mid movie, Halle Bailey was amazing thoughIt's clear to see why she was hired on the spot, her voice sounds ethereal. My main complaints are with the way Flounder looks/ some of the animation because literally what is that?? The reason the original movie is so good is because of the cartoonish animation - which they obviously can't do here BUT Sebastian wasn't as horrifying to look at as Flounder was, they made the eyes slightly more animated looking. Another place they missed the mark: king Triton. He wasn't a good actor, all the scenes with him felt so forced and uncomfortable.

The actor who played Vanessa should have gotten more screen time, she was absolutely amazing and did a great job on her role."
"My Grandchildren Hated ItMy grandchildren hated it. Any movie advertised as for children that makes my granddaughter scream in terror gets a 1 in my book. I think that with all the too lifelike scenes that she did not understood at all that all the violence on screen wasn't real. I would really hesitate on taking little tykes. The older ones were bored and said they would have rather stayed home and watched Toonami. At the price of those tickets, I really wish they had too.

The movie was dark and soulless. It lacked the over the top expression and bright colors of animation yet it also lacked the sparkle and subtlety that a real human actor can give a scene. I found the angelfish thing they called Flounder quite ugly and there was no way I would have even. I would never have guessed that thing was Sebastian. It looked like a lobster to me.

The music was soulless by comparison. Halle Bailey could belt a tune but the arrangement was bad. I really, really hated that the rap number. That just so didn't fit.

The movie also felt padded out and sluggish, with not good pacing."
"SuperbI wasn't sure what to expect going into this but ended up being completely impressed! I saw it in 3D and it was so spectacular I had to go back and see it in 3D a second time. I haven't been a fan of Disney's live action renditions in the past, so I was pleasantly surprised with this one.

The visuals were phenomenal and the story stayed true to the original while still putting a new spin on things. Bailey's singing was beyond beautiful and her sweet nature struck the character on the mark. McCarthy absolutely knocked it out of the park as well. The new songs were great. Definitely recommended."
"It is decent for a live action remakeI'm not really a big fan of live action remakes, or just live action in general, but this movie was actually pretty good. I didn't really like the designs for Sebastian, Flounder, and Scuttle at first but I got used to it. I'd say the first half of it was boring and colorless, but once Sebastian started singing ""Under the Sea"" the colors were great. I don't know why they made Scuttle a girl, but I'm a fan of the voice actress so I guess I can't complain. So in my opinion, it's a pretty great movie, better than most live actions. I'll give it an 7/10 for keeping me entertained enough to stay awake."
"Wrost disney movie everThis movie is too It's unreasonable, and the changes compared to the original version are very abrupt. Seriously ruins the viewing experience.

I was looking forward to this movie very much at first, but after actually watching it, I found that it is far inferior to the original version. The moving parts of the original version have completely disappeared, replaced by a really abrupt and blunt preaching plot, which makes people unable to focus on it. The movie itself.

The Little Mermaid itself is beautiful in the movie, but the rest of the movie ruins the whole beauty. It can be said that the director completely ruined the movie."
"Don't believe the criticsThe movie is very good. It's a shame it's so criticized. In the end, there is sensitivity, love, songs, hope. These values probably don't resonate with many who write reviews here and then they decide to blame the movie, the actors, etc. It's a 10 movie. I even cried many times because of the characters. Everything is so beautiful, magical. I am very sorry that is not being understood by everyone and that some people decided to criticize a film that should have been more appreciated, more valued, with better reviews. I hope that more films like this will be made in the future because they are special in every way."
"Not half bad.HEADS UP! I have not seen the original The Little Mermaid in forever. I only listen to Poor Unfortunate Souls a lot.

So to be quick: It's good. Granted, I like a lot of the live-action remakes, but I thought this film was good.

To get the flaws out of the way first, the CGI looks pretty bad. Namely Triton looked fake as heck every time he was on screen, Flounder looked off, Ursulas tentacles always felt like a separate part of her, and the final fight looked like a video game. Also the pacing of the film was strange. The beginning felt a bit rushed, and everything after that felt very slow. Flounder served no purpose to the story, and the new songs were only okay, the Scuttlebutt rap being particularly questionable quality-wise. The music itself feels forced, and with the exception of Poor Unfortunate Souls, none of them left an impression.

But in terms of positives, the good outweighs the bad. The performances are great across the board. Halle Bailey disappears into the role of Ariel, and Mellisa McCarthy is fantastic as Ursula. The guy who plays the prince is good, and Daveed Diggs is really good as Sebastian. I never would have guessed it was him. This film also had some pretty good jokes, namely from Scuttlebutt. However, I just like Awkwafina's style of humor, so if you don't get into it, this won't change your mind. And while the film has a slow pace, I like how they developed Erik, including him and Ariel's relationship.

So yeah, pretty good movie. I recommend.

Side note, did anyone think that Ursula's human form looked like Hailee Steinfield? Or is that just me?"
"Worse than seafood poisoningFirst off, the CGI in this movie is an absolute joke. I mean, seriously, did they hire a bunch of amateurs to do the visual effects? The underwater scenes look like they were lifted straight out of a bad video game from the '90s. It's laughable! 🎮😂 The mermaids and other sea creatures look so fake and poorly rendered that it's hard to suspend disbelief and get lost in the story.

And speaking of the story, let's talk about those songs. They sucked, plain and simple. The original animated film had such memorable and catchy tunes, but this remake just falls flat. The new versions lack the charm and magic of the originals, and the singers seem to struggle to hit the right notes. It's a cringeworthy musical experience. 🎶😫

Now, let's move on to Ursula, the iconic villain. In the animated version, she was fierce, powerful, and captivating. But in this live-action mess, she's nothing more than a caricature. The portrayal lacks depth and fails to capture the essence of the character. It's a disservice to the incredible performance of the original Ursula. 👑😡

And let's not forget the unnecessary addition of CGI animals throughout the film. It feels like Disney was just trying to cram as much CGI as possible to distract from the lackluster storytelling and performances. The animals are poorly integrated and look so out of place that it's hard to take the movie seriously. 🐠🦀

To sum it all up, this live-action remake of The Little Mermaid is a prime example of how Disney's obsession with rehashing their classics has gone too far. Each remake seems to be worse than the previous one, and it's clear that no one asked for this. It's a soulless cash grab that tarnishes the legacy of the original film. Disney, please, for the love of all that is good, stop with the live-action remakes! 🚫😤"

"A great SurpriseI personally didn't expect much from the movie. At best an exact copy of the animated movie without that magic However, it wasn't I will not deny that they removed several things unnecessarily, but, They also added elements that enriched the story, such as the father-daughter dynamic between Ariel and Triton... Or the dynamic between Ariel and Eric, you really see a person forming and with that chemistry Speaking of the bad thing about the movie, it would be Úrsula and the animals, that is, the latter have no expression, and Úrsula was too flat a character All in all it was a good movie !!!!!!"
"Laziness is ObviousHalle Bailey and Melissa McCarthy were definitely the best part of the movie because everything else was lazy work. 2 outfits the entire movie, neither of which were phenomenal. Cringeworthy songs that were absolutely unnecessary.

Underwhelming performance of Under the Sea compared to the original. Lazy visuals and CGI. Some saving moments by extending the romance, but at the expense of cutting out more moments from the sisters who seemed to have important roles but then weren't given any more screentime. Multiple cut songs from the original movie including Les Poissons.

Horrendous voice acting from Sebastian, Flounder, and Scuttle.

The original charm of the movie is often lost in the remake through obviousl short cuts and unnecessarily extending the movie by an hour."
"1St one was far betterMy wife really wanted to see this film in the theater. Meh, overall for me. She like it a bit more, but neither of us could wait till it was over. Boring, very boring. The cast was lacking and everything seemed off, just a bit. Just empty. Did not care for the music or the songs. Halle can sing, wish they had created better music and songs for her. The rap music was not fitting a movie like this at all. For the kind of money spent on this movie, one would have thought the animation and the animated characters would have been better. Sebastian, looks were completely off on him and it looked like about five minutes of work went into the making of him. I hope more will save their money or pick a better film."
"Must See for Me!I LOVED it!!

Five stars!

Disney did SUCH a great job with this one.

And giving a nod with the quote at the start to Hans Christian Andersen truly made my heart soar!

As a lifelong fan of The Little Mermaid, it was the FIRST film I remember seeing in theaters with my Father and family.

This was everything I could have ever asked for from one of my most beloved films; a film that inspired me from the tender age of 5 when it first came out - a film that showed that love overcomes all, imagination and faith can make anything possible and that anyone can become a part of the world they wish for with just a little effort, hope, and ambition.

Halle Bailey; you did such a great job bringing Ariel to life. Thank you for playing this role with such beautiful finesse and bringing one of my favorite princesses to life with perfect execution!"
"Not good but not as bad as I initially thought.After seeing Disney's first attempts at live actions, I'll admit I didn't have much faith in this movie and questioned if I should even watch it in the first place but after watching it what I have to say is.

I personally liked the graphics but will agree that the CGI models for Sebastian and Flounder are not pleasing to look at.


The songs were good but not as good as the original, I liked the songs they weren't bad but I feel like the original movie did so much for portraying the emotions of the characters with the tone of the voices were singing. Melissa McCarthy nailed Poor Unfortunate Souls, that is the one song that I feel reached that level.




Overall, 6/10 it was a decent film, it needed to work on a lot of things but wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. Melissa McCarthy nailed it, she was amazing."
"Disney does not disappointThis is a joke or something . The problem is NOT the color as many like to point out immediately when someone writes a bad review . The problem is that this does not work there is no soul . The only redemption is that Ariel can actually sing . But that is that . They should have made this an animated feature like Smurfs Lost Village or Super Mario . Ariel could be green for all I care .

The only Live Action remake Disney did and was actually good is ... as we all know it Maleficent . It was actually truly another take on the story that actually made it interesting / wonderful and also kind of sad .

Don't know why children would like to watch National Geographic Remakes of classic tale with live actors ..."
"Wonderful, faithful trip through the original!I went being highly skeptical, since I haven't liked most of the past Disney live action movies. There are times they take creative license and they think they can do better than the original, completely changing the story, and it becomes just watered-down fanfiction. But with this latest Little Mermaid live action movie, Disney hit a home run and absolutely bested themselves!

The visuals are stunning, the characters are all fun and enjoyable to watch and get to know, and most importantly, the music is a fantastic blast to hear!

Halle perfectly captures the musical essence of the original animated film and exceeded my expectations. I felt both connected and elevated by the passion she puts into her singing, and her acting was equally fun and enjoyable to watch. She is a treat with co-star Jonah as Eric, and their chemistry is electric.

Yes, this take on The Little Mermaid plays it a bit safe by sticking mostly with the original story. But that's what's so good about it! It didn't try to excessively subvert my expectations or push a moral narrative beyond what the original really did. It stuck to the classic's guns and sprinkled in some extra new fun in the form of new songs and some really funny sidekick humor.

Altogether, The Little Mermaid is a wonderful family-friendly trip through this timeless story about a father and daughter making new waves in the world. I went in expecting the worst, but now I cannot wait to see it again!"
"Good movie but too much fillerThe movie was all right. I believe there was too much filler Halle Bailey did play well as carrying the role of Ariel, as well as Melissa McCarthy as Ursula I wish that it did follow more the original story and did not correlate enough with the cartoon version. I do also wish they added scenes from the original such as the dining room scene where she is playing with her hair and the fork, as well as the scene with the Chef and Sebastian. The movie had way too much filler and it was way too long and it also didn't really make sense, as in remembering the cartoon version, I do enjoy the cinematography of it and also I enjoyed the visuals of the aquatic life and the different finishes and other sea creatures, and how vibrant the colors were. Overall, I did enjoy the movie but there was too much filler and I wish they would have stayed more to the original cartoon a little more."
"Just what I expectedI went in with low expectations and was not disappointed. TLM was my favorite Disney movie growing up and was so excited for a live action movie. This was not it. From the previews, it looked dark and gloomy. There was not enough color in most of the underwater scenes. What did they do to poor Flounder? No chemistry between Ariel and Erik. While Halle can sing well, she cannot act. She appears devoid of emotion in most scenes The songs are awful, especially Scuttlebutt. Who's idea was that?? The squawking hurt my ears! I could not take Javier Bardem seriously. I'd like to add that I love Vanessa."
"Weak and drawn-out, with bad CGIThis film is a weak, drawn-out imitation of the original. The lighting is bad, the CGI is sloppy (actors' heads pasted onto CGI bodies), and the new songs and dialogue feel uninspired. Melissa McCarthy is the one bright spot.

I went with a friend and her two kids. The kids are 5 and 7, and they were bored after about an hour. The movie's too long for small kids, though older kids might be OK.

Halle Bailey can sing but she can't act. I didn't see any chemistry between her and the Prince, which is terrible because their romance is a key part of the story. Awkwafina's a disaster. Triton and Sebastian are OK."

"A visually beautiful childhood remakeThe little mermaid live action is visually beautiful, you are immediately immersed in the ocean world, there are beautiful shot even made in the human world that suggests again the under the sea world. A very good cast, Halle Bailey voice is majestic! The film is a really good reminder of the original cartoon but I was a little surprised by the appearance of the character or Sebastian and Flounder. I feel this live action is not really destined for a too young audience, a tiny bit too long as most of them in the theatre have lost their attention by the middle of the movie. I suggest to watch the Little mermaid on an weekday evening to truly appreciate the movie as its deserved to be seen in cinema."
"The worst live action everTerrible acting , casting , songs , cgi. A terrible movie.

""The movie starts with a promising premise, but it quickly falls apart into a convoluted mess of clichés. The acting was mediocre at best, with wooden dialogue and one-dimensional characters that failed to engage me. The plot was riddled with inconsistencies and plot holes that made absolutely no sense. The special effects were poorly executed and looked cheap, which only added to the overall disappointment. I found myself checking my watch repeatedly, waiting for it to end. Unfortunately, even the ending was unsatisfying and left me wondering what I had just wasted my time on. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one."
"A Magical Underwater ExperienceThis live action version of The Little Mermaid (1989), which a lot consider to be one of Disney's greatest classics, truly carries a lot of heart. It's definitely not one of those unimaginative, dull live action remakes that reshoots everything scene-by-scene, word-for-word, that we've gotten in the past. This one is actually creative and fun The story's message of ambition, longing for adventure, and human connection - no matter how diverse - is featured strongly and effectively here. Halle truly breathes life into the iconic role of Ariel. She has the sweet, good-natured personality and a chillingly beautiful voice. You can tell she put all her heart and soul into this role.

Seeing the underwater effects on the big screen was quite an experience. The CGI is very colorful, vivid, and realistic. Truly dazzling to say the least. Lots of warm and funny moments with plenty of emotion, too.

Highly recommend it for both children and adults! 10/10."
"One of the better remakesOf the disney remakes I have seen this is definitly one of the least offensive. Halle Bailey did a really good job in her songs and her acting of mute Ariel was very believable and had some cute moments. Jonah Hauer-King played a decent Eric and the new song for Eric, while kinda unnecessary was a pretty good I want song and I could tell that Lin-Manuel was involved in the writing of the new music. On the topic of new music scuttlebutt was incredibly cringeworthy. I kinda like the idea of it but scuttles voice on top of scuttles personality made the song grating and honestly not a lot of fun. Ursula maintained a very fun performance, not quite on par with the original but fun and she had a few interesting choices. Poor unfortunate souls was still a ton of fun and kiss the girl was still as charming as ever. I had a few problems with under the sea, namely while sebastion was naming the animals in the band, they were not playing instruments, i get that this is a more ""grounded"" movie, however if we are going have lines about fish playing the trumpet have a fish playing the trumpet. The elephant in the room for this movie is certainly the cgi and unfortunately I have to agree with the general consensus, it looks horrendous. The cgi on the mermaids is definitly the best, it looks a little unnatural while they swim but beyond that its pretty convincing but dear god the animals. Sebastion, scuttle, and flounder all look incredibly unnatural while talking and singing. You can tell a few times during the movie that Bailey is completely alone during the shoots and is just being told where to look and how to act. Overall I can say if you are going to watch a Disney remake this is probably your best choice, lacking some of the bad of the previous and definitly being a step up musically, looking at you lion king."
"Worst Disney live actionI was in high school when the original came out. I took my now wife to every disney movie thatbcame out, we love them. This is not like those movies. They have ruined another popular classic with this live action remake. They had so much to work with yet they couldnt pull it off. This movie is boring, slow, and has lackluster effects. Underwater scenes look like special effects from 20 years ago. Many other recent movies have pulled off underwater scenes so much better. With the budget Disney has and what they claimed to have spent on this movie it should have been much better. Halle Barry is an amazing singer but the music in this movie falls flat with no inspiration."
"Felt the Disney magic!I finally felt the magic of Disney again!

Despite a mediocre marketing campaign, Rob Marshall's live-action adaptation of the classic Disney animated film The Little Mermaid turned out to be quite the delightful little film! I really quite enjoyed it, and found it to be one of the better Disney live-action adaptations! Truthfully, while it is still flawed, I didn't expect it to be near as good as it ended up being - and it actually added enough that it not only deemed itself to be a worthy re-telling but also (dare I say it) ended up being better than the original animated feature! The 1989 film has never been my favourite Disney movie, it's no Aladdin or Lion King, but in live-action form, I found it far superior to both those films' live-action counterparts. The reason, not the script, not the visuals, not even the acting - it is all thanks to director Rob Marshall.

For me, Rob Marshall is the new king of Disney musicals - he should just direct them all at this point. Starting his career as a performer and choreographer on Broadway, he soon turned to directing and came out with one of the greatest musical films ever made, Chicago, earning Marshall a Best Director nomination and a Best Picture win at the Oscars that year. Eventually, Marshall came to Disney, directing the fourth Pirates of the Caribbean movie (which isn't my favourite, but it was well-directed), Into the Woods, and the fantastic Mary Poppins Returns! So naturally I was excited to see that he was attached to direct this film, and my god did he ever deliver! If nothing else, this is the best-directed Disney live-action adaptation ever. Marshall truly knows how to craft beautiful, breathtaking scenes with gorgeous imagery - especially when it comes to musical sequences. Even though he directs films now, he still choreographs every single musical sequence in his films, and it really shows! The camera movements, lighting, editing, performances, and everything else going on on-screen work in perfect unison with the music to create a truly show-stopping moment! He truly knows how to shoot a classic musical moment with sweeping magic and majesty that you can't deny! It's just brilliant - especially after Guy Ritchie butchered all the musical sequences in 2019's Aladdin. Plus, the choreography for all the underwater musical sequences was so imaginative! ""Under The Sea"" really felt like classic Disney films such as Fantasia where they used actual dancers as the basis for all the CGI creatures. There's a video circulating online right now of a bunch of people in blue screen suits crawling on the floor doing the turtle choreography from that sequence - and it just shows how much thought Marshall put into these sequences. Yes, a CGI artist wouldn't really use any of what was in that frame - but the detailed reference image allows for this richer, more magical choreography to take place. I just really think Rob Marshall did a fantastic job.

The music itself was fantastic too! The classic songs really worked thanks to some breathtaking performances, but that isn't really a surprise! The new songs written by Lin-Manuel Miranda were the big question for me, and I thought for the most part they were pretty good and added to the movie in really important ways. I love that Eric finally got a strong, emotional ballad to sing with ""Wild Uncharted Waters"", and ""For the First Time"" was a great way of putting us in Ariel's head during her first steps on land. The only one that didn't really land was ""The Scuttlebutt"" which had Awkwafina and Daveed Diggs singing a Hamilton-rap style song, which was fun but didn't fit with the tone of the rest. Still, while these songs were all good in their own ways, and as much as I love Lin-Manuel Miranda, none of them compare to the originals by the incomparable Howard Ashman. Ashman is one of the greatest lyricists, frankly, ever. He ushered in a golden age of Disney musicals, writing pretty much all of the iconic Disney songs from the 90's that we know today. I really loved that this movie was dedicated to him in the credits, as his lyrics are half of the reason it is as impactful as it is. Alan Menkin returned to do the score for this one, and I have to say he really improved the rich orchestral backtrack to all the songs! The entire score was excellent!

The introduction of the wonderful Halle Bailey in her first leading role as a Disney princess is why the movie, and especially the songs, work as well as they do. Seeing her as Ariel made me feel the same way I felt when I saw Rachel Zegler in Spielberg's West Side Story - she's an absolute star and they could not have picked a more perfect actress for the role. The second you hear Bailey start to sing the opening notes of ""Part of Your World"", you realize she has an incredible voice - the new renditions of these songs are magical to listen to because of how talented she is. There is no question in my mind; that is easily what won her the role! But not only does she have an incredible singing ability, but her acting is wonderful too! Bailey's performance was charming, sweet, and overall lovely to watch. She embodied the role of Ariel and carried her spirit throughout. Her mannerisms and expressive eyes tell a whole story even if she lost her voice to Ursula. It genuinely made me sad that she would have to spend half the movie with no voice because of how good her singing was, but luckily they found a way around that with a new song ""For the First Time"", and it gave her the chance to showcase how good an actress she is even without her voice! Truly fit for a Disney princess! Plus her chemistry with Jonah Hauer-King, who played Prince Eric (another perfect casting), made for a romantic relationship to be built instead of it being love at first sight, which is one of the many changes from the original animated feature that really worked. Creating a strong backstory for Prince Eric meant that Ariel would feel that connection just by listening to him rant about wanting to explore and seek adventure overseas. Even without a voice, Ariel expressed how she felt about Eric, and he connected with her because she would listen to him. I loved how the filmmakers really built out the relationship between Ariel and Eric, showing us why they are meant to be together rather than just telling us it was love at first sight. We see their shared interests, how similar they both are, and how they could fit together so well as a couple - really establishing them as literal, bona fide soulmates. It makes the whole film work so much stronger on an emotional level as they put some true romance into the story!

I know I got a little off point there, but I loved both Bailey and Hauer-King's performances and their chemistry! The story they had to work with was really well elevated over the animated film, and it just made the experience of watching this that much more magical! Another excellent casting: Melissa McCarthy as Ursula. She was downright perfect (frankly, all the casting in this movie was), and her rendition of ""Poor Unfortunate Souls"" is already iconic in my mind, just as good, if not better than Pat Carrol's original take on the song. Much like everyone else in the film, she made the role her own! I'm really happy that this movie did offer a lot of new elements besides just nostalgia from the original movie, it made the experience of watching this so much more fulfilling and entertaining!

This film really felt like a sincere remake, not just a corporate mandate. It truly felt like complete Disney magic - and I think that's why I loved it so much! Sure, it wasn't perfect - it was a little too long, played it too safe in some areas, and after seeing Avatar: The Way of Water the underwater CGI just couldn't compare. But damn, I had a swimmingly good time with this movie, I really enjoyed every minute, especially those breathtaking musical sequences! I loved that the additions here actually added to the story and made this film different from your average nostalgia fare. This is the rare remake that surpassed the original, thanks to some excellent work from Rob Marshall, Halle Bailey, Melissa McCarthy, and Jonah Hauer-King! If you love Disney, you need to get out and see The Little Mermaid! It's beautiful!"

"SoullessJust another disney cashgrab remake. The actress for Ariel was amazing and has a beautiful voice, but she was not enough to carry the entire movie on her back. The CGI was awful, the songs were generally unpleasant to the ears, the colour was perpetually too dark to let you appreciate what was happenning, and the script also seemed rather uninspired - only laughed twice or thrice in the entire film. This film could have been so much better, but as it is typical of modern disney, it is yet another cashgrab banking on nostalgia off old movies and putting in zero effort. I feel bad to have given them my money and supported this trend."
"Torn reviewI went into seeing this, with high hopes due to the history of the character, and it definitely did not live up to the hype. The changes in the story, and even the songs just took away part of the meaning of the show, and then some of the casting, such as who is playing kings frighten, definitely did not hold up to the original. It seemed as though it was cast overly expeditiously, and rushed to put out a story, without drawling out all of the lines. It's good for Disney to try to bring forth new people to bring back roles, but making massive changes to the story and even iconic songs seem to take away from what made the movie, so synonymous and historical for the time being that it was based off of a cartoon for a live action adaptation it fell way short."
"Beautiful and praiseworthyIt's hard to make a revision of a beloved classic animated film. So much of who we are is wrapped up in the original Little Mermaid. That being said, this is a beautiful and praiseworthy reimagination of the original. It's not perfect, but it has a lot of great things about it. I think most of the acting is stellar. Hally Bailey does a fabulous job. It takes a lot to portrait emotions and not speak during a third of the movie. Her voice is great, and I have to admit I cried when she sang 'part of your world'.

I am black and I really loved the diversity of the cast, who cares that it's supposed to be colonial time; it's a darn fantasy. I do think CGI is problematic because animation does a much better job with animal expressiveness. I also think it could have been a shorter movie. I liked the additional songs (I think there were only two and that's why it could have been shorter).

I am not sure I liked the way they did the ending. I can't wait till it comes out on Disney+ so I can view it again (because I can't afford to see it in theaters twice, too expensive.)."
"Halle Bailey nails it.Live action remakes are intrinsically hard. Adults who see them can't help but compare them to the original, beat by beat, song by song, and by each casting choice.

Halle Bailey is the best thing about this movie. I loved Jodi Benson's singing but Bailey took these songs and made them her own. Her acting was also superb.

The rest of the movie suffers some of the sins of the original (Eric is flat and boring; the plotting in the final act doesn't really elevate the whole) but it captures those yearnings and longings that mark every childhood.

I love Lin Manuel Miranda but I really didn't like the new music or the little flourishes he added to moments like Under the Sea. Howard Ashman was a genius and Miranda understandably wasn't really going to improve upon the source material.

Attempts were made to add depth to Eric and I don't think it really worked. He was loud in his delivery in the oddest places and his singing was just overwrought shouting.

The scuttlebutt number was more of that loudness. Ashman found ways to use tone and silent spaces to provide breathing space for the feeling in the work.

Maybe the best supporting character in all of Disney lore is Sebastian. The voice acting was fine but the singing was flat and lacked the energy of the original.

Which is to bring this back to Bailey. This movie works because her performance was so incredible. She absolutely carried it.

Bottom line - see it for her."
"Live-action film that makes the story unnecessarily longer, but does not do much with it.The Little Mermaid Is a live-action film adaptation of the 1989 animated film of the same name. This live-action is directed by Rob Marshall, director of Mary Poppins Returns and Chicago. Ariel (Halle Bailey) is a curious mermaid, who is eager to learn more about the human world after rescuing the human prince Eric (Jonah Hauer-King). She also seems to have developed feelings for Eric.

Her father King Triton (Javier Bardem) doesn't need to know anything about the human world and wants his daughter to stay away from it too. Because of this, Ariel makes a deal behind his back with the sea witch Ursula (Melissa McCarthy). In exchange for her voice, she is turned into a human and given three days to discover the human world, but must be kissed by Eric within these three days. If this fails, Ariel will turn back into a mermaid and belong to Ursula. This is the umpteenth live-action film adaptation from Disney, but compared to the animation they do little new with the film. It's just been updated a bit and given a modern twist. The animation lasts about an hour and a half, but this live-action film takes an additional 45 minutes. This extra time is used to give some characters more time like Prince Eric. In the animation, besides that he is a prince, you know little else about the character, but here he gets more of a backstory. The extra time is also spent on new songs that do not appear in the animation. Some of these songs are nice extras or help to make the film a bit more modern, for example by adding a song with rapping. Yet the songs are of the same or sometimes lesser level compared to the songs from the animation. Halle Bailey knows how to play the role appropriately for an actress who is still at the beginning of her acting career. Her stronger side comes from her singing work, because she also has more experience with this. The rest of the film cast also play their roles appropriately, but otherwise do little special compared to the characters from the animation. In order to convey the story more appropriately compared to the book on which The Little Mermaid films are based, they have also cast the actors more so that they come across more appropriately as people who also come from the Caribbean. The visual effects also work more believable one time than the other. With some underwater scenes it sometimes seems as if you are watching a nature documentary about the Caribbean Sea. While in other scenes you can see that the actors are acting in front of a blue screen. The sea creatures in the film also seem a bit strange compared to the animation. The 3D effects look nice during scenes under water and provide beautiful images in which you can see the depth of the ocean, but in scenes above water, little special is done with this."
"Best Disney Live ActionThis is the best Disney Live Action movie. It's just like the original and not some weird live action retelling. It's authentic and true to the OG story with more character development. Halle was born for this role and each actor executes their character so well. Melissa was an amazing Ursula and Prince Eric fit so well.

The wardrobe was on point too!!

The singing is phenomenal. A real looking Flounder and Sebastian just works and makes sense too-I was hesitant on the character posters at first but they happily proved me wrong!

How beautiful to see such a diverse cast. Seeing the ethnic kids after the movie take photos with the movie poster was so cute. I can't imagine how they feel seeing an ethnic Ariel! We've come a long way!!

Kiss the Girl was such a beautiful scene. Felt like a fairytale."
Improves On The OrginalHalle IS Ariel! I've seen this movie twice and will see it again. Awkwafina and Daveed Diggs as Scuttle and Sebastian are hilarious. Melissa McCarthy is sensational as Ursula. The spirit of the original film is there and improves on it with so much more! All the songs and even the new ones are great! If you're not shedding a tear during Part Of Your World you'll be dancing to Under The Sea. Lin Manuel Miranda and Alan Menken did a fantastic job collaborating on the new songs. This for sure is one of the better live action remakes Disney had released over the past few years. It's really made for the true fans of TLM.
"The Little Mermaid is a terrible movieThe Little Mermaid is a horrible movie that should never have been made. It is an insult to the original fairy tale, which was a beautiful and tragic story of love and sacrifice. The movie is a mess of plot holes, contradictions and nonsense that makes no sense at all. The characters are stupid and annoying, especially the main character Ariel, who is a spoiled and stupid mermaid who trades her voice and her soul for a pair of legs and a prince who doesn't even know her name. The animation is ugly and cheap, the songs are irritating and forgettable, and the villain Ursula is a pathetic copy of Maleficent. The movie has no redeeming qualities whatsoever, and it is a disgrace to the art of animation and storytelling. The Little Mermaid is a terrible movie that should be banned from existence."
"Everything You'd Want In a Remake!The beautiful and talented Halle Bailey, Mischievous & seductive Melissa McCarthy playing alongside the stunningly conniving Jess Alexander for her human counterpart, Dreamy Jonah Hauer King as Prince Eric, and overall humor of the movie, Scuttle played by Awkwafina. I've been waiting for this movie for about, what? 4 years and let me say one thing. THIS MOVIE IS EVERYTHING YOULL EVER WANT WITH A DISNEY REMAKE. It's like the original, but also a completely new story at the same time so you don't feel bored throughout the movie, and so you can be surprised as well! The casting is perfect, set is perfect. This movie is just perfect."

"Ugh so cringe such a shameThe Music was bad ,the voices were flat , the new actors had zero charm the movie dragged flounder was barely yellow cmon Disney smh. Remakes are cool but this movie didn't check off any of the boxes. The loin king remake was great..the cgi was good. Ursula and triton were needed to save this movie and stop people from walking out. But even with them it wasn't enough Ariel's hair wasn't even red it was like brown or orange or something. The movie had this weird filter on it where everything just looked dark. Overall I wouldn't recommend to watch just see the original wait till it comes out to rent it . My daughter wasn't even watching it and she loved the cartoon version."
"Just blandI was so so so excited for this. After the watching this endlessly as a child and spending time watching this with my daughter we were pumped.

Half an hour In, we both lost interest. Some scenes were brilliant but the magic just wasn't there. So I forgot about the original and went back to a clear mind as if this was the only version. The actors themselves put on a show and the singing was marvellous (if out of sync at times) but I couldn't get excited about the film. Far too long, daughter decided she had enough and used toilet breaks as an excuse to try split up the film a bit more. We love the Jungle book, we loved Aladdin. We just couldn't immerse into this. Which is such a shame as Halle was a wonderful Ariel."
"Wonderful VisualsA beautiful film that I ended up enjoying more than I thought I would.

This film is about hearing others. Walking through our feelings. Letting people grow and letting people go. Which entails making life decisions, good or bad, which leaves us open to be being easily lead and tricked in our search for ourselves by evil doers and opportunists.

In essence, our hearts are lonely hunters. This narrative is brilliant and is full of so much heart and soul searching. Disney the great story teller always in their narratives seem to keep the message clear that there is always something trying to quash our dreams and happiness. However if we rise above and persevere, maybe we can switch things up. Self effort is always needed.

Although I would admit that there are scenes I prefer in the original version, it doesn't make this reimaging bad at all because the same soul I felt from the original still existed here, and I found my childhood self filled with joy and crying in happiness when I watched it. Definitely one of the best live actions Disney has created."
"It's definetely a ""new Disney"" movie.Well, if you're waiting for something that is revolutionary, i'm sorry, but this movie isn't for you. I really don't get why Disney is producing so much of these live actions that are just boring. I guess that this movie was produced just for the visuals, and guess what? They're not great as the trailers show, you can say this just looking at the water or the mermaid's tails. (We're talking about Disney here, they have a lot of money, and Avatar showed.us that making realistic water is already possible).

The strong points of the movie are Halle Bailey voice and.acting, Awkwafina and Daveed Diggs voices and the new songs, they're good as the old ones. Melissa McCarthy left so much of her talent at home and Jonah Hauer-King don't pull off that acting skills as much as you think.

In general, the movie isn't bad, it's just a live action of a movie that we all have seen a billion times in a infinity of genres and formats. And that's just it. A visual movie that doesn't pull off the visuals that we want to see."
"If the music doesn't put you to sleep, the story willHow is this getting such good reviews? Did I walk into an alternate universe and see something different, I genunily feel bad for Halle Berry, a fallen star. This is a mockery to a beloved fairytale. Even the visual hit and miss at some point. This is a major production that they spent hundreds and millions on. Let's talk about the music, perhaps what the original was best known for, while the classsic animated film gave joy, the ""modern"" film, made me drowzy, as in, I slipped out of consciousness at least four times. Why do producers insist on remakes nobody asked for? Is creativity a dying breed? Melissa Mccarthy is the silver lining in this disrespectful film. Which says alot.

Story: 1/10 Characters: 1/10 Visuals: 4/10 Pacing: 3/10 Acting: 6."
"Love, love and more LOVELook, I'm not going to bore anyone with the usual comments about acting, directing, writing and all that stuff because honestly who cares at this point?. When it comes to Disney movies (especially remakes) you have to look at what kind of IMPACT it makes on peoples lives. I went to the cinema with my sisters, and I saw so many different kinds of people in the cinema. White, black, brown, asian- EVERYTHING. We all equally enjoyed, laughed, gasped and cheered. The world is ever changing, and that day as we were all watching, it truly felt like we were all part of our world. For this, I thank you <3."
"Not Disney's best work in regards to live action remakesStarting out I had little hope for this movie. But I did wind up enjoying it more than I expected. But since this was a kid's movie, I've got to include my kids' thoughts, my 3 year old was grinning ear to ear the entire time, but the movie put my 1 year old to sleep. Do with that information as you will.

My thoughts, Starting out with the good. Halle Bailey did a great job with the role, her voice waa good and her acting was good. Prince Eric's character was well casted. I liked how they included actual myths about mermaids, and even called them sirens. Prince Eric's mother was a good additional character, she was well casted and well written into the story.

Now the things I didn't like. Triton was the worst character in the movie. All of his lines seemed forced and didn't flow naturally. He seemed to stoic and didn't show enough emotion, even when he destroyed Ariel's collection. I didn't like how they changed all of Triton's daughters. I get what they were going for, but they felt like completely new characters. None of the characters, minus Eric and Ursula/Vanessa even remotely resembled the original characters, and made it hard to trigger the nostalgia.

Overall, the movie was enjoyable, but once again, the live action remake has failed to even come close to the original."
"Chat GPT make a live action little mermaidThe scenes felt awkward and dragged, the humor cringy, the story slow and corny, but most of all the characters weak who, beside Ariel, felt like perfunctory extras with no real chemistry between each other. I came in with low expectations and free tickets to spare (as AMC A-list member) so why not I said. I left after an hour or so. I felt uncomfortable in an audience that just seemed underwhelmed and anxious for something interesting to happen. Bad bad bad.

I never saw the original but I did read the fairy tale so LOTS of room to take liberties with the story and no excuse for this bad plot. The music feels perfunctory as well, like it's just been rehashed for the nostalgia points but misses too. No bad singing but no great singing either...ugh. I gave it more than a chance and contemplated leaving 3 times before actually doing so. I'll stay and watch a bad movie but not a cringily bad movie."
"Almost a masterpieceGreat rendition of this Disney classic.

Much like Disney's Cinderella starring Brandy, they went with casting whoever they wanted to for the roles and I think it went really well.

Halle's performance in the movie was top notch and she told a story like no other has during Part of Your World. Her voice fit more than the Jodi Benson version only because Jodi's voice sounded more mature whereas Halle's voice sounded very young and it fit.

The other supporting characters did a good job in the acting portions their vocals during the singing could've used some work.

The only reason this movie doesn't get a perfect 10 is because sometimes the CGI was a little questionable, the supporting casts vocals, and the movie was a little long clocking in at 2.5 hours.

The packed theatre of children loved it and I was right there with them enjoying it. Bravo Disney."
"A fair enough take on the originalI gave this 7 stars because this movie was what it was, a fairy tale. Halle and all the actors worked well with the material they were given. The music was okay and I liked the newer songs but I think that Disney has to rethink live remakes.

I just couldn't get into it, the whole falling in love after an initial encounter doesn't resonate as much since Moana, Frozen and all the other recent Disney movies. It's a new era. Not saying you can't do both but I'm not ready to return to this version of reality.

Kids however should enjoy this and I will always support diversity and inclusion. So give it a go, it just wasn't my thing."
"As bad as I thought it would beIt looks and feels like an old made-for-tv or direct to video sequel that Disney thru together to make a buck. Yes, Halle Bailey has a good voice. But the audio is oddly not lined-up and feels lip-synched. Melissa McCarthy was a great choice for Ursula, and at first, she saved me was feeling I just wasted money on this movie even though my daughter wanted to see it. But towards the end, she just was part of the trainiwreck. The solo song from Eric feels like a SNL spoof. The song is awful and corny and the dancing moves are hilarious. Everyone else has commented on how horrible Flounder, Scuttle and Sebastian look, so no need to go there. The audience was mainly kids and families and everyone walked out with the same look like ""what the hell was that garbage"" look on their faces. Not just bad, really bad."
"Don't waste your time.This movie bored me and my family to tears. Don't waste your time or money on this movie. As a fan of the original Little Mermaid, I was very disappointed in this remake. I enjoyed disney movies back when they were magical with vibrant colors and cute special effects. The Disney I grew up with is no longer. The Disney magic is gone. If you are looking for a magical movie with excellent special effects, I highly recommend going to see Avatar. Disney should take notes from James Cameron. I give this a 2 rating at most and that is being very generous. This movie was a complete fail. Save your money and skip this."
"Outstanding!!!This is by far the best Disney live action movie ever made! There are a few small changes throughout the movie, but they're all good changes in my opinion. The new songs are all delightful and the new Scuttle is hilarious. Halle Bailey was perfect as Ariel. She couldn't have done any better. Her voice is just hauntingly beautiful and so powerful. She looks stunning throughout the movie. The chemistry was there between Ariel and Eric and Eric's song delivered so much emotion. The Little Mermaid was my favourite Disney movie as a child and now The Little Mermaid live action movie is my favourite Disney movie as an adult. I can't wait to watch it again!!!"
"Slightly disappointingI've been a Disney fanatic my entire life for as long as I can remember, so I was looking forward to seeing one of my favorites in live action.

I guess I have more questions than anything. First of all, Halle was amazing, I loved her as Ariel, her singing was spot on. But where is the flaming red hair- Ariel's signature feature? Why were all of the sisters names changed? Where was the sparkly dress? (😭) Why did Sebastian and Flounder look ridiculous? Why did they have Scuttle do that awful song?

While some of it was colorful and pretty, some of it was dark and hard to see. The added songs were cringe. I guess my expectations were too high, idk. My kids liked it, which is a plus. But it is a tad long and they got tired of sitting there after the first hour."
"A remake that's not like the originalThis movie tried to adjust the script too much. Until I felt that the original conveyed the emotion of love better.

Ariel does not show love for Eric. But it's more like trying to occupy.

I was quite disappointed with her facial expression.

Flounder and Sebastian were too realistic.

I like Vanessa and Ursula acting well. Until I want to be the villain in the story.

I think this remake made me want to go back and watch the original rather than remake. And I'm so sorry I didn't see Ariel the way I did. I really like Ariel T T.

I hope Disney will understand and respect the original more in the next movie."
"It was fun!We know the story. It was still so well done. The visuals are beautiful. The storyline is sweet still and I loved everything about it and the music was very good. They really gave more backstory to Ursula and the king and they also really did a good job giving Eric a little bit more of a storyline as well. I thought that everybody did a great job. And I would see this again. I went with kids and they really enjoyed it. I was dancing at the end because if you don't like under the sea and you're not gonna enjoy the movie very much. It's such a fun time if you have the time and you wanna take your kids to a nice movie, take them to go see this."
"Could have been greatHalle is as good as Ariel as Angelina is for Maleficent. She sounds just like Ariel. I love all of Halles songs in this movie. Shes the best part of this movie and shes perfectly casted.

Mellissa did well as Ursula but thats where all the good things end.

Im a huge fan of the original little mermaid and HallexChloe. But the movie was just okay. It wasnt bad but it wasnt good either. Just okay. I wish it was great.

The good things they added dont replace all of the good things they took away. Im left feeling satisfied but wanting more. I wanted to see a more fleshed out version of the original movie, but i got this odd cross between the original and something new instead. And I wish Disney would have just picked one. Do you want to be a new and original story or do you want to retell Ariels story? I think Disney is trying to do both and its causing their live actions movies to suffer because they lack a clear identity.

As for the songs, Halles Part of your world, the first time, and Ursulas poor unfortunate souls are the only good ones. The other 3 songs like Scuttlebutt, Uncharted Waters (the princes song), and under the sea were trash. The ending was trash. But the Ursula fight scene was brilliant. I loved it. So yea im really torn here."
"LIke Your Boring Breakfast, Except You are Forced To Eat It This Time!The Little Mermaid suffers the same problems as the Jungle Book and Aladdin. This issue ruins many movies that have an amazing cast, music and directors that could have been put to making something groundbreaking.

Instead we get a retelling of a movie that is already known to most people. You might think in a different packaging the movie will be even more beautiful and memorable and who knows what else! But the live-action will wear off, the fancy graphics and music will keep your attention for a while, before you realize you already know the ending to the movie and you have to sit through this for 2 hours. Best to bring something to pass time.

But at the end most kid movies are about making sure your child enjoys it. And if you've been to G-Rated movies, you already know what to expect."
"People can be cruel.I wish we could take all the ignorant hate away that poor Halle took and takes off people and cut it from the reviews. People either directly criticising her or hiding behind other reasons it's really sad. A child wouldn't care, it's you which does. If it's her acting fine but just be better.

I made the assumption as water is dark in animation that light skin stands out better and pops better in a cartoon, something as simple as that, I doubt it was a cast iron set in stone decision.

That out the way, her voice is phenomenally good, her emotional acting was strong and you could see exactly what she was going for, her connection with the excellent male lead was great to, I'd maybe say her on land acting didn't pop as much but maybe that was just because the sea world is beautiful. The world here was incredible.

The support cast were amazing all of them , for me awkwafina is the best new age voice actor, historical as skuttle, both Sebastian and flounder were great to, best creatures out of any live remake. Songs were on point but MVP was Melissa, her acting was awesome but her singing! Amazing. Great film.

I felt it was more of a girly and kiddy film as a cartoon but this version feels more inclusive of everyone."

"Please stop with the remakesThe Little Mermaid was my absolute favorite movie growing up and I was so looking forward to this. Sadly, to me it sank.

With the budget I'm sure they had, you'd think the CGI would have been better. They completely ruined the look of Flounder and Scuttle, I have no idea what they were doing when they tried to bring them to life. The songs were okay but it was frustrating how they changed the words to Kiss The Girl, that was so unnecessary.

I wasn't impressed with Melissa's portrayal of Ursula, it wasn't memorable at all.

Halle has one of the best voices I've ever heard, she's an amazing singer but I wasn't impressed with her in this role.

This remake just seems to be missing all of the essential elements that made the original such a masterpiece. The acting, songs and overall feeling of this movie was lacking.

I wish they'd stop remaking all of these classics, it's doing nothing but ruining them.

Please start making new movies and get new ideas. At this point, Disney is just ruining movies from our childhood.

I really wanted to love this movie and I'll most likely watch it again but it doesn't even compare to the original."
"Not goodI can't believe this is what we've been waiting for. Disney needs to really look at their live action plans moving forward and avoid making mistakes like this one. Original was so much better, by a long shot. Pinocchio was similar so this makes two movies in the past year that have failed. Disney had some amazing work in the early days and it's almost disrespectful when the live action doesn't live up to the original. Sebastian was almost scary instead of lovable. Ariel had some bad CGI stuff going on. The only character that was okay was Javier Bardan. Lastly, Melissa McCarthy Was great. Very realistic."
"A nice day outI went to watch this movie with my little girl.

To be honest - I wasn't expecting anything special because I'd already read the disappointing reviews on here. However, i still went... I even forked out the extra £2 each for 3D glasses.

Verdict - me & my daughter where both happy.

Plenty of plot twists and characters here to keep you entertained for a few hours. A feel good classic!

Hans Christian Andersen would be proud of this body of work. And to complement the special effects and great acting - there's a great score with some familiar bangers.

Just one bit of feedback - my daughter and I agreed that the 3D effects weren't anything special... they started off well, but weren't that impressive later on in the movie."

"MehI saw this at an early screening. It is an enjoyable enough film, but not worth the hype. However, Halle Bailey is totally amazing and a born star. She lights up the screen every time she features. Melissa McCarthy as Ursula is also good and suitable scary but with just the perfect amount of humour. And speaking of humour Sebastian is great. Flounder however is pointless and a waste of time- he didn't add anything to the story. Ariel and Eric have fantastic chemistry but I do think Eric as a character fell short with Jonah Hauer-King being a bit bland. Javier Bardem was a massive disappointment in this an was completely wooden- I don't think his script helped with this.

In terms of the film as a whole, the first 20 minutes or so we're a massive slog and I was bored but once the film got going it was ok. The original songs are good and Halle's voice suits hers perfectly. Scuttlebut was a total cringe.

All in all, I was just expecting something more due to the hype. I actually preferred Peter Pan and Wendy, which I had seen no publicity for."
"A fresh take on a beloved classic9.9/10

the CGI looked great in some scenes and others I was like ""ooof, this aint it Disney"".

I love the expanded world that we got to see the village and its people.

Music - I liked the entire soundtrack so no complaints - I will say I was meh on 'kiss the girl' and 'under the sea' when I heard the audio for those songs, but after seeing it in action in the context of the movie, great songs! Alan Menken and Lin Manuel Miranda did their thing!

Halle - was incredible as Ariel. I cried after she sang Part of Your World. Her singing was phenomenal, but also her acting. The way she emoted even when Ariel couldn't speak was wow! She was super charming and charismatic. This girl is going places if she keeps it up. I understand even more why she won the role of Ariel.

Her chemistry with Jonah was wow! They were so believable as a couple and I love the way they made it happen organically between Ariel and Eric. The way he learned her name, the way he looks at her, just swoon! They make you believe in romance again. You end up rooting for this couple.

Jonah was a great prince Eric, he brought more out of the character and had presence on screen without overshadowing Halle. I liked his emotional song to Ariel.

Melissa McCarthy as Ursula - A+. She was playful, funny and sinister. I loved her spin on Ursula and that final scene with her was nightmare fuel!!

Javier Bardem as King Triton - I wasn't super impressed during most of the scenes until the last couple one's. Then I was like ok, I'm feeling it now. The issue was the animated King Triton you still had sympathy for him as a father. Javier made Triton this cold, unfeeling, my way or the high way dad until the end. At the end you can tell he really does love Ariel but I would have liked to have seen that the whole movie.

Sebastian - hilarious. Daveed Diggs did a great job.

Awkwafina - was actually pretty funny, she did really good playing this obnoxious loud mouth bird. Love the dynamic between scuttle and Sebastian.

Jacob - wasn't in the movie much but was adorable and endearing in the scenes he was in; he sounded just like the original flounder.

Ariels other sisters - loved their designs and that they represent different parts of the world. Would love to see a series with them and their adventures underwater since each of them rule a different ocean.

I like that the story was expanded that they included more of the original story from the book. I think this was one of Disney's best live actions to date.

Honorable mention: The actress who played Vanessa, Jessica Alexander!! The girl acted the heck out of the few scenes she was in! She had the seductress thing going on; I loved it.

I do think the end leaves room for a sequel potentially.

I saw it in IMAX, and there were people of all races and ages there. I saw couples, and families. Little girls were singing along to Part of your World with Halle which was so sweet and bobbing in their seats during the scuttlebutt song. Little girls dressed as Ariel. I will definitely go see it again, I genuinely enjoyed it."
"Halle, Javier, and Melissa were magical.Thought this movie was a great kids movie. I loved Halle's version of the character. She gave Ariel life and depth the cartoon version lacked. Bardem's King Triton was exceptional. And, Melissa's Ursula was epic. The diversity that so many hate is what made this movie so relatable. Halle did for the Ariel what Brandi did for Cinderella. It allowed every little girl an opportunity to see that an imaginary princess can come in all shades and colors. It encourages them, that when they read a book or see a movie, they do not have to limit their desires, acceptance, and possibilities to the physicality of what they see. They can see themselves in these characters despite the versions painted for them. I loved that Sebastian was presented with the physical imperfection of his obviously deformed left claw. Another nod to the acceptance and inclusion. I wish for this world as much love and acceptance as Ariel has thingamabobs."
"whyThis is not good and original is still awesome go watch that. I really don't know what more to say about this piece of cinema that others didn't already say and Disney is going down the drain with these remakes. Original movie was so capturing and shiny this is just dark and sad, I don't understand also why she has a red hair and not her natural color when they already swapped races they could let her have her hair color. Maybe seems petty to comment on that but those are little details that really annoyed me. I think that AI would write better stories than these so called writers in Hollywood."
"Go see it!Having been an 80s baby I loved the original Disney animated version of ""The Little Mermaid."" I knew I wanted to see the live action version but was skeptical they could do it justice. All I have to say is ""WOW!"" It far exceeded my expectations. Halle Bailey was pure perfection as Ariel. Her voice was beautiful, her non-verbal expressions during the time she had no voice was on-point. Eric was perfectly cast. He was charming. I loved his song (although the music drowned out his voice). What can you say about Melissa McCarthy?! She embodied Ursula. Really every single person they cast was perfect... EXCEPT Javier Bardem. I usually like him as an actor but he was terrible in this role. He showed no emotion. King Tristan is supposed to be powerful and he did not pull it off."

"Another wasted opportunityThe movie could have been a great remake. They did many things right but every time i was having fun, they ruined it with their laziness and lack of inspiration. Triton was barely acting, the songs did sound good but looked awful with no energy and no colourful sights that made the underwater world look like an eye candy in the animated movie... The CGI looked really bad a few times, the animal characters looked awful and the scuttlebutt song was horrible! Ursula was good, Eric had an interesting backstory and personality and his connection with Ariel was much more fleshed out than the animated movie... But then the third act slaps you in the face with nonsensical and unneeded changes... I expected it to be much worse, it's actually my second best rated Disney remake, but it still wasn't as good as it could be and in no way comes close to the original movie."
"Complete trashThe only saving grace was Halle's voice and although impressive was nothing unique or special. None of the many changes to the movie were an improvement to the original. I made it a point to prescreen the movie before allowing my kids to watch it. Needless to say I will not be allowing my kids to see this.

Aquafina's rap song was utterly horrific and I pray that my kids never hear it. The thought of being subjected to that over and over again as kids are prone to do would actually make me long to be water boarded.

Most of the movie was excessively and unnecessarily dark and the animation was grossly subpar compared to what we know is possible."
"This little mermaid swims with real fish!In my opinion, the classic animated movie needn't to be fixed. It was perfect - as animated cartoon movie. But a live action adaptation can add and explore more on a more mature level , and so this is a delightful opportunity to play around with the script. More time for Ariel and Eric as kindred spirits, more insight in Ariel's head to make her very relatable - and less focus on funny cartoon animals, but more on the young couple . In my opinion, Halle Bailey captures a lot the spirit of The Little Mermaid. I also feel that some details make it even closer to the original tale. Which means .... I see more Andersen's famous mermaid in her than I felt for the animated counterpart. Andersen's Little Mermaid has definitely earned a spectacular musical under the sea, and an addition to rare live action adaptations (and other animated - such like the East Asian version in Happily ever after). A honor to the bronze statue at Kopenhagen, this might be also done by a bronze skinned actress. Halle Bailey is made to be Disney princess and siren - despite some visual differences from her animated counterpart. This remake might be a not a full copy of the 89 movie, but with songs, rainbow-colorful Caribbean vibes, funny sidekicks and a breathtaking graceful lead it definitely feels like a true Disney movie - less slapstick and less cozy, yet, full of romance and adventure. In a nutshell, both are great versions, just like both Disney Cinderella movies, these are two similar yet still also different Little Mermaid movies, but in comparison to Cinderella, this remake captures better the magic of Disney with keeping songs, sidekicks and sweetness."

"They could have done betterThey could have done better

Ariel and Eric don't seem to have that good of chemistry, that scene on the carriage ride was no strong looks between then

They changed lyrics of a couple of the songs for pretty much no reason, there wasn't really a reason to change them.

What is going on with Flounder and Scuttle? The animation was just subpar for those two. I know that it's a live action so it's supposed to be more realistic but they did those two a disservice.

Ariel doesn't have the beautiful red hair, how can they call it a 'live action remake' when she doesn't have the red hair?

Vocals were good but come on."
"Beautifully Made FilmMy family and I thoroughly enjoyed this film. I always loved the original, and haven't thought much of some of the live action remakes, but went to the theater with an open mind. I glad I did. Halle Baille did a fantastic job as Ariel, and Melissa McCarthy totally rocked it as Ursula! The guy who played the king looked a bit out of place and low energy, but the rest of the cast was top drawer. The guy who played the prince was especially dishy. The songs and orchestration were wonderful, though they could have dropped that rap song. And the visuals were just stunning. I saw it in an IMAX and it was like being under the sea. Disney obviously did a lot of research nto sea life around the Carribean because they created a rich, vibrant under sea world with many realistic looking fish ad other marine animals. I was worried that it might seem overly long, but I found that the time went by quickly. On the whole, I thought it was a very well made film."
"Too loud, too scaryA young senior and an eight year old watched this together. Three times the eight year old said she wanted to leave: the volume was so loud it was actually hurting our ears and the opening scene on the ship (and again later with the evil octopus) were both very frightening, even for an 8 year old.

We made it through and enjoyed the story; thought that Ariel was beautiful, the mermaid costumes were well done, the songs were fun and the artwork excellent -- but why they have to play it so loud that we kept our fingers in our ears through much of it. I cannot imagine bringing 3 to 6 year olds to this movie even though the story was for children."
"Terrible and bad film! Save your moneyI recently had the misfortune of watching a movie that left me thoroughly disappointed and dissatisfied. ""The Little Mermaid"" it turned out to be a terrible film, riddled with numerous flaws that made it a truly divisive experience. From the poor acting to the lackluster execution, this movie failed to live up to even the most basic expectations.

First and foremost, the acting was abysmal. The performances delivered by the cast were so wooden and uninspired that it was hard to believe these were supposed professionals. Their lack of depth and emotion only served to amplify the already glaring flaws of the film. It's disheartening to witness such a waste of talent.

Moreover, the storyline itself was poorly developed, leaving the audience perplexed and disconnected throughout. The plot lacked coherence and failed to engage on any meaningful level. Scenes felt disjointed, and character motivations were either unclear or simply nonexistent. It was as if the filmmakers had no regard for proper storytelling techniques.

Furthermore, the title character, Ariel, was a major letdown. Instead of being a compelling and relatable protagonist, she came across as shallow and uninteresting. The portrayal lacked depth, leaving viewers struggling to empathize or even care about her journey. It's unfortunate when the central character of a film fails to captivate and engage the audience.

To make matters worse, the movie was accompanied by a persistent stench of disappointment, comparable to the putrid smell of rotting fish. It's a shame when a film not only fails to meet expectations but also leaves behind an unpleasant aftertaste that lingers long after the credits roll.

""The Little Mermaid"" was a terrible movie that left bad taste. The stench of disappointment that accompanied this cinematic experience has certainly made an impact, and I have no intention of revisiting this film or anything resembling it."
"Very, very enjoyable.As a huge disney fan and being a fan of the original since a small child - came out in the year I was born, I very enjoyed this film and felt like it did the original justice.

Obviously nothing will ever be the same as an original, but there was nothing not to enjoy, the music and characters were absolutely spot on, just a different take.

If I could moan about anything I feel like it could have been cut a little bit shorter, 2h 15min for a film essentially made for children is long.

Also - big shout out to Melissa McCarthy, scene stealer! She was absolutely fantastic.

I will watch again when available."
"Sad, but trueIt's just not good at all, honest can't think of one nice thing to say, had such high hope for this live action and left the movie theatre wanting my money back.

Added pointless storylines, that wasn't integral to the main story and some didn't go any further than just saying it out loud.

Disappointed from start to finish and what is with the songs, changing the lyrics, tempo and just whole feel.

It defiantly wasn't broken so why attempt to fix it, no wonder it failed.

CGI sea creatures and coral are horrifying, tried to go realism but just missed the mark

Had to watch the original just to get the bad fishy taste out of my mouth."
"Boring and underwhelmingAs expected, this movie bombed big time. Terrible acting from the main character, no chemistry, no charm, no talent. Just a total waste of time and money. A real slap in the face of the original classics. It seems Disney really has run out of ideas, and instead of coming up with something new, recycles old ideas into terrible live-actions. This movie isn't even worthy of the $1 bin at your local discount store, let alone having to pay inflated movie theater prices to see it. It's no wonder the theater was half empty! This is definitely the last live-action atrocity I will ever pay to see in theaters, because Disney just keeps pumping out bigger and bigger disappointments."
"One of the best movie this yearI really enjoyed the movie, it was amazing. Way more than I expected. First of all her voice was amazing and fits the character, the songs and the colors are great, they added new songs, love it. Halle was the perfect choice for Ariel, she was amazing and phenomenal.

The cast did a wonderful job, Ursula was the perfect casting for the villain role, I could feel Disney have their all in this movie. My little sister enjoyed the movie and couldn't get enough.

Also the romance in this movie was great, they gave prince Eric a personality and actually likes Ariel for who she is, they had an amazing chemistry."
"Disney, you've ruined my favourite Disney film :( Thanks a lot.Dreadful CGI and the film completely lost all the vibrancy and life of the original little mermaid sadly. Honestly, I have to say I felt let down by the actors portrayals of their characters and perhaps felt they were not given good direction from the directors and producers etc? The additional songs were just so boring and felt out of place in connection to the old Little Mermaid that we all know and love (and were just bad songs in general). It was just boring, unorignial and felt lacking in many ways.

The Little Mermaid (Original) was a much better watch and this was a waste of $$$$

And what the hell is with the scuttlebutt song??? Ffs Disney where has your ability to have timelessness and grace gone? Just a song for children to play on loop in their heads, but provide them with no real substance, meaning or connection to the world around them."
"Top Tier Disney RemakeI went into this movie with low expectations, mostly due to the disappointing recent Disney live-action remakes. Halle Bailey and the rest of ""The Little Mermaid"" production won me over and I left the theater a fan. The casting was excellent, with Melissa McCarthy's Ursula and Jonah Hauer-King's Prince Eric standing out.

Not only were the performances strong, but the screenwriter added depth to the story. From Ursula's backstory to the relationship between Ariel and Eric, the added scenes were excellently placed. The film stayed true to the source material while also elevating it in the process.

Late last year, ""Avatar: The Way of Water"" completely changed the game for underwater cinematography. Unfortunately, this film's underwater moments did not meet the same high bar. Similarly, though most of the cast was stellar, I had a hard time stomaching the performances of Javier Bardem (King Triton) and Awkwafina (Scuttle).

One of the selling points of this movie was the addition of three new songs from Lin Manuel Miranda (""Hamilton"" and ""Encanto""). While I am usually a fan of his work, these new songs were not anything special. One of the songs, ""The Scuttlebutt"" is particularly awful, though the teenagers in my theater seemed to enjoy it.

Of the 17 Disney remakes since 2010, this is one of the strongest. Ariel's voice is the best of any of the live-action princesses, and the story stayed true to the original while adding interesting depth. There are multiple ""chill-worthy"" moments, including an incredible rendition of ""Kiss the Girl"".

Note: I said that I didn't like the new songs, but ""Wild Uncharted Waters"" gets better each time I listen to it.

Best Character: Eric Best Quote: ""Don't be held back by what you think should be. Think of only what is."" - Grimsby Best Scene: Kiss the Girl Best Song: ""Wild Uncharted Waters"""
"Another live action bore festWhen the best thing in your movie is Melissa Mccarthy then you've got problems, big problems. But we already knew that with previous live action flops. Which Disney seems to be obsessed with making recently. Please, just make it stop. I remember when this company was the gold standard for movie making. It's a former shadow of itself. The lead was wooden. She's a great singer, but her acting is on par with the wood used to build Prince Eric's ship. Like the rest of their dull, lifeless remakes it offers nothing new. Just more of the usual pandering. If I was an investor with Disney I'd want to know why they keep making this trash. Who is it aimed at, honestly? It's truly baffling."
"LovelyThey did a great job with this version! I grew up obsessed with the original and I love this remake. Halle did an amazing job acting and her voice truly is a sirens song. If I had any complaints it would be that her hair would be more of a deep red but the color was beautiful on her and worked. With any remake we have to be prepared for things not to be the same, as it shouldn't be. This is a newer version of a great movie. If it were exactly the same it wouldn't be as interesting as something new. I love this version and am so glad it is finally out! Let go of preconceived notions from the previous version and enjoy it. Ohh and King Triton having his beautiful eclectic daughters from the seven seas? Loved it!"
"DullThe movie lacked the colourful blue sea , dark in every shot , Ariel was a firy character with amazing spirit , the actor was not able to express any emotions during the movie , no feelings when sad or when happy or when surprised ....you ruined one of the main Disney characters and replaced her with someone not even close spiritually before feature ..changed the movies and left amazing parts ...I Didn't like it a bit ...don't recommend. Pls pls leave the classic movie as it is ..don't replace amazing movies with bad copies ...I was born in 1982 and that was my favourite movies I have posters and toys and stickers for Ariel seeing that new version really disappointed me and relaxing her with a very strange choice made really disappointed and it is not about colour ..when the hair it was a disaster."
"Gets the minimum out of the source materialThat headline is fairly negative, but I mildly enjoyed this remake of the Disney classic. There is a lot of good here. It's filled with cool images, both imaginary and real. It's visually pleasing. And I think they did a great job with the casting (mostly).

The songs from the original are great as expected, although I have trouble giving the remake credit for that. There are four new songs, and three of them feel completely inferior to the originals. They are instantly forgettable. There is one funny one involving Sebastian and Scuttle.

While much of the movie is a word-for-word remake, they make some small changes to the original. I'm not someone who flips out about changes to the source material like with so many comic book fans. If it's good, I'll like it. But most of the changes seem inconsequential. They're not bad, but they don't benefit the remake.

I enjoyed Halle Bailey in the lead role. The only problem is, I kept feeling like animated mute Ariel was more expressive than live-action mute Ariel. But I don't think it's the fault of the actress. It's like they didn't even try, possibly a problem with the writing or directing. One of the changes to the story made her seem more like a simpleton than a mute.

Melissa McCarthy is a perfect choice for Ursula. But again, I have one problem with the performance. She randomly loses her accent. And it's not because she unable to hold it. There are intentional moments where she loses the accent, usually played for comedy. And I don't know why, but I didn't buy Javier Bardem at all as King Triton.

While I enjoyed most of the visuals, there is some awful CGI when it comes to the underwater people. They frequently look cartoonish. I kept wondering if they were fully CGI rather than what I would expect, which is real life upper body and CGI lower body.

Even with all that, I still had a decent time with this movie. It's not the worst way to spend your time. I just wish they would do more with the source material in these remakes. Use the original as a basis and create a new story with the characters. Something like Maleficent.

(1 viewing, opening night IMAX 5/25/2023)"
"SING IT HALLE SING IT!!!As a 45 year old man who displayed no interest in anything The Little Mermaid I have to say I was impressed by this movie! Halle Bailey's role as Ariel peaked my interests in the first trailer. From there I checked out the original cartoon and thought it was okay but needed to be updated to resonate with today's audience. Her voice did it for me though not to mention the special effects displayed. In this movie she was definitely the stand out along with the actress that voiced the sea gull (sorry, forgot her name). My only gripe was the casting of Prince Eric and his unnecessary background story. He also sung the worst song in my opinion. The remix to Under the Sea was great and any song Halle had to sing elevated the enjoyment factor! Watch out for this actress/singer...she is on her way!"
"I'm in two minds about thisI'd love to say that Disney finally got it right, that The Little Mermaid surpassed expectation and delivered a nostalgic yet reinvigorated tale of a young woman desperate for adventure, and all the love, heartache & magic that comes with it.

Alas, that wasn't the case. While I enjoyed the first part and being swept away by Halle Bailey's glorious voice and the vibrant mermaid tails on display, the visual effects and changes to the storyline because of the ""live action"" stamp were disappointing. It's true that casting was the hot topic with this remake, but I think it's one of the aspects they got mostly right. I can't fault Bailey as Ariel, and Melissa McCarthy gave her own fun twist to Ursula (despite pointless changes to the character herself). Javier Bardem was okay as King Triton, he's a minor character in the scheme of the storyline so for that part he did fine. Torn about the casting for Eric, Jonah Hauer-King was good but he wasn't the right match for Bailey's Ariel - the chemistry was lacking between them. Granted, the changes to his character made him more endearing - well, except for that stupid solo song. I love Lin Manuel, but what a useless addition to the soundtrack. Especially given the quality of the original songs and how they were delivered.

As for our live action side kicks, I wasn't against the changes to Scuttle as Awkwafina is a legend, and Daveed Diggs has the right inflections for Sebastian's iconic voice. Ugh but Flounder - they essentially made his character redundant. And let's be honest, no live action animal looks as exciting as a cartoon version, so the film loses points here as well.

I'm of two minds about this adaptation. It stays truest to the version I grew up with when compared to the horrendous string of live action remakes I've seen (2015's Cinderella was the exception). 90% of the music was spot on, the diversity of both kingdoms was an exciting improvement, the bright colours and costumes a homage to the 1989 classic. And kudos for Jodi Benson's cameo too. But I question the changes to the storyline and final scene, the amendments to multiple characters, the additions to the soundtrack and the visual effects - all of which diminished the experience. That being said, I am sure the kids growing up with this version of The Little Mermaid will love it. It's worth dressing up your little princesses for their chance to see it.

"Possibly Disney's Best remake yetWhat a joy this was to see. Right from the start of the movie you're in it. It's vibrant, thoughtful, hugely nostalgic and acted/sung beautifully by Halle Bailey. Her voice is gorgeous by the way. There's not one person who after seeing the film that wouldn't agree that she was born for this role.

The extra run time compared to the much shorter original is filled with additional scenes and songs that fitted perfectly with the film (even Eric's dodgy solo!)

After a string of not so good remakes, Disney has finally hit it out the park with this one possibly knocking Cinderella off of its throne as the best live action yet.

Well done 👏🏼"
"this was simply a bad made movieI always hope that liveaction are going to be good, but It was really bad, the acting was mediocre on al fronts, and becous of the change in areiel with dark skin and brown hair it never felt like I was watching areiel even if HB sang pretty good.

(I grew up with the pale readhead, and thats ariel for me), I meen it cant be that hard to find an actor/actress that looks close to the original.

The music never manage to catch hold on me as the original did, and dont get me started on the ""rapbattle"" LOL

the visual CGI felt just disconnected. Under the sea it just felt they floated around and I never felt I saw it was in water. Even on land it felt cartoonish.

Even if they have naild ARIEL, it wud not have saved the movie because CGI/acting/cut/music was so bad."

Poor CGI and just bad movie remakeThe CGI is terrible the acting under the water is jerky and is hard to watch at times. The songs are good expect for Akwafieena's terrible song it hurt to listen. The movie was to long and was 40 minutes to long. The cartoon runtime was a good run time but this movie just spent to much time just moving and nothing going on. McCarthy was ok and was not to bad. The singing by everyone except Scuttle was on point and not bad. Overall I was disappointed and will not be adding this to my collection nor watching it again. Save your money and time and watch the cartoon. If this is Disney's best then we are in trouble.
"Shouldn't have happenedPer the usual, Halle did a great job with what she had. She went to work and did the job well.

That said, the movie as a whole fails miserably. I've only seen one Disney live action remake that I actually enjoyed (the Jungle Book). The rest, including TLM, are a hollow-soulless shell of what they're remaking. It tried to add more context, which could have been a good thing, but sticking to the original, beat by beat, kills it. It fails to capture the wonder and excitement of the animated version and even devalues the male lead by making him the damsel in distress in the end.

Do not recommend."
"You NEED to become apart of this world!I had SO MUCH anticipation for this film as it was discussed for so long before having a release date. While I was excited, I was also nervous about seeing one of my beloved childhood films get adapted into a live action. I am happy to say that it exceeded my expectations!

I felt transported back to my childhood and got choked up early watching ""Part of Your World"" be performed. I felt like I was at Disney and watching this at Disney Springs (I was not btw).

I thought the casting was fantastic. Halle is a true Disney princess and Jonah is a wonderful Eric. I love all the updates they did for their characters but also in their relationship. I feel I could feel his love for her and it was on so much of a deeper level. I also loved the new inclusion of songs. I can't wait to re-watch it!"
"I'd rather not be a part of your world.Between the lackluster effects, bland acting, nonsensical story and writing that once again feels like they're too hard to fix what isn't even broken, this is a remake that looks and feels hollow and empty. There is no life, there is no soul, I felt no passion or love in any of this. The only compliment I can give this movie is Halle Bailey's singing voice was very pretty to listen to. Aside from that though, there's really nothing of substance I got. I hope Halle has a successful career because I can tell you, I'm going to be dumping this film and sticking to her music.

Simply put, compared to the original animated film, this remake is dead in the water."
"PerfectionSpectacular visuals. Perfectly cast. Halle gave me chills with her stunning vocals & wonderful acting. I balled me eyes out by the end. The only original animated movie to merit a live action version, in my opinion. Jonah Hauer-King was the dreamiest Eric. And with the extra time, they did a great job fleshing out Eric's backstory & what emotionally brings him and Ariel together. Melissa McCarthy knocked it out of the park with her rendition of Ursula - and she was really scary (in a good way) by the end. I hope they make a behind-the-scenes because the effects are mind-blowing. WHAT a beautiful film!!"

"A film that will forever be part of my worldBefore I start giving my thoughts on this film, despite what everyone thinks, I actually enjoy Disney's live action remakes of some of their films. Yes there were one or two stinkers, but I love how they are re-telling stories in live action and they are re-making them for new generation of fans who are getting into Disney. Some of the remakes I would say are better than the original. This film, is definitely one of them.

Halle Bailey was a fantastic Ariel. She brought charm, elegance and what a beautiful singing voice. All the actors were fantastic, Akwafina and Dave's Digs provided the voices of Sebastian and Scuttle and they were both hilarious! Javiar Bardem was good as Ariel's strict but loving father King Triton, Jonah Hauer King was fantastic as Eric but the scene stealer in this movie is Melissa McCarthy as Ursula. She was scary, terrifying and I bet Pat Carrol would give her a round of applause for her performance!

People complain how the visual effects is bad, but I thought how they created the underwater scenes were fantastic ( ""Part of your World"" and ""Under the Sea"" were the highlights). I think cause of the success of Avatar: The Way of Water, people expect it to match that quality. They also complain how they ruined characters like Flounder and Sebastian. Well making a live action movie that is set in the Ocean, of course they have to make it as realistic as possible. If they kept it how they look in the original movie, then it wouldn't be realistic because there are a lot of things that they can get away with in animation that wouldn't work for a live action movie.

I love the three new songs they've added in, with three written by the fantastic Alen Menken and the brilliant Lin Manual Miranda. I love certain changes they made with this movie and there were some backstories for certain characters. Some of them worked, some of them didn't. That's just my only criticism.

If you aren't a fan of Disney live action remakes and you've just been disappointed with them (which it's a fair criticism) then this film isn't for you. If you're like me who enjoy them, then you'll have a blast."
"some good partsIt was actually good in some parts, However the overall picture was just not one of The classics that Disney is known for. My kids could not grasp the movie in general. I may have grasped too much, That's the reason and only reason for a low score from myself.

The movie is way to long for the story and it gets boring fast. The 135 movie causes children minds to wonder off to the floor and adults eyes find a new spot in the back of ones head! This movie lacks a story line that is comprehensible to children and young adults , in fact lets include adults in that category. Such a shame because again some parts will make you smile but the overall picture makes you frown."
"Very disappointing!Husband, daughter, niece, nephew and I went - after adoring the original animated version, we were so excited to be able to get tickets for this live action remake. We are also generally very big fans of those selected for the lead roles. However, we felt strongly that unfortunately the acting fell flat. The various singing numbers was also not nearly up to the fidelity of the original. The soundtrack on the original was world class and has so many fond childhood memories! We hoped it would at least be comparable but really was a disappointment. The kids were bored and asking to leave. Wait for it to stream if you must waste your time."
"Controversies aside, a great filmThe Little Mermaid, my all time favourite childhood Disney princess!

Casting was mostly great. I thought Daveed Diggs was an excellent Sebastian, and Halle Bailey made the role of Ariel her own. I was disappointed in Javier Bardem's wooden performance, and I wasn't sure about Melissa McCarthy as Ursula, I personally feel that someone like Glenn Close would have suited the role better, or maybe even Kathy Bates.

I loved all of the Easter eggs and cameos from the original cast, I recognized them the second I heard them speak.

I get that they wanted to give Halle more of a chance to sing, and add more songs to the film, but I didn't like that Ariel sung songs in her head whilst she had no voice.

I also wasn't a fan of the CGI, specifically the underwater scenes. The hair and its movement was great, however everyone's skin looked completely dry, and because there were no air bubbles or ripples on their skin, it took me out of the underwater fantasy.

I thought Ursula and King Triton being siblings was a weird addition, as was Prince Eric being adopted, and whilst I understand why they made Scuttle a gannet instead of a seagull, changing the breed of Prince Eric's dog was unnecessary.

All my favourite songs were there, with some new ones too. I loved 'Part of your world' and I got goosebumps towards the end with the vocal choices Halle made. I was also surprisingly impressed with Jonah Hauer-King's singing voice in 'Wild uncharted waters', and I'm glad he got one of the new songs. It was amazing.

It's not a perfect film, but it's a worthy addition and holds up well amongst the other live action Disney classics."

"Haven't been a fan of the live actions but this one's definitely hit special.Disneys great Live Action Comeback!

I'm a guy and brought the family( two am daughters and a son) and they and I loved it.

Very exciting and action packed. A few scenes were really dark but not too bad for the kids.

A very emotional film too. I'm not one for these types(mermaids) but it was done really well. Ursula did a great job and so was Ariel, another beautiful young lady with a beautiful voice!

I recommend this film for the whole family. Funny, sad, dark, action. And what's great it's for the most part it stuck true to the original story. A few new songs from Lin and well worth it.

I will definitely be buying this on stream."

"Under the sea is not that bad at all. Sebastian carried this movieSo yea the rumors are true and false

False that this is a bad movie cause those who are saying this is a good movie are not wrong.

A well made rendition of a cartoon classic. The Little Mermaid is made not just for kids but for those with a heart of a kid as well. I wasn't expecting I'd be enjoying this as much as I would but I was wrong.

One of the amazing things they did in this adaptation is that they did not solely focus the story on Ariel but every character got their time to shine. To be honest if it wasn't for Sebastian, I might have a different review on this. To me, he carried this movie. The emotions and the love story wasn't felt forced, it was well executed. Kudos to Halle Bailey for her amazing performance and to Javier Bardem, didn't expect that Blackbeard has a heart for her daughter(s) at all.

Thank you Rob Marshall for this adaptation, from POTC On Stranger Tides to this. And to those who haven't watched it, watch it. Like my boss said, ""It's worth your penny""

8/10 for me. The song Part of your World was not overused. But man I love Under the Sea 🤣 🦀

#thelittlemermaid deserves all the compliments it can get. Hope it continues to do well in the big screen."
"You can see it onceOriginal story is unfair but beautiful. Self-sacrifice is not always humiliation.

The new story has a very bad picture. The underwater scenes are terrible. Ariel is not visible against the background of the seabed. Fish and birds are too natural, do not understand their emotions.

The prince is depicted as a complete fool. The mermaid learned to do everything better than him in three days.

Acting is unnatural. Some of the emotion on Ariel's face frightened my child. Ariel is supposed to be beautiful, not intimidating.

Vanessa is beautiful. In the end, my daughter asked for a toy Vanessa and I agree with her.

It is all what you must know about this movie."
"Disappointed Disney FanTo be honest, the live action remakes have been hit or miss. For every hit like Beauty and the Beast there have been misses like Dumbo. The Little Mermaid remake unfortunately falls in the later category. It fails to recapture the magic of the original. The newly added material is jarring, especially the sing by Aquafina. The CGI is weird...the realistic CGI animals are creepy...the child I was with didn't like them, ""the crab is scary"". Everything is dark and muted. I don't agree with those complaining about the casting. All of the actors were fine. Some were better than others, especially when comparing it to the original, but nothing was distractingly bad. I just feel it could have been done better."
Love itIt was very good! It's for the kids like most Disney films..they were entertained. The negative reviews are based on foolishness. For me as an adult Disney films has always been a hit or miss with me because I only went to entertain my kid. Every now and then one would luck up an be entertaining to me. Like the one martin Lawrence about the bear .. I never thought I would be in there laughing my butt at that movie but it was funny and he made a 2nd one. But back to this movie .. I love the graphics and the acting was good the characters were a little different which to me made it better..I wouldn't do a comparison..just go with the mind set of seeing a Dio movie and enjoy.
"YAWNDisney needs to stop making live actions... they are all just horrible. Leave the original to be the only movie. Why remake this and change all the authenticity of it? The movie was dark and gloomy, nothing like the cartoon was. First of all, why change all the songs? The lyrics were fine just the way they were. If you don't care to keep the movie like the original then just don't remake it. Ruining the songs, ruining all the characters, ruining the color, animation, I could go on and on for hours! I would not recommend this movie to any kid, as it is just not good over all. Just no disney, no no no."
"Overall a better live action remake than manyHalle Bailey's voice was fantastic. Whatever acting lines were ""by the number"" were made up for in the emotion she conveyed in the music. I did miss the big opening number for King Trident and his daughters, it seemed more like a pre-planning meeting than a once a year ceremony/celebration. I also wish they would have done the crab cooking scene, and given us a longer version of Ursula's demise. Prince Eric was as dreamy as ever, and I enjoyed the animal voice actors. I thought the animation/CGI was very well done; it felt pretty natural despite being mermaids under the sea. I felt that the change in setting was a good choice, it helped make casting choices make sense, it didn't feel shoe horned in. Overall, I would enjoy watching it a second time."

"Absolutely Adored!What a beautiful adaption of the Little Mermaid. The story stayed true, characters were chosen perfectly, and the visuals were outstanding.

It is a movie for my generation to continue watching and feel nostalgic about our childhood. Hailey did an amazing job and she is the ""Little Mermaid"".

The cameo from Jodi Benson was placed in the right moment (almost made me jump out of my seat).

Some of the back story add ons were perfect. Erics past allowed us to feel sympathetic towards him and his kingdoms ordeals gave us a ""why"".

Melissa McCarthy as Ursula was spot on. The songs, her tentacles, even her transformation back when grabbing ariel was done perfectly!

I have nothing to add to this film, just that the writers, producers, casting crew, and visual production did a superb Job! 👏🏽"

"Not everything is what it seems...It has been a lot of controversy with this movie, so I decided to give it a try. Honestly, this movie lacks of its original magic. The changes to the story might seem simple, but basically changes the plot a lot. The casting as much as I wanted to be wrong, it's all over the place and not the best casting. Halle's voice its extraordinary and we can't deny that, but her acting skills are poor. Mellisa McCarthy did an amazing job portraying Ursulla the sea witch. Daveed Diggs also created a great Sebastian! He has an amazing voice and made his character unforgettable.

About the new songs, some fit pretty well, and some others like Prince Eric's song was just too much. Those extra 20 - 30 mins the creators wanted to add where unnecessary. The plot worked by itself like it was, specially the end of the movie."
"Beyond GorgeousThis is Halle Bailey's film. She's absolutely beautiful, charismatic, and has the voice of an angel. It's not just a shot-for-shot remake; the film makes this classic story fun and fresh with new songs and character development. Ariel is much more of a fighter this time around; new songs are added to enhance what certain characters are feeling; and the underwater sequences are immersive. Who knew Melissa McCarthy could sing? She was so impressive as Ursula. My only complaint is Awkwafina as Skuttle. She was the weakest voice actor, even though she's such a strong actress. The actress who played Vanessa was beautiful and deserved more than 10 minutes of screen time. All in all it's a beautiful film with powerful performances, especially from Halle and Melissa. It's a total A+ Go see it in 3D if you can!"
"A Sinking Ship: 1-Star Disaster""The Little Mermaid"" live-action adaptation sinks to unimaginable depths. With excessive length, visually dark and unappealing aesthetics, disappointing character designs for Scuttle, Flounder, and Sebastian, lackluster music, and subpar CGI, this film fails to capture the enchantment of the original. The dim visuals lack the vibrant allure, while the character designs lack charm and fail to resonate with audiences. The rearranged music lacks energy and emotion, leaving us longing for the original compositions. The CGI-rendered creatures lack grace, resembling cheap animations. This sinking ship strays far from the magic of the animated classic. Save yourself the disappointment and stick with the timeless charm of the original ""The Little Mermaid."""
"Probably the best live-action adaption everWhat a marvelous movie !

This is the best live-action adaptation of a Disney ever done so far, even though the bar was very high with Aladdin.

Halle Berry is delivering an Oscar-deserving performance, maybe the best female act seen in years. This was so emotional I wanted to cry, cry with no reason, not like in Encanto because some story was reflecting on our own experiences, but simply because it was emotionally intense, beautiful, marvelous. Sisters and brothers, there's nothing about race and skin colour, it's all about love, beauty and art, and Disney has succeeded in this demonstration while it often over-manufactured diversity in some cases in recent years.

The pictures are of extreme beauty, and I'm adding the 10th stars because it's so funny both for kids and grown ups, and the musics are a hit.

Please don't listen to negative people who are using excuses for their lost soul.

My favorite movie of 2023 so far, and from now it's in my top most loved movies ever and one that I'll re-watch again and again with delight."
"Save it for an airplane.Or just watch the cartoon. Same movie, much better. This movie is dull (CG is terrible) and every character created in the first one is less likable.

I don't understand with all the amazing books written in the world why we need yet another remake. Adapt a book, write an original, do something different.

The other big issue with current movies is they all subscribe to the same boring formula....you can predict exactly when the next action set piece will come, the next comedic beat, the next moment of drama. It's all for a brain dead public that is just sitting there numb and mostly bored but barely entertained enough not to walk out."
"Good but not as good as the Classic.I watched the original in the cinema when it was released and it is still my favourite Disney classic of all time! I took my children to watch this live action remake and we had a wonderful time overall! I really appreciated the parts of the script that were kept the same and the songs! I loved Halle Bailey's interpretation of Ariel and I especially thought Ursula was impressive and imo Ursula's character was the closest to the original and possibly improved! Maybe...

I agree with the many reviews that feel that the animal sidekicks didn't quite hit the mark. Appreciating that I am a 41 yo full of nostalgia and love for the classic I asked my kids - they felt that Flounder was unnecessary and forgettable - which is a shame because in the original Flounder is Ariels best friend and he is such a delight yet unfortunately the special friendship didn't come across in the remake. Scuttle was annoying - weird decisions made here. Sebastian was the best of the 3 but even his personality had been flattened somehow. King Triton was OK - again for a live action version his character was less alive than the animations. How is this possible??

I MIGHT watch it again and I am generously giving it an 8 because if I put my nostalgia aside it was a great film and I even got some chills! Im unlikely to ever top the hundreds of times Ive watched the classic!"
"Grim reaper to a classicFirst of all, The CG was laughable. The whole mood seemed like it was a set in a horror movie. It was so dark and gloomy and depressing...and the CG characters looked horrifying enough to give little kids nightmares. The storyline seemed awkward and forced, and some songs/ singers literally gave us headaches. Acting was sub par as well, especially in important scenes when ariel looked like she was about to go to war with eric instead of falling in love. I really wanted to love it like B&B or Aladdin... but unfortunately it fell short in every aspect. I personally think that the director's vision was too limited and not very creative. The carribean beats and the festive atmosphere were all cut out, and instead became sullen & depressing... It was worst remake I've seen in awhile and i would not recommend it."
Not what we expected.I grew up with the animated Little Mermaid and I couldn't wait to take my kids to see it. My two daughters and son loved the animation so I was so sure they would love this live action movie. At first they sat and ate their snacks and all was great but within 30 mins my 8 yr old began to look around soon followed my 10yr old and then my 11 yr old. Within 40 mins they wanted to go see something else. I won't lie I also wanted to like this but I to have to admit I was bored as well. It just didn't have the magic I remember the animation one having and was left very disappointed. If you are wanting to relive the magic from the original then this won't be the same. Pull out the Apple TV and watch Little Mermaid the animation one. The original is by far the best one and in fact my kids just yesterday watched the animation one while eating lunch and loved it.
"AMAZINGGGGGGGGGGMy daughters cried!! Halle did the character justice! Good job to the cast and crew! 👏👏 went into the movie with big expectations, and they were met. From the beginning of the movie to the end. I applaud Disney for taking a chance on this extremely talented young lady, despite the potential back lack it would receive from bitter people around the world. I don't see who else they could have casted for this role. She has such an amazing energy and phenomenal voice. If you want to have a nice date night with your man/woman I definitely recommend coming to see the new Live Action Little Mermaid!!

Her voice will take you to a new place you've never imagined. I felt like a kid again in the theaters. It was a really amazing moment for me and my family. 10/10!!!!"
"They triedThis movie was just not able to pull the magic from the original film. Needed more Color, the sea animals had no expression and they cut the crab and chef scene. The bird rapping was really bad!! They tried to make some changes to the original but those changes were mostly made things awkward or worse. Halles voice is amazing and definitely the best part of the movie she did great and definitely deserves credit for being best part of this movie. Especially with how hatful some people have been toward her being cast as the little mermaid. Sebastian and flounder are creepy looking and I know that's how fish look but it's fantasy give us some friendly looking funny sea creatures.

3 stars."
"Ariel is mesmerizingFirst off, Halle Bailey was captivating!! She was so beautiful as Ariel, and her voice was a true siren call. The visual effects in this movie were astounding. My eyes could not look away from the big screen for a second! The vibrant colors made me giddy! Every character in this movie were perfect! Melisa McCarthy was hilarious and scary at the same time. The whole theater I was in gave this movie a standing ovation. I have to go back to Bailey, she owned the Ariel character like it was written all those years back just for her! This movie hits every emotion possible. Sebastian and Flounder were so funny and cute, along with Scuttle! The rapping done by Awkwafina was awesome! The big shark in the beginning was scary! And my heart filled with love at the end! Best Disney remake yet!"
"Disappointing in so many waysI tried to keep an open mind for this movie, even with all the changes they made from the original. Unfortunately, it's hard to overlook the design choices made for a majority of the characters, especially for Sebastian and Flounder. Don't even get me started on ""Scuttlebutt"" because it was horrific and I actually really enjoy Lin Manuel Miranda's lyrics/music. After growing up watching the original The Little Mermaid as well as the prequel, sequel, and television shows it was disheartening to see the changes made to Ariel's personality and her iconic red hair. Halle Bailey is beautiful and has an amazing voice, however as a redhead myself, I would have preferred authenticity and an actual redhead been cast as Ariel. Feeling like you don't belong and being different from everyone else was incredibly relatable as a redhead myself growing up, I disliked how her character was portrayed instead in this movie. After waiting several years for this movie to come out it most definitely was not worth the wait and all I can say is at least it was slightly better than Pinocchio."
"THE LITTLE MERMAID - A PERFECT LIVE ACTION REMAKE!The Little Mermaids was a great film. With astonishing visuals and musical numbers, the film highly exceeds expectations.

Critics forget the target audience is young children, yet they expect the film to suit their ADULT brains, when any film being remade would never satisfy them.

The Little Mermaid was perfect. Halle Bailey was magnificent in the role. The directing was amazing.

The only slightly negative review I'd give, is that Halle Bailey should've been given more lines/internal monologues when her voice is taken away from her. It's a great twist on the original, having her sing inside her head, with that being established, it would've been great to have her speak internally."
A really bad remakeI almost fell asleep twice... Hailey Bailey has a beautiful voice but the acting part not so much...Each scene felt rushed and lacked the magic of the cartoon...Eric and Arial had Zero charisma and what did they do to poor Sebastian... They changed some of the songs and took out the scene with the cook Ariel's father looked rediculous and so many scenes were dark...If there is one thing I enjoyed was when Ursula is transformed ..but that didn't last very long .. No I'm sorry Disney this was very poorly done and I hope you learn from your mistakes and stop putting out remakes. .Give us sth original Sorry 1 star from me it wasn't worth my time or money.
"DisappointingI was going into this movie with high hopes to prove everybody else wrong but I ended up with nothing but disappointment. Bluntly said, this movie is just a lazy remake that fails to capture the magic of the original. Waste of a Disney classic and definitely a waste of time. I had hoped to at least feel some kind of empathy or relatability towards any of the characters, but somehow they feel poorly written and with no sign of anything fresh to add to the classic. Simply put, it's a copy and paste job but the catch here is this movie is nowhere near as good as its predecessor. Wouldn't recommend if you value your time."
"Halle Bailey Jonah Hauer-King are adorable.This whole movie was adorable. Prince Eric and Ariel were so perfect, I was so invested. I didn't find Ariel relatable in the cartoon, but I did here, Eric too. I loved this movie. It was enough like the original, and I enjoyed the changes made (the animal friends could have looked better, but I felt they were well casted.) I liked the lyric changes, I'm not sure why the opinion there is so divided, I think consent is cute, and it didn't wreck the song at all. This movie was great, and not just for a remake, it was great for a movie. I liked this more than the cartoon, that's my opinion, sorry to super nostalgic people."
"DisappointingThis movie has none of the charm or magic of the original. The atmosphere is dark, the acting is terrible, the music is awful, and the most memorable parts have been changed to fit unclear narrative.

What a disappointment. Disney movies were always quite simple in terms of story, but good music and superb performances by actors usually were exemplary. This time is different.

Oh well.

It's not worth your time or money. The movie lacked any real substance and failed to deliver on its promise of being a family-friendly film. It's unfortunate that the filmmakers didn't put more effort into creating a better movie."
"My fav Live Action - BY FARThe Little Mermaid was the first movie I saw in a movie theater, I remember that day as one of the best of my life, I'm also a Disney's fan, and I was in doubt about this remake, as I don't like a lot the ones they made so far..... This is the only Live Action where the differences from the OG movie are perfect. The music, the acting, the effects, how the Caribbean is showed... everything... definitely will see it again in Disney+ (something I don't do with any of the other Live Actions). They managed to make a different movie, with the same sentiment. And Halle KILLED IT in the role! She felt like Ariel since the first second of the movie. PURE love from my side."
"Underwhelming Under the SeaEvery now and again, Hollywood blesses us with a remake so mind-numbingly unnecessary that we're left questioning our own reality. The Little Mermaid remake is the latest cul-de-sac in the circuitous route of creativity where, apparently, we've started recycling things that should have been left in the bin.

I have seen brighter colors on a rainy Monday morning than in this movie. The 'visuals' feel like the team ordered a palette from '50 Shades of Drab' instead of diving into the vibrant, undersea wonderland that the original animated film offered us. The title might as well have been, ""The Little Mermaid: Unleashing the Power of Sepia.""

Now, let's talk about music. Oh, the music. I never thought I would miss the sound of a singing crab so much. The reworked songs seemed to have been passed through a creative paper shredder and then pieced back together by someone who only vaguely remembered the tune. And the Scuttle song? It felt like an auditory equivalent of a tax audit.

In what felt like an aggressive act of cinematic filibustering, the film's extended runtime added about as much value as a screen door on a submarine. Each new scene was like watching paint dry. Except the paint was already dried. And the color was boring.

And then there was the casting. The characters were about as dynamic as a bowl of overcooked linguini. The emotional depth ran from A to B. It was like watching a high school play, where everyone is trying their best, but you can't shake off the feeling that something's just not quite right.

The Little Mermaid remake is a spectacular testament to the concept of 'Just because you can, doesn't mean you should.' But hey, at least we now know that even mermaids can have a bad day."
"Fun time, better than originalThis is not a perfect movie plot/art wise but this is a perfect movie to enjoy. It stayed true to the original while fixing the OG's plotholes and giving more characterization and backstory. The casting was perfect, the music was beautifully done, and many of the CGI underwater scenes were so pretty. This story gave Ariel and Eric reasons to relate to each other and fall in love, it builds way more relationship between them. You see their personalities shine through and there are so many moments of actual logic, I love it. We may not have needed a live action Little Mermaid (ngl how Sebastian looked may end up in a nightmare or two but thats just me) but I'm very glad we have it. From all of the little girls first experiencing the Little Mermaid to the old folks like me who saw the first in theaters, this is such a fun movie to watch."
"ScuttlebuttMelissa McCarthy makes it worth 2-3 stars but that scuttlebutt song scuttles the movie. Predictable story since it's a re-make or re-imagining as people have said. Don't waste your money it'll be on Disney+ soon enough.

Jodi Benson does have a quick appearance which is pretty cool if you are into Disney Easter eggs. (Original voice of Ariel)

The CGI is pretty good at times and others it's pretty bad. You have the floating head affect at times and the lighting is weird but that's somewhat to be expected with a movie taking place under water and the lighting issues.

My six and ten year old thought it was ok and said Mario was better."
"Damp FlipperI found the songs underwhelming and some even annoying. The movie seemed awfully dark, mixed in with the sea creatures looking frighteningly artificial and janky, making this movie an unhappy experience for my two Daughters, who both became increasingly bored the longer the film went on and it did go (On and on and on) on too long. Disney seem to be prioritising the amount of content they release these days, not quality, which is a real shame. Ariel actress Halle Bailey, did a very professional job on the singing side, but the reimagined script didn't do her any favours, but on saying that, I don't see her picking up an Oscar any day soon. Overall a massive letdown and a wasted opportunity, by a once beloved company, who seem determined to push its key demographic away."
"I was not expecting this...Okay, I loved the animated version of The Little Mermaid, and since the Peter Pan and Wendy live action was extremely disappointing, I didn't have high expectations for this one, but oh boy, all of the casting choices were amazing! The songs were incredible, especially the new one named For the First Time, everyone in their roles were amazing, some of the only problems I have with the acting is that Melissa Mcarthy didn't feel that intimidating in some of the scenes, but she was still good. (But if you have seen the ending, oh my gosh, that's where she does it best)

Here are some of the problems I have with it: The animals, Sebastian looks like they tried to make him realistic, but then someone else made him look a bit animated, and that led to some weird eyes, and Flounder just looks like a regular fish, (Almost all of the other fish looks like that) so it looks weird when he talks in a child voice. Scuttle looks fine actually. Some of the scenes just looks a bit weird, and feels a bit too long, or you can't see what they're doing properly. But that's it with the problems I have.

Other than that, this is my favorite Disney Live Action so far! I also like some of the new story for it, but I wont spoil it if you wanna see it. But after I have said all of this, do I recommend it? Yes! A hundred percent."
"Disappointing and flatJust okay, overall it was disappointing. The CGI was not great either, some of the characters looked so creepy. Halle can sing, so that was positive. The colorful scenes were pretty too. But, it was still just okay and not great, the kids were a little bored too. It could be worse, it could have been a lot better. Or, Disney could just work on new content as opposed to these live action remakes. Honestly this pales in comparison to the original, the original was so magical and fun and long lasting. It's a classic. This remake is just a remake! In a year it will be forgotten! Do better Disney!!"
"I don't think they could've chosen anyone better to play ArielThe way her voice and personality is the perfect fit for Ariel!!! The movie was great, a lot of people complained about the lighting of the movie but I think that made it way more realistic. Additionally the CGI was very good, in the trailer it looked a bit off but when watching it in the theatre's it looks so much better. The songs were amazing and the storyline was great too, there was some parts missing from the original but other than that I loved it and felt emotional watching it. Overall it's great and you won't waste your time watching it, I think people are trying too hard to have a problem with this movie."
"Not my arielDisney.. i dont know why u didnt listen for critic.. its holiday in my country.. but not many people going to watch the film??

Maybe many of us dissappointed.. and cgi doesnt looked good after watch avatar!! Aladdin is more better than this!! Im sory to say.. but mermaid is the worst disney live action movie 😭😭😭

I know it is a different genre and not to be compared to the original, but even watching with expectations of a fresh take on the story wasn't enough to keep me interested.. im broken hearth to see, one of my favorit disney princess became like this.. u failed to delivered it beautifully and magical like a cartoon."
"I loved itI went to go watch the move last night and it was one of the best disney live actions ive seen everyone who played in it was perfect for parts it was a really cute movie definitely good for all types of ages to watch halie bailey was probaly one of the most perfect ariels there could've been they did a good job making it like the orginal movie. They changed up the song a little bit on the kiss the girl scene but that scene was really cute and i actually really liked the switch in the song.so yeah, if your looking for a new movie to watch it should definitely be the little mermaid i had the best time watching it."
"Not what you thinkI took a chance and saw this movie. I didn't care about all of the prior reviews and the negativity surrounding the movie. Ariel was my favorite Disney princess so I was so excited to see this movie. However, I did not enjoy this remake, which broke my heart. What really got me was the lack of color and magic that the original had. Again, I don't care about the cast or anything because they did great. Also, changing the lyrics of the original songs and taking out Les Poissons was a bit of a stretch. Overall, I was generally disappointed, which is something that I didn't want to encounter at all. Give me this cast and remake it, sure let's do it! I feel they have great potential."
"It's not a live action, it's a new movieI will start this review saying that it's a new mermaid's movie.

They create and defend the fact that Halle Bailey was amazing and she was the best option for Ariel. Sorry.... She is amazing and the best option for a MERMAID only. This movie wasn't a live action of a little mermaid. They change EVERYTHING. The creatures don't have the same essence of the first movie, Ariel doesn't have emotions, they change a lot of the real movie (the end, the songs, the colorful) because they want to defend ""the patterns"". So they create a new movie about the Little mermaid! Again... It's not a live action.

The movie is good.

Is a long movie for children, the songs are good, Halle is amazing as singer, Javier and Melissa are amazing on their characters. They put a lot of energy.

Jonah was meh... A lot of marketing, for a little content."

"Average screenplay & story with some stunning VISUALS..I would say this is disney best product of this year. The Little Mermaid delivers what the film has promised. It has grand visuals that will delight you and make your day and the story of mermaid justifies a watch. HALLE BAILEY shines throughout the film and the musical performance of hers was a worth watch and she is a perfect casting I would say. Storyline is basic about a mermaid who is desperately want to discover the human world and when she does what the circumstances that she has to suffer. It's not that unique of a storyline but it's a decent one. But the screenplay could've been shortened as there are a lot of scenes where movie seems to be stretched out little bit and climax was very average because of the lack of the villain. You have a decent story but if you don't have a proper villain your story isn't completed and that is one of the major problems facing all the disney fantasy films. They off to a good start but they'll end drastically. Music of this film is a top notch every song enlightens you and it's good to hear in the flow of this film. Rest of the cast is average Except Sebastian, Flounder & Scuttle these 3 are the main pillow of this film superb performance by all these characters. Little mermaid is an average watch it's not that great but still you can give a try for its visuals & performance of halle bailey......"
Well done.Loved this movie! It holds true to the original with a few minor tweaks and a little lagniappe (something extra). I found myself wanting to sing all the songs like I did as a kid. Under the Sea was visually stunning. Halle was awesome. Her voice is beautiful. The chemistry between Ariel and Eric was perfect. Ursula definitely holds your attention. Each character was well cast. The audience even applauded at the end. I definitely plan to watch this movie again. Its definitely one of the top live action remakes. Don't listen to any of the negative hype. Give this movie a chance and decide for yourself.
DisappointingI loved the classic The Little Mermaid growing up and even as an adult. I was absolutely thrilled and bought tickets in advance. It was such a let down! The acting was horrible! This is definitely not the Ariel I knew! Her singing and acting were not on par to what I had expected Ariel to be. They are nothing alike personality wise. The added songs were bland. Flounder was a little peon fish. The best part and actress was Ursula if you can get over it being played by the comedian McCarthy. It was just weirdly different and Disney has always done great at remaking but this was by far a complete disappointment and let down.
loved itLoved the cast and the music. Kids got to see an updated version of a movie that's over 30 years old. I think it was in need of an update anyway because children today have even lower attention spans and won't watch old cartoon drawings. Mine won't anyway. Glad they re did it. I know there were a lot of negative comments about the main character playing her but it was uncalled for. She did a good job. Looking forward to seeing more of her work in the future. The world is changing and it will change with or without you. They'll accept a remake of alice in wonderland and its sequels but won't accept an updated make believe mermaid. Make it make sense.
A little disappointing.Took my daughter(8) and her friend(7) to see this memorial day weekend. Kind of disappointing. It was extremely long and had dead spots that lose kids attention. Sebastian and flounder are disturbingly weird looking. About 1 hour through the kids got bored and started squirming and the movie lost there attention. Around 45 minutes later it got a little better. Funny thing is the kids gravitated to Ursula instead of Ariel. Which was weird because I the cartoon they love Ariel. The movie could have been trimmed an easy 30 minutes and been better. Live action remakes are weird but the kids wanted to see it so we went.

"Congratulations to Rob Marshall and Halle Bailey for the film The Little MermaidIn my opinion, the live action film The Little Mermaid is Disney's best live action, I've been waiting for this film since 2019, and now it's 2023 I've watched it and I really like it!!

The underwater world is so extraordinarily beautiful, all casts play a good role, The story of the film runs well from start to finish.

To Halle Bailey, thank you for playing the character Ariel so well, I don't know what it would have been like if you hadn't played it, would it have been this good? Halle, you are so beautiful, your voice is so amazing, you are worthy and you play Ariel so well.

That is all and thank you."

"Bigger Than the OriginalBeautifully done, in every single way. I didn't want it to end, and that's not a feeling I get very often.

Words cannot describe Halle Bailey. An example of how to portray innocence. It takes short seconds to fall in love entirely with her Ariel. She is the movie, and that's a marvelous point. Couldn't get enough of her, and can't wait to see her next projects.

The directing and edition here takes the film to a whole new level and makes every single scene memorable. It takes minutes to achieve a rewatch potential.

The couple's chemistry is out of this world and easily brought me to tears with simple scenes, the way it should be.

""Part of Your World (Reprise)"" and her high note moved me in a way that I don't think any other musical live action from Disney did.

The original songs are huge and very welcome. Eric's solo got me by surprise, never expected it to be so powerful (and Halle vocalizing in the background as a nod to classic mermaids? Truly mesmerizing). ""For the First Time"" is so smart lyric-wise, and happens in a moment I've always felt needed a song in the animation.

Also, my favorite 4DX experience, by far. Truly magical.

It's bigger than the original in every way, no fear in saying that."
"Not as good as expectedKind of a waste of time. Too many unnecessary changes. This, like all live animations, is just another movie that should have just been left alone. Come up with fresh ideas rather than ruining childhood classics. Isn't there enough people in Hollywood to come up with fresh ideas and storylines?? What happened to creativity.

Movie was a waste of time. Do yourself a favor and if you head to the theater, pay your way in and keep walking to the theater next door haha.

I've yet to see a live animation that I could great. Wish this could have been the one...buuuut no. It was so far from great. Sad.."
"A must see movie !!I love the little mermaid, and this was very well remade perfectly. I enjoyed this movie a lot. This movie had me tears, laughs, and smiles throughout the whole movie I enjoyed every part of it. I'll watch this movie over and over and won't get tired of it. If other people didn't like this movie, then there's something wrong with them. Every kid and every adult will enjoy this movie. Halle and Melissa McCarthy played the role very well and I really loved that. It got me singing all the songs and I was very happy. I can't wait till it comes out on Disney+ because it'll be a replay for me every day."
"still the same chauvinistic story, harmful to our youngWell, there was the fact that the cast was more diverse this time, and that was great.

Other than that, I walked out of the theatre after the movie feeling no excitement, nothing. Was it because the story didn't change? I don't think so. Cinderella was re-made and I remember it offered an excitement... Maybe it's that in ""The Little Mermaid"" (2023) characters weren't really explored. Maybe I expected more? Not sure.

Disney could have seized the opportunity to change up some things. For example, they could have gotten rid of or at least questioned the part where the prince has to ""kiss THE girl"" in under 3 days... the shotgun weddings, and why does the prince have to decide when to kiss ""the girl""?

Disney also upped the ante with longer action/thrill sequences. However I don't have that feeling that I get (like a release or satisfaction) after watching a good film.

Not good."
"Just a bad copto of the original filmI didn't like how Sebastián and flounder were presented. Not the chemistry between prince and Ariel. It was a disappointment, I believe they said it was going to be a fresh perspective but it wasn't ... I think only with Vanessa they hit the knot, she was like the original character and an excellent performer. The visuals were not my favorite. Looked like the king trident was powerless and didn't show how majestic he was like in the film. This Ariel was not my favorite, she looked disoriented all the time. Not quite sure why Disney continues to recreate bad remakes of their histories. They could have created a whole new visual world for the protagonist..."

"I didn't hate it, but....Took my daughter to see this and I realize I'm not the target audience, but these are my honest thoughts. I think my daughter was more critical of the movie than I was.

These live action movies just can't hold the same magic as Disney animation. You can't do realism and have your animals talk. Without facial expressions, it looks wierd and is a distraction from the story and acting. Sabastian and Flounder were hard to watch. Scuttle was a little better for some reason but the gender change annoyed me. The rap song Scuttle did was the worst part of the movie. The extra songs they added felt uneeded. Ursila didn't have the smoky voice that she should have. Although Melissa McCarthy dose her best she is just not quite there. The new Hollywood rule that a woman can't be saved by a man is tiresome.

The scenes on land being in a Caribbean setting felt more organic to me. Eric being an adopted prince seemed a bit of a stretch though. When the animals weren't talking, the ocean settings and creatures were beautifly done. The actor for Ariel did great and had a great voice. I really liked her, but in the back of my mind I couldn't get past the changed to her appearance. That just wasn't Ariel."
"Only cried twice, haha!First I gotta start by saying I saw the cartoon in theaters when I was 2 so these characters and this music have been with me literally my whole life.

The music brought tears to my eyes again and again. They did an absolutely fabulous job reworking them. The new songs were jarring but (as with Aladdin) I'm sure they will grow on me. The visuals were stunning! Love love loved the designs of the mermaid fins. Absolutely gorgeous.

I wasn't immediately sold on Melissa McCarthy (Titus Burgess still being my dream cast there) but she was fabulous! Halle was wonderful. And having to perform half the movie silent while still portraying those emotions? Bravo! It's my first time seeing Jonah (and since Eric is my oldest love, the shoes were big to fill) and I enjoyed his performance. Also now there's a real actor to focus on and my weird cartoon character crush can take a backseat, haha!

Best change was removing the ""I'm sixteen, I'm not a child anymore"" line. It's gets cringier and cringier the older I get. A+ edit Disney.

My only wishes: 1) Ariel's hair. I wish that color had managed to pop a bit more. I know the daughters all have more realistic looks but I found myself missing it.

2) that they had included fewer of the original lines of dialogue. The '89 version is perfection of course but changing more lines (as they did with Aladdin) would have made it just that much more fresh. Same plot just not same screenplay.

Can't wait to go see it again!"
"Not worth itAbsolute ship wreck of a movie that doesn't deserve half the hype that it has generated. The original was meh and this one lacked anything to lift it beyond the legacy of its 1989 counterpart. In general, I'm a fan of remakes that actually add substance to the originsliry of the storyline, so the fact that this was a remake didn't say my decision in any way. I do think that Hollywood and Disney may be running out of original ideas and that's may be why they have been hitting the remake button so hard. I did also hear that Disney plans on remaking all cartoon versions into live action movies. In a word---DON'T!"
"Outstanding!The Little Mermaid was a beautiful movie both visually and sonically! The message that love always wins permeated throughout the film! Take your family and friends to the theaters to see it! No one who believes in the power of love will leave disappointed!

A few things that I particularly enjoyed are as follows:

1. Ariel and Ursula played their roles with extraordinary passion and powerhouse vocals.

2. The Prince had me convinced of his love for Ariel and the King, Ariel's dad, did also. Both were devoted to her and valued her presence and existence in their lives.

3. The message of letting go and being brave enough to sacrifice for those that you love was also powerfully interwoven into the fibers of this movie. It's hard to let go, but easy to do so in the name of love!"

"Expectations CrushedOkay I'm a HUGE Little Mermaid fan saying this, don't waste your money.

I was looking for a cheerful colorful magical viewing experience, but it was dark gloomy and grim.

As a movie fan in general, the CGI and editing was awful. It felt rushed.

No magic at all.

It's just a fact, nothing is better than the original classics. Especially when it comes to live action remakes and changes to the classic story lines that made the original a classic in the first place.

Disney movies used to be a way to escape from the ""real world"". Taking us to happy magical places. We need more of that in this day and time."
"Surprisingly good!!The little mermaid was always one of my favourite childhood movies, and so I wasn't holding out too much hope for this remake (we all know how Pinocchio and Dumbo went). But I have to say, that was actually really, really good! The cinematography was gorgeous, the costumes and setting was beautiful, the CGI was really quite good (a bit off in some places, especially with the sisters).

The casting was amazing! Halle Bailey did an awesome job, and Jonah Hauer King was an awesome Eric. I really also loved how they expanded Eric and Ariels relationship as it made their romance seem that much more special. I also loved how they were shown as similar by having Eric have his own treasure trove sort of room in the castle!!

I hated The Scuttlebutt but I'll just skip that if I watch it again.

Overall, I would give it an 8/10 as I personally really enjoyed it however the cgi was a tad off in places, the shots in the ocean were amazing but gave me a tiny bit of motion sickness, and the scuttlebutt defo lost it points (someone needs to make Lin Manuel Miranda pay for that lol, it was foul)"

"Another classic Disney movie for the record booksVery well made movie. In fact, I think even better than the original. And I think this live action will appeal to more adolescent and grown-ups. Another job well done by Disney. I'm looking forward to all of the other live action remakes. This one definitely goes above and beyond. It was beautifully made and will be a classic forever.

Some of the negative reviews say it is not as childlike as the original. And that may be true. But Disney is not just for children. Many adolescents and grown-ups enjoy Disney's just as much if not more. If the negative reviews are because it's not childlike enough, then the children can always watch the original cartoon version. But this version appeases way more people than the original."
Stop with the remakes pleaseThis is just plain bad Disney is just doing these remakes for the money. And come on what they did to flounder scuttle and Sebastian I mean can they look any creepier. It's so dreary there's no color to the film. And Halle acting is just sub par at best and awkward At times. Her singing is beautiful but her acting eh. Also I can't stand the actor who plays Eric. Everything about this is just bad do yourself a favor if you want to watch this DONT instead vo watch the animated original you'll be much happier. Disney just needs to get it through their head that these soulless remakes will never work. Think about it when's the last remake they did that got great reviews?
"Another great Disney live action remake!I'm a little confused with all of the weird reviews on IMDb. Maybe the people were having a bad day? My kids and I had a blast and so did most of the people around us in the movie theater. It's an event! The little mermaid is one of our favorite all-time Disney's, next to beauty and the beast. We are so grateful that they decided to make a live action remake. We are going again this weekend with a birthday party, and I honestly have to say that I'm excited to see it again as a 53-year-old mom. Somethings are just magical. Well done by everyone. Definitely worth seeing on the big screen. Melissa McCarthy was a pleasant surprise, and the main actress who played Arielle, the little mermaid, was phenomenal. Truly a talent to keep an eye on. She is going places!"
"Not worth the money, just wait until streaming.I wanted to like it, but it was so lazily done. The ""underwater"" scenes were so fake looking. Avatar 2 did a better job of this. Hell, even Aquaman underwater scenes looked better. Melissa McCarthys role was well done, that's about the only positive part of the movie. The actress for Ariel seemed like a talented singer, but who knows if they used auto tune like in the beauty and the beast live action. Aerial and prince Eric didn't have any chemistry. You could literally tell they're just two actors there to do a job.

The songs were just not what the animated film delivered. I'd recommend waiting until this comes to streaming services."
"Bad actingI couldn't help but notice the lack of chemistry between the two main characters. It is crucial to remember that this is a movie, not merely a music video, and in order for the narrative to captivate the audience, the actors must possess exceptional acting skills. Therefore, it is evident that Halle, one of the main characters, should make significant efforts to enhance her acting prowess. Jessica was a highlight, she stood out in her role, it left me longing for her character to have more screen time.

Both main characters lack something that fails to satisfy me. When comparing this live-action adaptation to the 1989 cartoon, I still find myself leaning towards the cartoon."
"What an amazing live action Disney movieWhat an amazing live action Disney movie

Just went to see Little Mermaid. It was such a great movie. The visuals were great, casting was amazing and it was so nice to see that the story line was the same as the cartoon.

This child in me was very happy.

The regular movie was sold out so we had to watch it in 3d. Which was also nice.

I would just advise to check your 3d glasses as mine were not great. But the rest was perfect.

The songs were super fun, the movie not to short or to long. Overall such a wonderful experience and would recommend it to everyone regardless of age.

Especially if you have seen the cartoon."
Worst movie everWorst movie ever : s not just the casting with no chemistry but the cgi of the animal and that creepy voice.... No. The picture was too dark and the story was too much. I hope the other one disney remakes gonna be more creative and better. I hope they gonna make greater and more original movie than this. Its already told boring and i dont like the modernization of it. Just make new creative movies please. It was so long ago when disney came out with a good movie. I hope its gonna change in the future. I am a big disney fan but these remakes dont buy me sorry. I always give them a try but always dissapointed.
"I really liked itSo much hate on here it's insane. It was way better than the lion king remake for sure. I loved the story and the actors chosen. Not a huge fan of remakes but this one I got teary eyed like 7 times Just so happy. My kid and 4 friends went with us (all 10) and they loved it. Halle was AMAZING. I loved the sisters of aerial being from Different oceans and all different ethnicities, that was great. Sebastian was so cute and a great voice. The sea witch as a woman was beautiful and also played a great evil woman. People need to calm down, great movie and again, Halle was bomb.com amazing!!!!!!!!!!"
"What was Disney thinking...Terrible just terrible, my daughters favourite Disney movie of all time growing, and Disney have gone and ruined it, it's a disaster from start to finish.

The acting is poor to atrocious, embarrassing really, the glitchy CGI the same, the singing was ok, however unfortunately Halle Bailey has not been blessed with the ability to act, atleast not as the role of Ariel, the confusing contradicting storyline makes no sense, and all in all it is not at all what we were expecting.

The lead casting role of Ariel was under whelming and a soulless, disappointing performance.

We would not recommend wasting your money at the cinema and wait for it on Disney+."
"Sooo goodPlot, songs, vocals, visuals, this movie is sooo good!! Halle's vocals were insane and the Part of Your World reprise just filled me with life. Melissa McCarthy acted the hell out of Ursula, her Ursula was so amazing, she even scared me a few times. I loved Prince Eric, he looked like true royalty and the song he sang showcased the amazing vocals he has too. The whole cast did an amazing job. King Triton was cast great as well, his acting was spot on. The visuals for this movie was so cute and vibrant. The ending was one of my favorite parts of the movie. I would have to say my favorite though is Part of Your World, Halle's voice just speaks to me the whole movie. Loved itt!!"
"Souless remakeFirst of all, I am not a hater and I am also not a white person. I am Asian and that makes me a minority. I don't hate Halle Bailey, in fact, I think she has a nice voice. But that doesn't make up for the movie. It is obnoxiously, annoyingly dark. I was very excited to see the underwater world with vibrant colors but I had to endure the bland, lifeless creatures with boring colors. I don't think $250 million was worth it. Sometimes I even thought I was watching a horror movie.

The new songs are so weird. They are unrelated to the movie. The scuttlebutt song is the most annoying song I've heard this year.

The final thing that ruin this remake is the ending. It is so not magical and the color, again, is ugly beyond imagination."
"Feels like a mockery of the originalThe movies feels and looks lifeless. The colours are dull, the acting of most charcters is expressionless and it really seems like no one who knows or cares about films worked on this. The running time is completely unecessary because the parts that were added in comparison to the original are useless. I really wish I could say it improved on something but every single thing is worse. The most offensive to me is McCarthy as Ursula. She's a horrible singer who embodied nothing that made the original's Ursula such a compelling and special character. I expected nothing from this because all of the remakes were terrible, but I still ended up dissapointed."
"Little Mermaid Superfan ReviewEver since I went to see the original in 89, i have been an expert in all things Little Mermaid. I've seen the Broadway musicals. I've watched the original many times. Here is what matters.

1. This is a beautiful love story. They added just enough to make you realize why Ariel and Eric are soulmates. Eric has much more of an interesting backstory. It was very much needed and appreciated.

2. Scuttle is supposed to be annoying. Awkwafina, perfect choice. Scuttlebut rap is a homage to Lin Manual Miranda and Hamilton. If you get that, you will smile, even laugh, like me. If not, you will be miserable during that number.

3. Casting is spot on.

4. Halle Bailey was born to play Ariel, and that's saying a lot. Didn't think anyone could top Benson. She slam dunked it and then some.

5. I love to snorkel. I felt like I was snorkeling. Not having every fish and plant speak and sing during musical numbers, I thought was genius. I want to get out and snorkel again so bad now. With that said, Flounder as a soldier fish, wow, I had one follow me around in Thailand for 15 minutes. That was perfect.

6. This is nothing like any of the remakes Disney has tried with varying success. This one they got right.

Bravo !"

"Awesome MovieMy girls and I LOVED this movie! It was amazing. The little girl in me cried and the mom in me was so proud. We will definitely see this one again. I was impressed with the diversity of all the characters which made it way more realistic. The original will always be a classic, however this one is right up there with it. Sebastián, flounder and Scuttle took a little getting use to but by the second scene it sinks in. Halle and Melissa were amazing in this film. I don't think they could have found anyone more perfect than those two. The music was amazing as ever and the dance choreography was on point. Everyone did an amazing job!"
"The Little Meh-maidLet me just preface this by saying I think Halle Bailey was absolutely incredible in the role & has an incredible singing voice. Plus she is absolutely stunning! But the movie is just lacking the magic. I was so excited to see this movie with my children & when it was finished I asked my 8 year old what she thought and she said ""It was just okay"". And sadly I agree. I can't put my finger on what exactly went wrong here, but the music and the film in general just lacked something. I think maybe they should've borrowed some animators from Pixar to make the graphics a little more life-like. It was very heavy & very obvious cgi that kind of took me out of it."
"Childhood Memories: Unlocked.When I tell you the new The Little Mermaid is better than any other live action remake, you may think, ""well, that's not hard to do!"" And it's true... I haven't liked any other one. (Aladdin was pretty good and far better than it's predecessors, but none of them have been great.)

This move is so good I don't even want to refer to it as a ""live action remake"". For once, the casting was perfection. PERFECTION. They honored the original script so much it brought me back to my childhood!

Halle Bailey is complete and utter enchantment. Her purity, innocence, & feistiness all blew away the highest of expectations. I was catching my breath as I cried hearing and seeing ""Part of Your World"". Her eyes tell the story... which is one of the biggest challenges for seasoned actors. She's so young and she understood the assignment.

Javier Bradem, Melissa McCarthy, Daveed Diggs & Awkwafina... I knew they'd all be good. I had NO IDEA HOW GOOD.

And thank you, Lin-Manuel Miranda for bringing your magic and fresh look to one of the all time, most beloved Disney classics. You seemed to seamlessly blend into the team of Menken & Ashman and the music that was such a gift 30 years ago.

Please go see this film. You deserve it. Your inner child needs it. I cried 4 times and regret none of it.

I'm seeing it again on Saturday."
"A musical movie with a repeated storyI did not like the movie. It is less than normal. The story and events have been repeated for years. There is no renewal from the first minute in the movie You can easily expect all the story. It has many songs within the limits of 7 songs. There are no heroes or story . No excitement or effects.

The graphics are also not wow and not bad. A mermaid loves a human, so a witch turns her into a human, on the condition that she gives a kiss of love within 3 days A very, very old story.

I felt that I wasted a lot of time during the movie

"Cash GrabWe know WHY, they did it, get money off us, but WHY, do this. It's not good, not even average, Dumbo which was 2019, is better than this. The cast is good they do look nice, Javier Bardem as King Triton, he is good, and they can sing- mostly. The costumes and Italy, look wonderful. But the dialogue, does not work sometimes, the songs feel really weird too. Underwater scenes, they fall flat, only three work, as the visual FX is a mess. 70% of time it's bad, very bad. The creatures, they try to make them have the fun of the cartoon, but they look and move freakish, and the singing number with Sebastian (Daveed Diggs) and Scuttle,(Awkwafina), is a horror. Not worth the trip, sorry."

"Great Score / Lifeless ActingI walked into the theater with mild expectations of what Disney could do with a beloved childhood movie.

Sadly, I was unimpressed with the lack of emotion I felt from the lead characters. Even Triton felt very dull. Was it the music? Was is the acting? Disney, please explain the casting choice.

The only thing that saved the movie was the beautiful CGI and the remarkable score. I'm a sucker for some good music and Alan Menken did not disappoint. Every bit if emotion that felt real was heavily induced by the music.

If you're going to watch The Little Mermaid, only go for the music and Halle's gorgeous voice."

"Massive DisappointmentI went into the film to see for myself what all of the hype was about. I don't know how you improve on a masterpiece, but every week, they are bent on trying to remake another one. Remember the animated original with inspired songs that we all still know and love today? The ones we share with our grandchildren?

Well, this ain't it.

I don't really care if I hurt anyone's feelings here. I review film and call it like I see it. The film seemed very uninspired to me and a little off kilter. Like they wanted to do something more, but didn't quite get there. The plot seemed a little disjointed. The summary of the film says she cuts a deal to get to the surface to impress a prince. To me, Ariel was 'curious' about the prince, but did not act like she 'needed' him. Something the animated original handled really well. I very much liked the original because it was the old school formula of princes and princesses.

The songs were very unmemorable. You won't be hearing these 10 years from now. We'll never know how much of the singers were from the actors or how much was filled in by the studio. I guess it doesn't matter.

Under this new Disney leadership, it seems they're more interested in an agenda than in really good storytelling. The last 4 animated outings were complete failures to entertain. I had hoped this live action would be a return to the good old fashioned storytelling, but alas, it wasn't to be. I'd like to give it two stars, but based on my rating system, I just can't. Pass on this one. You'll be able to watch it for free in a couple of weeks. Then punch yourself in the face and ask yourself why you did in the first place."

"It flows so smoothlyTime flies. It all flows so smoothly and nicely. The movie stays very true to the original, simply seems and feels more real. Halle embodies Ariel so well it makes you question the original 😂 she's got this naive and childish thing about her that fits so well. Her singing and acting gives you literal chills and passes emotions on powerfully.

The original music is so nice and the lyrics changes are so subtle and benevolent.

I don't have anything negative to say about it. It's a new version of the story and I hope people will be opened to it and accept to be transported by it.

Ps: Eric is such a babe, someone help me."
"Magical moments but doesn't live up to the original Little MermaidI went in with hopes that it would bring the magic the original ""Little Mermaid"" brought me as a child but, in its own unique way. I was very disappointed that they did not make the film fitting for this day and age. They followed the same exact storyline as the original, but added some which made it watchable although at times I felt like the film was being dragged out with fillers.

I think they would have found much more success changing the storyline or putting a spin on it for the lovely and talented Halle Bailey to shine in. As an audience, we all deserved that change as well, especially considering the amount of build up and anticipation we felt for the film to release in theaters."
"BEAUTIFULEverything about this movie was BEAUTIFUL, the actors, the cinematography, the colour grading, the motifs, THE SINGING!!!!!!! JONAH HAUER-KING!!!!!! HALLE THEE MF BAILEY!!!!!!!!! BEAUTIFUL!!!!!!!

The chemistry between ariel and eric needs to be studied they had me twirling my hair and kicking my feet.

I'd also like to proclaim that i was a jonah hauer-king truther from the very start and he was getting flooded with comments about h*rry st*les.

""Uncharted Waters"" was a BANGER, well done & a round of applause to everyone involved in that, it made my crush on Jonah grow by tenfold.

Halle is my bbygrl and i've been a fan of hers since 2019 and i'm so incredibly proud of her like oh my god."

"Poor CGI, terrible lighting choice, subpar acting.The CGI looked amateurish often, and the dark lighting was a big mistake. The acting by Ariel and Eric was.....sufficient, but uninspiring. The 'real life' sea creature animals are just disappointing, going with this design was a major mistake by the producer and director.

Some of the songs were great, as the classics they always were, however some of the additions to the musical list were just a poor choice and forgettable. McCarthy fit her role perfectly and was the best casting choice in this entire film, but this just canxels out a wooden performance by Bardem. Overall this feels like a pointless live action remake that is Disney's standard cash grab the days, and misses even that low mark."
"A modern take to the beloved classic!The Little Mermaid captures moments from the original film and gives us new angles to scenes that we already know and expected.

Halle is wonderful as Ariel and becomes the essence of the movie. Melissa McCarthy does a very good portrayal of the sea witch. Javier Bardem falls a bit short as King Triton.

Visually many things work, and the CGI feels organic and well done except for the final battle.

There is much thats good in this film that in essence is very faithful to the animated version although with slight changes and it is easy to realize after seeing it why there are so many people saying that it is the best Live action Disney."
Not impressedI was a huge fan of the original Little Mermaid and was super excited to see this. My excitement quickly turned to disappointment. It was underwhelming and the live action movies that Disney makes don't hold up to their original masterpieces. The graphics were beautiful but that's about it. I have no idea why this has the rating it does. Trust me it's underwhelming and strays from the original storyline and what the characters stood for. I have always loved this movie because I'm a natural red head and seeing Ariel always made me feel included. I was always made fun of but watching the original made me feel like I was normal. I feel that with this movie it doesn't compare to the original in fact it seems more unrealistic to me.
"Good film for young, old and the inbetweenBerry's performance is admirable. She's clearly worked on her role extremely well because she genuinely sounds just like the animated version in both speech and singing. I was hoping it wouldn't be a shot for shot remake, but it pretty much was. There's plenty of new scenes and new songs but I paid money to see a movie I've seen 100 times before. McCarthy's Ursula was great! I'm hoping this opens up a whole new villain era for her because she nailed it. Only let down was the often awkward digital animation of the sea people's unusual parts and it was distracting enough to remind me Bardem doesn't really have a tail. I was grateful for an ever so slightly different relationship arc between the characters. It made it more interesting to watch than the animated version.

Very entertaining and absolutely worth a watch at least once. As a parent, suspect it'll be a lot more often than that though."
"Not A Very Good MovieThe original movie was a classic. This one is not. This is just a rehash of old idea. The original movie had Ariel (the mermaid) who wanted to be something she was not. The original movie had Ursula (the bad witch) a very clear bad women. The original movie had the Prince (who Ariel wants to kiss her). The new movie has nothing new. Just another failing effort to squeeze cash out of a dying franchise. The fall of Disney reminds me of the fall of the US automakers. They had a reputation for building solid, reliable cars. They sold off that reputation for short-term cash. Disney is now doing the same thing. Selling off it's reputation for short-term cash. Sadly, Disney is in decline (possibly terminal). This movie is just another data point in the fall."
"Beautifully Done, Wonderfully MadeHalle Bailey does not disappoint! Beautiful voice, beautiful cinematography! Little girls everywhere will LOVE this movie. Good entertainment and fun for children! Great family outing!! Thank you Disney! You put the best cast together and gave us another classic. Now I would have preferred a deep voice Ursula like the cartoon, but I can't have it ALL my way. I also would like a more cohesive looking sisterhood, but I get what you were trying to do. When you decide to make a Little Mermaid sequel, I would love to see Ariel's hair a fiery red. I also would like to see Daniel Brooks or Queen Latifah as Ursula ."
"Another Remake?I am not a movie critic. I am just a parent who wants to be entertained when I see a movie. That did not happen with this movie. I only saw the movie because I went with a friend and their young kids. I thought the acting was fine and I didn't care what race the actors were. I just wonder why they would want to remake this movie? Was it just for the live action portion? Ok that was nicely done but the original was a one of a kind. Made back when there was no agenda and the animation was great for back then. Are all the older animated movies going to be remade in live action? I hope not. This movie reminded me of Avatar: The Way of Water, but with singing. Call me old fashion but I don't want to the the same movie again just because it is live action."
"Lacking magic but doable adaptationThe film suffers the same as Beauty & the Beast and Lion King... they focused too much on realism that the magic just didn't hit right. Like the film is average. They're all fine overall but there's just something lacking. IF you loved BB and LK you're likely to like this movie too.

To me it's just not how when you watch the originals for the first time and your eyes are wowed though the visuals for Little Mermaid are alright tbh. The stills definitely did not do it justice! They did give good color but bordering gloomy though it's not as dark so you can see the details and such. I liked the CGI for Sebastian and Scuttle but I'm used to uncanny CGI so I understand some people's reactions to it.

Perhaps it's the grounded expressions? Jessica who played Vanessa was top with it. She had these great facial expressions that really gave the emotions. It was bordering like the cartoon tbh. Meanwhile the rest of the cast didn't do much, Halle was lacking in that department but especially with Eric.. he just looked sad all the time lmao. However, I found magic in the Cinderella adaptation which was also grounded so perhaps it's not that. Maybe it's the costumes? It was sad to see Ariel only wearing 2 outfits and not one of them was the ""wow princess royal dress"". It was giving similar to that limp yellow dress of Belle. Where's the sparkle? Where's the wow? Perhaps it's the color grading? It's not as saturated since they did keep it ""real"" which isn't all bad...I did miss Ariel's red hair especially with Ursula calling her red... I don't understand why she had the muted ginger hair? She's a mermaid! Her sister has bright pink hair why couldn't she have unmistakable red?

Halle's singing is the best of the movie. I'd say. She sounds like Ariel. And even if her acting isn't the best she does give this innocence and vibe that's very Ariel especially for the Part of Your World. That scene was just chef's kiss.

As for the love I don't know what others are saying about chemistry because I didn't see that with Jonah and Halle. They came across as friends to me. As for the changes in the story, they did fine. They gave some lift to the plot which is good. Gave some more depth to the characters. So yeah had it's ups and downs like all movies but overall not bad, but also not something I personally would rewatch."
"Absolutely AmazingThis movie is inspired by the animated film because it is not exactly a remake. It's a movie of it's own, catering to a different generation but sharing one same magical story. Halle Bailey has a magical voice that embodies Ariel and she makes this character her own. Brilliant performance by Melissa McCarthy as Ursula. The actress that plays Ursula's human disguise, Vanessa puts up a brilliant performance within the short duration. 2-3 new songs added and 2 songs from the original animated film is not included. Sebastian is hilarious and Scuttle overpowers Flounder. Go in without expecting to watch a remake and I'm sure you'll enjoy it!"

"It doesn't have the same magic as the original.The Little Mermaid is a good example of what's wrong with Disney these days (at least in my opinion) - besides some casting choices that may rise pro and contra voices (I don't care), this movie is dead like plastic. The songs are stale and uninspired, the special effects department did okay, the actors did okay, but well, the formula of Disney movies is now a walking dead corpse, too many times chewed on. But this is not only a question of modern changes to fit to the taste of zeitgeist but for a long time Disney is like a recycling factory: with every turn of the machine the product gets worse and worse, at least if you don't add something new, fresh and substantial, something creative. So my greatest complain: the music is average, the visuals are average, the story is the typical Disney blabla, the entertaining factor is rather low. A typical movie made from the construction kit branded ""Disney"". But maybe I'm just getting old and grumpy and my by age weakened eyes and heart cannot see the beauty in this, well, product."
"Best live action remake!I went to the cinema opening night with the family, everyone was excited and the film didn't disappoint, the cast were brilliant, the story was better detailed giving more substance to Ursula and Eric which was good. Hallie Bailey was brilliant as Ariel, her voice was incredible. Loved Skuttle, really funny. I would honestly recommend this film, i dont care that Ariel is black, the fact Ariel is played by a woman of colour makes no difference at all, nobody in the cinema cared, they just laughed along and enjoyed the film. Film is really colourful, new songs aswell & Melissa McCarthy is fabulous."

"Not good, not great, but not Waterworld.This movie wasn't great , and it wasn't horrible either. 3/4 of the way through my kids were asking if the movie was almost over. The movie is way too long and there were added parts in the movie that were unnecessary and un-meaningful. They just made no sense. I am not a huge fan of the original little mermaid but much of the same dialogue and songs were the same. When this movie tried to sail in uncharted territory from the original, it was just flat.

Actually , the whole movie left me pretty monotoned when leaving. I was highly disappointed in the CGI. Flounder and Sebastian were done dirty in this movie. There was also a lack of chemistry between all the characters. I felt like the ""relationship"" was forced between Eric and Ariel. My six year olds did enjoy it, but I suffered through the movie sadly. I am just hoping my girls will not want to watch this movie on repeat when it comes on Disney+."
AmazingIf you are expecting a live action remake of the whole original story this movie is not for you theres a lot of things you can see on cartoons but not in live action movies of course the originals will always be better. But in this case its a really great movie worth watching every second of it I trully recomend it to everyone but keep an open mind of reality. I would give it 100 stars if I could realy good acring and the girl who played Ariel bravooooooo i take my hat of and give u a stanving ovation she nailed it 1000% I cant wait to the blue ray release so I can ad it to my collection. WOW!
"Disappointing chemistryAriel and Eric don't seem to have a lot of chemistry, that scene on the carriage ride was no good vibes between the two.

They changed lyrics to 2 of the songs for very small reasons, there wasn't really a reason to do so.

What the heck is going on with Flounder and Scuttle? The animation was just weird for those two. I get that it's a live action so it's supposed to be more realistic but there has to be better was to do it.

Ariel doesn't have the flaming red hair, how can you call it a 'live action remake' when she doesn't have the red hair?

Not 1 star because: Ursula was fantastic vocally and Ariel's voice was good in its own way. Kudos to the singing capabilities of those two."

"Another Disney Repeat - No OriginalityAlthough it isn't the worst film I've seen, Disney really needs to come up with some original ideas. How many times are they going to repackage old films? The script seemed rather rushed and not fully hashed out, leaving me feeling underwhelmed. I wouldn't watch it again as I didn't enjoy it as much as the original version. Moreover, the lack of innovative storytelling and reliance on nostalgia made the viewing experience predictable and unexciting. It's about time Disney takes more creative risks and explores new narratives that captivate audiences and push the boundaries of imagination. While the film had its moments, it relied heavily on familiar tropes and plotlines, failing to offer anything truly groundbreaking. The characters felt like mere replicas of their original counterparts, lacking depth and complexity. Additionally, the pacing felt off, with certain scenes dragging on unnecessarily while others felt rushed. The cinematography and visual effects were impressive, but they couldn't compensate for the lackluster storyline. I longed for a fresh and imaginative take on the source material, but instead, I was presented with a mediocre rehash that failed to capture the magic of the original. Disney has a wealth of talented writers and storytellers at their disposal; it's time they give them the freedom to explore new territories and deliver truly unforgettable cinematic experiences."

"Just not visually stimulatingOkay so first it is kinda cool that the actress playing Ariel got to bring her grandfather who watched his grandfather pick cotton and was able to watch his granddaughter star in a movie. However movies are not made simply through good backstory of the actors or good intentions of a company. The cgi was underwhelming. The look of beloved characters was weird and lost their endearing quality. I would rather Flounder look like an animation and not as much like a real fish to keep that magic. The changes to the songs kinda hurt my heart and my memories of the original animated version. The movie was dark and not the bright movie it should have been. It was pretty blah and pretty boring for what it could have been. As a remake it already loses some rating with me because if you are going to redo a story it should be hands above the original and amazing. If it can't be, why bother? Would have been better to create an entirely new story instead of rehashing and rebranding a beloved classic. Between it being a remake, a live action, and the other issues noted it just really missed the mark."
"Poor CGI. McCarthy saved this movie.Melissa Ann McCarthy is one of my favorite comedy actor. She obviously saved the whole movie. She's Ursula is a crazy villain. Not only horrible but also bad ass. She's performance reminds me of a nightmare in my childhood. In my mind,Ursula is the best Disney villain ever. I really want to see a Ursula solo film directed by Paul Feige or Tim Burton. All hell the Queen Ursula!

As for Halle Bailey. I think she's not a good choice. She's good at singing ,but she is not a excellent actor. In my opinion, She's still young,and she'll make a great progress in the future.

We have Aquaman(2018) and Avatar:the way of water(2022). Both of the two film is epic. And the visuals is amazing. However,When I saw this film,the CGI just make me feel awful. What happened to Disney?"
Did not disappointThe little Mermaid was my favorite movie growing up. I knew every word. I have been waiting for Disney to remake this one. My daughter and I absolutely loved it!! Halle was a perfect choice for Ariel. Her voice is amazing. Eric is very charming and the chemistry between him and Ariel was so perfect. I loved the extra scenes they added to really show the characters falling in love. The remake is not exactly like the original. But I really like the changes they made. Melissa McCarthy as Ursula was superb. She nailed the villain I remember as a child. Couldn't even tell this movie was over 2 hours long. Disney did an awesome job redoing The Little Mermaid.
"Not a good remakeThe new Little Mermaid movie was boring and the characters were not believable. This is a remake that was far worse than the first movie. Was not impressed with the actress they chose to play Ariel. She did not act or look the part, and they could have chosen someone with a better rhythm and singing voice. In the first movie, Sebastian was great. He added a lot of comic relief, but in this movie, Sebastian just looked and acted odd. He use to be lovable, now he may traumatize kids instead of entertain them. The makers of this Movie could have done so much more with the characters. Maybe they should have just left a classic alone."
"Just Enjoy It For What It IsI LOVED the disney animated classic. It was a staple pf my childhood. And it makes me very happy to know that today's generation will have their own version, and get to create their own memories of seeing it in a theater, having the Ariel dolls, and everything else that comes from having a monumental childhood classic. I thought this movie was very well done, because I wasn't expecting Avatar level CGI. The scenes were visually pleasing, but still whimsical and childlike. I can honestly say that I would not of done the casting any differently. Halle was fantastic, and the vocals give you chills. But same for Sebastian and Ursula, who provided comic relief and witty one liners. No it's not exactly the same as the original, but that's because its a different movie. If you are somebody that is going to be snobby and elitist over a movie meant to entertain children and adults alike, then you won't like this movie. However, if you're like me and you are easily entertained and just happy to be sitting in a movie theater, then I highly recommend using your movie theater time on this movie."
"BroadwayThe stage should be Disney's aim-as illustrated by the fabulous Lion King-their reimagining of stories such as this are pure musical theatre as opposed to theatrical musical. Halle is awesome, on a stage. Jodi Benson is incomparable on film. The Soundtrack feels like an Original Broadway Cast album, not a criticism but an observation that speaks volumes to movie goers as opposed to theatre goers.

Spectacularly underwhelming result of what could have been the most amazing stage project rather than the non movie soundtrack album it has become.

Decent, in parts, excellent casting. Awesome source material. Poor/emotionless execution. Zero ambition.

Going to watch the 1989 animation now, knowing what could have become of that world..."

"Do not compare it to the original and enjoy itThere is an expectation that live action adaptations of animated films should be the same exact movie. This expectation does diminish the experience while watching the film as there are limitations in live action films that do not exist with animated films. Some of the characters do not look as they originally did because doing so would make them look less realistic or more animated. This film is best enjoyed by not comparing it to the original.

This film does a good job at being a children's story despite adults wanting it to be something more. The plot is kept very simple and easy to follow. The shipwreck scene that caused Ariel to rescue Eric was visually intriguing and also set up the story very well. The above water sequences were much better than those that took place underwater. The underwater scenes were sometimes strange to look at. The CGI was sometimes obvious and a bit off putting especially in scenes where the water was bright. There seemed to be a disconnect between the back and foreground.

Halle Bailey did a great job playing the role of Ariel. She was able to capture Ariel's innocence and emote those feelings on screen. She was able to use her expressions very well in the scenes where she was not allowed to speak. She also sang very well giving each song the emotion it needed. However, the song that she sang as an inner thought did not work well. She was singing but on screen she was just walking around and when it began it was a bit confusing. Perhaps they could have made her act out what she was singing even if she wasn't moving her lips.

Jonah Hauer-King who plays Eric (the prince) was an okay character. The film talks a bit about his desires but they are very surface level. These desires are merely mentioned to show the audience that his struggles are similar to Ariels. The one song he sang was fine but the transition from him singing on land to singing on the ship was weird. There wasn't an explanation as to why he was on the ship aside from making the performance seem more dramatic. Overall, his character was bland and not very Prince Charming. The romance he shares with Ariel is not really fleshed out. He and Ariel only knew each other for a few days and so it all felt very rushed and not very believable.

Melissa McCarthy as Ursula was great. She was very menacing and a lot of detail was put into her look. The song she sings is great and she did a good job performing it and making it feel part of the story. But her motives were a bit shallow like many of the other characters. All of the characters suffer from the same lack of development.

King Triton played by Javier Bardem was very limited in this role. He still managed to do a good enough job considering he was only in the story to tell Ariel what not to do and eventually have a change of heart. More could have been done with this character to showcase his powers, it could have served as a great battle between himself and Ursula.

David Diggs as Sebastian was very funny. The songs he sang were fine although I would say that they did not sound as great as the original singer. The animated film did provide more energy to his performances.

Scuttle who was played by Awkwafina worked for me in this role. She wasn't involved too much but just enough to be funny. I didn't mind the rap song she performed although some might be turned off by it.

Flounder who was played by Jacob Tremblay was one of the more underwhelming characters. He only had a few lines and was quite forgettable. Just like the mermaid sisters who served absolutely no purpose. The other role characters were played well but didn't do anything to add to the story.

Overall, this film was entertaining and a good enough film for families to watch. There could have been better character development which would off made the story much stronger. The CGI could have also been improved upon. The songs were not overwhelming but at the same time they were not very catchy. This film does lack heart, it was not an emotional film. By the end there wasn't any connection to any of the characters so the ending was not satisfying."
"What happened?CGI awful. The story should have at least been nostalgic but somehow became boring.

WTH with the songs? Outside of the original songs, the new songs were lame. I felt like I was watching some toddler show intended to capture the attention the littles who need overly dramatic songs

I thought maybe it was just me and or adults but nope. You could hear some kids in theatre ask questions as to WTH was happening and who was what.

Loved the live action adaptation of Beauty and the beast, Cinderella, Aladdin, the lion King, Mulan etc. But this...

Then you have the obvious deviation from all other live action remakes to this version. Do t pay to see it. Wait to watch or rent it. Not worth the ticket price."
"Absolutely amazingThis movie was so good. No one could ever play Ariel the way Halle did. Didn't think it was possible to love her even more than I already did but this movie proved me wrong.

Jonah was also such a great cast for prince Eric. The chemistry between these two was so good and I hope that they do more movies together and maybe even a The Little Mermaid 2 because this movie deserves a sequel just for the cast.

Melissa surprised me because I wasn't expecting to like her as Ursula as much as I did.

The only reason this movie is not rated as 10/10 is simply because of Awkwafina's voice irritated me every time she spoke specially during Kiss The Girl. Her addition was widely annoying."
"Keep missing on live action remakes.Beauty and The Beast - One of the best live action adaptation Disney has done. Don't get too excited as that wasn't even that great. Dumbo was excellent. Not much was changed in the film. It was enjoyable.

Now onto The Little Mermaid. Arguably my favorite Disney movie - the original. Why change the songs? If you're going to remake a classic Disney movie, do it well or don't do it at all. I think Disney has a lot of work to do to earn the fandom if they are going to continue.

I am an overall fan of film in general. It takes a lot for me to give poor reviews. It takes even more for me to walk out of or stop watching a film. I did finish The Little Mermaid. However, I was very underwhelmed."
"Halle is so beautiful and her performance brought me to tearsHalle had the most beautiful voice of any Disney princess live or cartoon, and it was so captivating every time she sang. Im so happy they chose a young actress for this role because I felt like she truly embodied the naive and curiosity that the cartoon Ariel had. The CGI was...interesting. Idk about the look of Sebatian and Flounder, I personally would have preferred the more cartoon look.

Overall i think it was one of the best live action renditions of a classic. The iconic 'Under the Sea' song and dance didn't disappoint and the cast reminded me of Rodgers & Hammerstein's Cinderella. Like that movie this is a classic i can see myself watching time and time again."
"An ok Disney MovieIs a good movie to watch with kids, even if they fall sleep because it comes tedious and boring, but to watch once is enough, is not a bad movie, but of cousre it has it flaws and a lot of them, if u compare with the animated film obviously this one is Atroscious, but for today stupid standadrs is an ok movie, seriously is a just one watch movie, nothing else, the songs are ok, not great, the acting is hilarious and in many ways TeRRIBLE, but is a kids movie, kids from 3 to 6 will never see the bad acting, older kids of course will start laughing at the poor acting and will be going to buy candies or pop corn while sing in the movie, but overall is a 5 stars movie."
"Enjoyable and Re-WatchableI love the classics and I very much dislike most of the remakes that Disney has been dishing out. In my perspective, there have only been 3 live action Disney films I have enjoyed just as much as the originals: 2015 Cinderella, Beauty and the Beast, and now the Little Mermaid. The songs were well done, they added a couple new songs as well, and they were fun to hear. The acting was very good. The only thing that seemed a little off was Sebastian's voice. I enjoyed the low voice of the original, which also made the old songs very memorable. But it's a small thing compared to the rest of the movie. There were no forced agendas in the movie either, which is something I have hated completely in most of these remakes. Definitely something I will rewatch again."

"This remake should of been done to make the original movie better not worse.The storyline is just peedictable and can be very much boring, the characters changes made were worse and the movie writers should have focused on improving the story and making it more alive alike. And the water CGI is terrible. Most of the time the sea water sea is invisible. The little mermaid seems floating most of the time instead of swimming and the tails movement is just not natural like fish. The CGI team should have taken lessons from divers and not make everything by CGI which is not giving the results I was hoping for and I'm sure that the audience not matter the age will notice that the sea is just non existent due to the bad CGi and editing and even children will notice that something is not right with the whole sea CGi. I hope that the Disney team makes another Little mermaid with better CGI and storyline."
"Incredible retelling of a beautiful love storyFirst, Halle is incredible. Her singing was on point and her acting, even though you could tell this was her first role, was so well done. She brought her full self into the role. My favorite actor was Melissa McCarthy. She. Was. Balling! Her portrayal of Ursula was magical. And who knew Melissa could sing so well? My daughter has been belting out 'Poor unfortunate souls' a lot more than 'Part of your world'. And you can tell Melissa was in her bag. It is an incredible story, the music is near perfect - they even wrote a whole ass song for Eric and gave, this otherwise two dimensional guy, a whole new depth. Do yourself a favor, don't listen to the hate. Watch the darn movie, it's worth it."
Nice voice with nothing spacial muchThe main characters are able to hold the story with wonderful voice but the picture and story cannot convey any spectacular message that they try to say. They seem try to stick with the original animation except the main character however there were some confusion on the story and something new which make the film too bluntly to impress and impact any feelings. The actors voices were the strongest thing in this story however the acting was too shallow and give some confusion. Some scenes were too boring for me as the story can be predicted and the actors were not able to create something that they would like to besides the looks which were not nice moves for original movie.
Excellent Movie! Must See!The singing was superb and moving. The cinematography was stunning & engaging. The storyline was refreshing with a positive message of not judging others. The audience was clapping throughout the movie. My daughter & I were very moved when Hallie sang and created core memories. I highly recommend you go see this positive & uplifting movie. You will enjoy it!. All of the actors did an amazing job. I like the diversity of the cast and the beautiful representation on the screen. The movie displayed challenging yet loving parent child relationships. The actors made working under water seem effortless. Fantastic job!

"Don't believe these reviews...The Little Mermaid is thoroughly enjoyable summer movie. It may be a bit too long for younger children but it kept us engaged to the very end. All of these reviews saying the CGI is bad are flat out lying. Everything done with computer effects is absolutely top notch and stunning; the storm on the ocean at the beginning was spectacular. The one star reviews you have been seeing are from people with no sense of wonder or imagination. Or from trolls who never saw the movie at all. Hallie is a wonderful young actress whose face just lights up the screen. Do yourself a favor and see this movie, if it doesn't make you feel good, then there is something wrong."

"Too long too dullLoved the lion king and jungle remakes but this is just too long. Why???? Nothing happens for long periods of time and when it does it's very underwhelming. Watched Mario recently , that is a far superior movie. It's fun , has structure , is faithful to the source material and is genuinely endearing.

This film on the other hand adds needless amounts of incessant backstory , drags out narrative and has some serious questionable special effects.

One redeeming point is that the score is pretty good With good themes and cues . It has a rousing ambience that is reminiscent of old Disney at its best. This however, overall is not Disney at its best."
"One Of The Best Live-Action AdaptationsI really enjoyed The Little Mermaid! Halle Bailey is absolutely perfect for Ariel in every single way. I liked how they expanded Prince Eric's character and Sebastian was hilarious! Melissa McCarthy was great as Ursula. The new songs weren't that great and Javier Bardem fell flat as King Triton for me. Wish they would've played with the storyline a liiiittle bit more, as some of the scene re-enactments with identical dialogue became a little tiresome. It shined when they expanded the source material with the original Hans Christian Andersen tie-ins. Some of the best moments were due to Ariel and Eric's chemistry, and I felt the ending was a bit rushed and they could've tweaked the final act to really build more drama between Ursula, Ariel, Eric and King Triton. Overall I really enjoyed it, but Cinderella still has it beat in my book as the best Disney live action adaptation."

"WowwwwThis. Movie. Was. Amazing!! I can't believe it. Best live action yet. Halle's voice !! Angelic. Can't wait to see it again because the cast did a fantastic job with this one. Everything a Disney movie should be and more ! The soundtrack is so so so amazing and it gives you all the feels good from the animated movie and more. I can't believe they pulled this off. The trailers did it no justice. So much better on the big screen. If you didn't like this movie. I don't know what to tell you. Because anything , this is a great movie and a twist on a beloved Disney classic. 10/10 highly recommended this movie."
Nostalgia bombI had high hopes for this movie and maybe that is why I am so hard on it but tbh they screwed this just like the love action Aladdin. I just am losing faith in disneys ability to make love action movies. Maybe they should start finding new ideas. Stop messing with the good classics and give us new princesses. I'd love to see some diversity and some amazing new ones but damn guys that blows. The new songs were just out of the blue just like the ones in Aladdin. They skimmed the nostalgia parts so bad and made it feel rushed and then the new songs and such they drug out so much I was contemplating walking out. I probably will never watch this again.
"The best Disney live action movie to dateHalle Bailey shines as Ariel in this updated Disney Classic. Out of all of Disney's cash grab remakes, the little mermaid sails 😉 above the rest.

I had my doubts about Melissa McCarthy as Ursula but she did a great job at bringing the titular character to life.

The way they revamped Under the Sea was a little off putting to me but I realized with the live action, it would have been ridiculous to see all the sea creatures playing instruments 😂😂 we can only suspend our disbelief so far.

The chemistry between Halle and her male costar was amazing and didn't feel forced. I would highly recommend this movie and will most likely be seeing it a second time!!"
"Not the best adaptation. Doesn't work, or have the same charm.The realistic CGI look works sometimes but here it doesn't particularly do what it's trying to do. Flounder is cute and all but I cannot get past the look of him. If they kept even the semi realistic style, so him having his chubbier cheeks but still looking like a real fish, would have worked so much better. I think there's still a fine line between completely live action vs. Animated. The new original songs also are not great at all. Didn't gel with them. Not catchy. King Tridon was actually alright as were the sisters. Overall, completely unnecessary. I also did not enjoy Halle's singing style, although she can actually sing at least."
"Disney has apparently quit making good moviesI took my friend's daughters to see this. They were so bored, they wanted to leave after 45 minutes. I think the animation was just HORRIBLE! It's 2023 but it felt like 1993 watching this movie. The actress who played Ariel is a good singer but her acting... not so much. Melissa McCarthy was even not that great. The lines they gave her fell flat and she didn't get to shine as an actress like she usually does. I was hoping as much as they hyped this and it's big budget it would be amazing to see on the big screen. Sadly, I was wrong. I'm not even sure I would watch this on Disney+. My advice? SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!"
"First live action remake I found absolutely WORTH IT!Stunning visuals, from the mesmerizing deep sea light and colors, to the island vibrancy, this movie felt like a beautiful vacation. Each song and character was enhanced in this version. Melissa and ""Vanessa"" kill as Úrsula, honoring the iconic villain. Eric is finally a human being rather than a prop, and we get to know him and root for him. Bardem is the perfect King, Awkafina is hilarious, Daveed nails it, and flounder is the perfect cute side-kick. This version delivers an improved romantic storyline to the family dynamics. I laughed, I cried, I singed, I begged Eric to kiss the girl. I fell for this movie."
Scuttlebutt song is HORRIBLEThe scutebutt song ruined the film for me. I love awkwafina but her singing in this one just wasn't it. Shouldn't have even added her voice to the kiss the girl part. Eric and king triton were very lackluster and boring- Halley did a good job in the first half but I don't care for how she portrays Ariel after she turns human. Ursula was the best part of the movie and I wish we would've gotten more of her. I would watch again but definitely will fast forward thru the scuttlebutt song. There needed to be more depth to the characters and their development- out of all the remakes this one fell really short after all the time they put into it.

"""We've Got to Have... Money!""The Little Mermaid is yet ANOTHER exercise in Disney's remake-era creative bankruptcy: and another reason why these 'adaptations' don't do the originals justice (besides The Jungle Book and Cinderella remakes). Sure these remakes boast technological prowess with their CGI imitations of the film's sidekicks and set-pieces with the limitations of live-action green screens compared to the traditional animation done before, but these films cannot hide the basic facts: that these remakes are nothing but redundant excuses for making... money.

The Little Mermaid is a big-budget school play filmed with fancy Arri Alexas and given the Hollywood polish of modern Disney remakes with the creative charisma of a TikTok user preaching about the works of Stephanie Meyer and the Twilight films as misunderstood masterpieces that only needed 'content updates' to be considered perfect for today's media landscape.

The Little Mermaid is a hollow imitation of a classic film that was WAY more alive than this live-action cash-in could ever dream to be. Sure some of the film's elements are okay (the original songs remain relatively unaffected) and the effects are nice (when they're not literally TOO dark to even see, underwater too), but the film's really at the mercy of being a remake, especially when the new songs are terrible additions to the overall experience. The film's energy is almost intentionally stilted compared to the original. It's very bizarre and jarring.

Basically: this is a cash-cow film that's gonna be forgotten about in a matter of weeks compared to 2023's other tentpole releases.

Disney... you were better than this. What gives now? These films should be lifelong passion projects, not pricey products imitating better movies when most people will ultimately remember the original over this one anyway.

Controversies aside: can we stop pretending this creative laziness is okay for 21st Century Cinema? Especially Disney of all studios? Because we all know for sure it's not alright."

"Wondering why it has so higher rate than AladdinI went to the movies yesterday to give it a shot, but I should have simply stayed at home. Terrible CGI, no life-changing storyline as in Aladdin live action, and unneeded additional songs and unfunny jokes, How could this garbage be ranked higher than Aladdin 2019?!

The CGI was quite good when for scenes when they were on land (which is about a quarter of the movie), but the underwater scenes were deadass awful. I thought maybe at least the underwater CGI could please my eyes like Avatar did. Anyhow, Prince Eric's cast is the cute.

Just don't bother wasting your money to watch this at the cinema."
Another remake worth waiting for on streamingI took our kids to see it. One did enjoy it and the other sleep through half the movie. The actors and actresses can def sing. The acting was okay. Lin Manuel added songs did not mix well with Howard's original songs. It just felt jumbled. Some story changes which make sense and kinda filling plot holes and certain characters developments that were in the original. But then there were added back story and some things that didn't make sense and felt it was wasted. At least the sea creatures had more expressions than the lion king remake (only by a little). It's why I gave it a 5. Some things worked and some things didn't. Some things looked great like under the sea song. And some things you wish it wasn't bland. I think it's worth the streaming watch when it's on Disney+. But theater watching not so much.
"The best disney live action!!I have been excited for this movie ever since they announced the casting years ago, and this movie exceeded all of my expectations. It was fun, adventurous, light-hearted, everything and more! Halle Bailey was the most amazing Ariel, her voice and her acting was absolutely splendid and I know no one else could have topped her (sorry not sorry!) And don't get me started on Jonah Hauer-King! Good at acting and can sing? Hello, this movie was perfect, I don't care. My one and only complaint is the fact that Awkafina was Scuttle. If you know, you know. Melissa was an amazing Urusula, did not know she could sing! The casting was impeccable! Well, they could have done a better Caribbean accent for Sebastian like cmon y'all. Anyways, amazing movie 10/10. Best disney live action!! I would say more but don't want to anger the haters."
"Terrible re make.There is a magic that lends itself to the classic animated Disney cartoons, that just does not translate well into live action. The leads in Cinderella and Beauty and the Beast gave it a good go, but neither film was very good. There have been a host of Snow White versions, again none really hit the mark. Perhaps the best live action version of these characters belongs to the Once Upon A Time tv show. This put the classic characters out of their traditional story lines, and placed them into a contemporary setting. But as for Little Mermaid , Poppy Drayton accounted well for herself in the 2018 live action film, although the film itself was disappointing . As for this latest 2023 version, its up there with the Star Wars sequels. Just watch the original 1989 film and forget this re make."
"Absolutely AmazingI just got back from watching The Little Mermaid in 3D. And it was truly amazing and magical. Halle Bailey performance was just out of this world. You were able to immediately connect with her version of Ariel. Her emotions through her eyes and facial expressions was truly beautiful. She captured Ariel's essence, her innocence and determination, as well as her rebellious nature, amazingly. Halle is truly Ariel. Jonah's Eric was so much better than the animated version, to me personally. He had more depth to his character and, unlike the original version, I was more able to connect to him and care for him and his wellbeing throughout the movie. Daveed's Sebastian was so funny, and him and Awkwafina's Scuttle's banter and comedic relief was literally everything. . Melissa's Ursula? Now let me tell you... was scary yet funny at the same time. She was able to capture Ursula's essence amazingly. And it was so convincing. When I watched her, I didn't see Melissa, I only saw Ursula. The movie was truly amazing, and it was definitely a movie that will be watched over and over again. And can definitely be it's on classic for this new generation and maybe generations to come. A 10/10 movie and experience."
"Just okGrand kids were bored after the first 15 minutes, so we went to the park after trying to sit through it. They picked up on the lyrics change quite quickly. The actress playing Aeriel musically fit and her acting was ok but there are just some shows that don't translate well from animation to live. Especially when some of the biggest characters are from the animal kingdom. Ursula was by far the biggest disappointment from animation to live. When you take a loved children's cartoon and remake it strictly to make money it loses the flavor. I really wanted to like this movie but it just wasn't cute. Sorry Disney... big fail."
"Best Live Action Disney!I was lucky enough to see this movie on Wednesday, 5/24 before a lot of people. The Little Mermaid live action far exceeded every single expectation that I had. The actors were perfectly cast and beyond phenomenal. Halle brought Ariel to life in ways that I could have never imagined. She has the most angelic voice that brought me to tears. Melissa McCarthy was the best Ursula and sounded exactly like her. I loved the new spins that they added to the film while still staying true to the classic. It is absolutely the best live action Disney movie thus far. I plan to see it again in theaters again soon."
"Almost, but not quite there.Clichéd Plot: I had hoped that the live-action version would make changes to the previous storyline, but the movie still follows the old cartoon plot. The female lead's ""love-struck brain"" and the ""love at first sight, running away from home"" scenario are outdated. Since the story's background has been adapted, the love views of the princess and the prince should also change according to the times.

Stiff Acting from the Lead: In this type of live-action remake, most of the storylines are well-known, but the focus lies on the actors' performances. However, the female lead of The Little Mermaid might be stiff in her acting due to her first film experience. Her line delivery is extremely rigid, and her facial expressions during singing also ""need improvement."" Particularly, during the scene where the mermaid watches the prince being saved from behind a reef, her expression should convey ""falling for the male lead and yearning for a life on land."" However, the actress's gaze at that moment comes off as ""overdone,"" giving an unintended ""hint of resentment.""

Rough Set Design: In terms of set design, there is a significant difference between the land and underwater worlds. The underwater world has spectacular effects, while the land kingdom looks very ""simple"" and ""unimpressive"" in comparison. The palace lacks the grandeur and elegance it should have, and the island kingdom appears ""narrow,"" failing to convey a royal atmosphere. The film leaves the impression of ""almost, but not quite there.""

Illogical Costumes: The female lead is ""quite cute"" and her singing is emotionally engaging. However, her styling is a letdown. It seems like the production team did not put much effort into her makeup, costume, and camera angles. Her dress in the movie lacks elegance and does not complement the character. Her hairstyle also looks messy, especially after she reaches the shore, giving a ""wild and unkempt"" impression.

The styling of the land kingdom is also problematic. In a tropical island nation, it is strange and contradictory to have European-style palace architecture and court attire.

Limited Undersea Character Development: The underwater kingdom's storyline mainly revolves around the female lead, her father, the crab, and the sea witch. The depiction of other mermaids and characters is minimal, even the female lead's sisters have very little screen time, appearing only about three times throughout the movie. Yet, suddenly, many mermaids appear in the ending, making the scene feel abrupt.

Low Immersion: The overall immersion of the movie is quite low, especially regarding the female lead and her sisters. They are portrayed as ""seven princesses of different nationalities and skin colors,"" making them look ""nothing like a family."" This is also highly illogical, as the sisters have no resemblance whatsoever, which suggests that the sea king is ""quite promiscuous."""
"Not entirely terrible but still badThey had huge shoes to fill in remaking a timeless classic, and it fell (almost) completely flat. The saving grace of this movie was Melissa McCarthy as Ursula - absolutely phenomenal in the way she tackled the role.

Halle Bailey is average at best. Sure, she's adorable and conveys a fair sense of childlike wonder, which is the hallmark of the Ariel character, so she at least hit the nail on the head there. But for such a large role, it seemed the casting was a below average choice (controversy aside).

Also... I love Awkwafina, but I feel like her schtick was unnecessary.

I'd avoid this film."
"A visual delight!Halle Bailey's performances as Ariel is truly amazing, she takes you on an emotional ride and further flushes out the character bringing a new level of human complexity. Melissa McCartney as Ursula is simply fun to watch.

If you have the ability to watch this movie on an iMac screen, I highly suggest that you do, the audio and visuals immersed you into the world of the little mermaid.

The new music is overall decent. Erics song is sadly pretty forgettable. As much as people are hating the scuttlebutt it's a pretty fun song that stand outs from the new songs. The Part of your world reprise is rather poignant thanks to Halle Baileys emotional performance.

Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, and would recommend it to new and old little mermaid fans alike."
"Not a good movieMy mom took me to the original in 1989 and I recall seeing a great flick. Fast forward to this year and take my family to the cinema and am hoping for similar quality. It did not happen to say the least.

I can go on and on to state what wss missing.

The plot was predictible, lacking imagination and plain wierd.

Even the musical scores seemed out of place. You would think after 35 years and having a hit brand that the film makers would do a stand up job and have the highest quality production staff. They scimped on music.

The acting was sort of cute. I have admit that it seemed like the lead actor was trying his best but seemed to be over trying. A big thumbs down."
"Beautiful and Entertaining !Not really into musical movies, but I really enjoyed each character musical solos ! Halle Bailey is very refreshing. The films cinematography was awesome !

Everyone is entitled to their opinions, I saw the movie twice ! Each time the movie ended with an applause from fellow movie goers! But, like I have emphasized everyone has their own opinions and reasons?????

You really can't compare an animated film to a live film!

I can honestly say if you're into fantasies you'll love the movie .

If you want to be your on person and not be persuaded by others for the wrong reasons. Be you, and make your own decisions . Have a great time!"
"CGI and music a dud, Ursula and Scuttle done well, Sea Ariel bad, Land Ariel goodI saw it opening day and it was just bad. Closeup underwater scenes had no detectable water and the CGI movements were unnatural. The worst thing was the music, or lack of it. All the songs were basically A Capella with the music dim and dulled as though from an adjacent building. Flounder and Sebastian were realistic CGI but to the point of being emotionless non-characters. Ursula and Scuttle were done much better. Ariel's acting was best during the non-dialog parts later in the film. But the early parts interacting with her family the dialog was emotionless and you never felt a bond between Ariel and any of the other characters until after she was rendered mute. But once she had no dialog, her acting came across very well and established that audience bond much better."
"Magical and EnchantingI thought they did an excellent job capturing the joy of the first movie while creating an interesting live action. I loved all the characters and graphics. I am surprised people are hating so hard on this. I saw it in 3D and it was mesmerizing. I am very happy with this movie and look forward to seeing it again with my friends.

At first seeing the side CGI characters I wasn't sure but they grew on me. I thought it was colorful undersea but did a good job capturing the darkness. Prince Eric was probably my least fave character but he still did good capturing Prince Eric's boyish charm. The actress who played Ariel nailed it."
"Live action failsThere was a magic to Disney when I was younger. The films like Aladdin, Lion King even Hercules were fun, tongue in cheek and the music was entertaining. The little mermaid was good, I took a girlfriend to see it, she loved it and cried. So when this came round I thought I would take my niece, as she loves Disney. She was really excited at the start but by half way she was bored as was I. This was not the film I remembered. My main complaint was the fact it was overly long, a 140 mins when the original was about 90 mins. There was just too much added to the film. The acting also was lame. The main actress was ok, she had a nice singing voice, but I felt I couldn't invest in any of the characters. The CGI characters were disappointing. This film is fantasy, it's not meant to be real, and yet to make a photo real lobster with no character expression was a let down.

I give this film a 3/10 Because it didn't do enough to entertain those who enjoyed the original and because it didn't do enough to entertain my niece."
"No color in a Disney movieI'm gonna only talk about colors which aren't any in this live action remake.

So maybe if you want to watch it please don't bring your kids with you,I bring my kids and they fell asleep in the 1st half because IT WAS TOO DARK!

It's astonishing that universal is winning the race in the kids genre, look at Mario brothers, look at the Despicable franchise and The one where they're making fun of the panic attack.

If by any chance DreamWorks want to make any live action of these movies which I don't recommend them to, it's gonna be too late for Disney to touch them.

Look at Sony's Spiderverse movies. Disney should learn from her mistakes."
"The little mermaid 2023 brought back very nice childhood memories, it gave me a lot of nostalgia, I loved Halle Bailey as Ariel, the other characters are fine except Flounder,The little mermaid 2023 brought back very nice childhood memories, it gave me a lot of nostalgia, I loved Halle Bailey as Ariel, the other characters are fine except Flounder, I was not completely convinced, Ariel's sisters are horrible.

Jassica Alexander as Vanessa is magnificent, giving us some of the best performances in the film.

Sebastian, flaunder and Scuttle's design They are horrible, but Sebastian and Scuttle are convincing.

The story is the same, ariel has no sudden changes Halley has a beautiful voice.

The CGI falters at times but they are decent.

The ending is a bit weak.

But it's still a very good movie, worth it It's not perfect but it's fine being a live action."
"This movie lacked magic and fun.I wasn't sure what to expect from this film as I hold the animated movie in high regard. The first half of the movie felt slow and a little boring. The vibrant colours and magical fun from the animated film was missing in this live action. I'm not sure if it was because they tried to make it more realistic, but there is no sense of wonder or magic about the world under the sea. Most children around me in the cinema got bored and were playing under the seats. Some of my favourite fun or glamorous moments from the 1989 movie don't make the cut.

I was dissatisfied with the lack of mermaids and magical set design throughout most of this film. The second half of the movie improved but by the end I was left disappointed.

I thought the cast did well and embodied each of their characters, especially Ariel! She sung perfectly and was the perfect Disney princess. I just wish she had more vibrant colours to stand out under water. My only criticism was with King Trident, as I felt a lack of chemistry with his character and others on screen.

Overall this movie was a good musical interpretation of ""The Little Mermaid"" but as a children's movie it falls flat. Failing to capture their attention with magic or vibrant colours."
"Pretty good remakeMy adult granddaughter and I went to see the Little Mermaid.

We both enjoyed it.

Halle Bailey is beautiful and has a beautiful voice. I think she was perfectly cast and is a great Ariel.

For those who don't like remakes, you may not like it. My granddaughter said the animated is still her favorite; but she truly liked this one.

I personally loved the underwater scenes; the cinematography is great. The love story of Ariel and Eric is believable; they have chemistry.

It is a remake of the animated version but with a lot of action scenes.

Probably my least favorite part was Melissa McCarthy as Ursula. I love Melissa in most movies; but I just didn't enjoy her in this role.

Overall, it was a fun, enjoyable movie to watch."
"Amazing Halle and mediocre movieAs amazing as Halle is in her role, the rest of the film is just as bad.

The whole film is a perfect example of the fact that the creators of remakes not only do not understand the original, but are guided by some strange ideas about it. And it would be possible to ignore the extremely mediocre script, lazy decisions and other dubious moments if the film itself gave pleasure to the way it looks. Unfortunately, the palette of the film is more like a movie about the war than a colorful adventure of the little mermaid. The only reason to watch this movie is Halle. She is a titan. Her voice is amazing, the acting is great. She deserves a starring role in a really good movie, not another mediocre Disney remake."
"Spectacular.Right from the start I was captivated. It was heartwarming, funny and absolutely beautiful. I was very hesitant to see this movie because I loved the original, but this live version stands all on its own which is really hard to do with a remake, but well done 👏🏽 They nailed it with the characters, the story and the under water world. The visual effects are unbelievable! I was pleasantly surprised. I will be purchasing this movie when it releases.

You definitely should see this film while it's in theatres and in 3D! Disney did well with this one. I almost never like the live remakes. Well done!"
"This is badIt feels simultaneously rushed and slowed down, every song cue is mistimed where it feels awkward, the songs feel less emotionally sincere and lyrics are mismatched with the visuals, almost every bit of visual spectacle from the animated version is omitted.

The Lyn Manuel Miranda songs are obnoxious, kitschy tunes, The scuttlebutt is a terrible song.

The big problem is that the film is only competent enough to be subpar, so it isn't hilariously terrible in a fun way. It's frustrating to watch.

This movie is 1 hour longer than the original and you feel it hard. Everything is so and everything drags on forever."

"GorgeousAs soon as she started singing ""look at this stuff isn't it neat"" I started crying. The songs are so beautifully done. The whole plot is there, same as the original. Minor changes and additions. Halle Baileys portrayal and performance as Ariel was 10/10. Kids may not find it very fun. One thing that live action remakes always lose is the humor. Not a particularly funny film but still beautiful to watch. Only complaint is same complaint I have for other remakes and that is sometimes it feels like the live actors are just saying the lines instead of acting the lines. King Tritons anger in the original was fierce and scary. The remake is Javier Bardem whispering. Still good and enjoyable just feels like it missed the take in some scenes.

8/10 film will watch again."

"Not worth the timeHalle Bailey and Melissa McCarthy ( her screen time was not very long) were the only acting bright spots in this film. I was very disappointed. I was expecting more funny one liners. Way to many dead spots, scenes did not flow together well. This 2 hour movie seemed to be a lot longer. Completely skipped some of my favorite scenes from the original version. I think that some scenes will be to scary and intense for younger viewers. Stick with the animated version for those little ones. Overall it just fell flat on so many different fronts. I would save my money and see it when it starts streaming for free."
"I loved it!Something I dislike about most of the disney remakes is the weird unnecessary added parts or songs, instead of the songs and moments from the animated movies we grew up loving. And this movie is where they got that RIGHT. Its like a carbon copy of the animated film but with real people with amazing singing voices. Amazing what can be achieved when they pick people that can actually sing instead of Emma Watson.

Something else that I think is hard to achieve in these live actions (or indeed any films) is the chemistry between the two main characters. I absolutely loved Halle Bailey and jonah hauer-king together, they made their romance seem so believable.

Melissa McCarthy did a good job as Ursula but not gonna lie, I would have liked someone with an incredible soulful voice to have played her part. Thats my only criticism.

I really enjoyed this movie and so did my niece. Will definitely be watching again!"
"Halle Bailey is the only good thing about the movieThe underwater scenes are really bad (cringe). Halle Bailey is the only good thing about the movie, but only in the ""land scenes"" it seems like any of the actors don't know or care to act with green screen. The sidekicks are really plain characters. Melissa McCarthy tried to imitate a drag queen.

The new songs are Encanto 2.0, the only adition or change to the plot I loved was the ""explanation"" of why Ariel fell in love or got interested in Eric. That was a really nice touch. And... Why Vanessa was white? The idea of ursula becoming Vanessa to trick Eric was to imitate Ariel, therefore she should have look like Ariel."
"Dull and anticlimacticHalle Berry and Mellissa McCarthy made this movie bearable. Halle was stunning as Ariel and Melissa was an amazing Ursula. Only reasons this movie got 3 stars.

Triton had no emotion where was his booming voice he was so monotone. The songs were personalally not my favorite. I felt no emotion in the movie they left out two best parts. Eric finding Ariel on the beach, instead it was a boring ""first"" meet. Love how the added parts have Ariel and Eric a meaningful relationship. Ariel's stunning moment walking out of the water with her sparkly dress was cut instead she just appeared next to Eric. There was no excitement or emotional parts.

Beautifully created, but storyline dull."
"MagicalI just loved this movie. Halle is the perfect Ariel and I'm not sure they could have cast a better Eric either. Jonah is amazing - he looks the part and brings so much more personality to the role than you get in the cartoon. The chemistry between these two was perfection. I really enjoyed the scenes where they spent time together and Eric showing Ariel all of his favourite things. It brings the love story to life in a way the original doesn't.

I also loved Melissa as Ursula. She was funny and looked the part for sure.

I do wish Flounder was a little cuter, but once I was into the movie it didn't bother me at all.

Such fun and just a sweet magical movie."
"One star because 0 wasn't an option.I guess if I'd never seen the fantastic original cartoon I might have been a bit more forgiving on this pile of hot garbage. If you compare this flick to it's 2023 counterparts it's a little below average. If you compare it to the original or the overall offerings of Hollywood over the years it's a bottom dwelling, dumpster fire.

Halle whatshername was about the only likable, and relatable character, but I still couldn't escape the feeling it was just an uninspired, lazy attempt to reuse old material. Frankly since the really good original is still available, there really was no need for this piece of schlock to exist."
"I was not disappointed!! Love it!The cast couldn't have been chosen better, they were talented and truly brought their characters to life with so much charm. The Little Mermaid has the perfect balance of romance , comedy and the thrill. The diversity was beautiful to see and I loved how side characters and settings were more developed in this movie than the original, eg. Scuttle, Sébastien and Eric's kingdom having a rich culture made things 1000 times more interesting. I can't wait to watch it again, I wish everyone would watch it with an open mind because Halle is the best Ariel there is,her voice alone can attest to that❤🙏"
"How disappointing...Disney plumbs a new all-time low. As an adult, I was disappointed in the quality of this film. It's hard to believe that a big, established, Hollywood production house was behind it. It felt more like a low budget independent film project to me. The kids with me (3) were a mixed bag.... 1 girl liked it, and the other 2 (a boy and a girl), didn't care for it. One comment was that it seemed ""fake"".

You would think that a company the size of Disney, with the LONG history of catering to childrens imaginations, would be able to put together a more appealing offering for its fan base. Sadly the film felt as if it was hastily thrown together... probably to try and make some point by artists(?) that have lost focus on what creativity is. SAD."

"Halle Bailey was greatToo bad good acting and great voice will be wasted on a boring movie with a mediocre visual effects and ok soundtrack ( could have done without Miranda's new songs) which is surprising from Disney considering the original music is usually future classic. Halle Baile's voice was breathtaking , powerfully yet sweet and innocent . Still, not sure why make a remake if not at least trying to be better than the original, so yeah watch the original and save your money and time. The original had more coherent script and great soundtrack still not sure how to differentiate this one except the live part which was more dead than the cartoon. They would have been better off with new script all together instead of trying this odd sequel that simply does not work."
"ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFULI loved ""The Little Mermaid"" so much! Halle Bailey gives an amazing performance as the mermaid-princess, Ariel. The colors above and below the sea are very vibrant and colorful. I loved the parts of Ariel dancing with all of the ocean animals. I also enjoyed the Prince Eric storyline and how Ariel and Eric both share the interest of exploring worlds a part from their own. I laughed, cried, and smiled throughout the entire movie. ""The Little Mermaid"" is my favorite live action movie that Disney has created. Max is also adorable in the movie and I love the friendship Max and Ariel form with each other."
Slap in the faceWhat a slap in the face this was to the original. Plus the CGI my god SYFY channel had better graphics. The changing of songs and the story line. Maybe Disney should go back and redo the animated one to. Match it with garbage of a movie. I will always prefer the original over this fire dumpster of a movie. The original was just perfect of a movie. Having to watch a two hour long movie to fill in the gaps that doesn't help the movie at all. Was a nightmare. At least the original you new and could follow the plot line of the movie. They changed it so much and it's sad. Disney just won't learn their lesson with their movies. People want to see the originals come to life not these garbage remakes that ruin it so much.
"A sweet and thoughtful remake of TLM 1989As a little 6 year old girl in 1989, I still remember seeing The Little Mermaid in theaters and waiting for what felt like forever to get the videocassette. In my desperation to get more Little Mermaid, I then read the story by Hans Christian Andersen. My littler self was heartbroken to read that in his telling, she felt as if she was walking on knives and ultimately she died. Fast forward to watching this with two little girls of my own, I was glad for the Disney version of the story and it's Happily Ever After. The elegant visuals and heartfelt performances moved me to tears during Halle Bailey's ""Part of your World."" She truly does have the voice of a siren, and I appreciated the new script updating little details that referred to the earlier precursor myths of mermaids. The wonderful thing about storytelling is that each storyteller gets to add their own touches. The Little Mermaid does a mesmerizing job of connecting tales of sirens past to stories mermaids today."
"Yet another unimaginative remakeWhile major critics are hyping it up as the most innovative thing this year, i say otherwise.

Idea goes against the original story, and feels like the movie was remade not only as a quick cash grab, but also to market to specific groups to try and mitigate any history from Disney. The live action seems more like 90% CGI and 10% live action. Would have been better to simply go pure CGI.

Would not recommend and wished i spent the money on a different movie that would have been more enjoyable. Original will remain better than this sad excuse for a remake that's simply a cash grab and nothing more."
"A sweet and extended retelling with a terrific cast, especially Bailey.I actually didn't see the original Little Mermaid till I was 16 and watched it in my 11th grade Music class. That was also the class I was introduced to Hairspray, another movie I probably wasn't looking for in my life but ended up falling in love with. In the 1989 Mermaid, I found the songs fun, I found the story simple and sweet, what wasn't to like? When it comes to the Disney live-action adaptations, so far I've had a generally mixed response. I haven't yet seen Beauty and the Beast, I liked Aladdin a fair bit, I felt Mulan was missing a bit, and I felt The Lion King took way too few chances. But with how Disney was trying out clearly new ideas with the new Little Mermaid and hearing it was about 45 minutes longer, I've been in a lot of anticipation for it.

Let's get out of the way the things I would've changed. Unless my mind has been playing tricks on me, there weren't as many songs in the original; I think the scene with Ariel sad and not understanding Eric's sudden move away from her was more effective when we just had her sniffling to listen to. There could've been about 10 minutes shaved off, or maybe replaced with talking a bit more about the history of humans and merpeople. The atmosphere tickled my curiosity. I felt sometimes Sebastian's new voice, Daveed Diggs, was in the beginning noticeably second-guessing tones, but he gains his footing relatively quickly. I don't really have many true gripes with this movie in the slightest.

Everyone was in a true spirit here. It was definitely a challenge to keep up the trend of making their iconic animal (or china) characters live action, and even if Scuttle, Sebastian and Flounder look different from how they originally were, they manage to keep their likability, especially with Awkwafina's bubbly performance. Jonah Hauer-King is a dreamboat as Eric, innocent, adventurous and, as Ariel put it, compassionate and kind. Not to mention cute. It's no wonder Ariel would fall for him. Melissa McCarthy is a lot of fun as the sea witch, which we find out twice, first in her ""Unfortunate Souls"" and the other when she's screaming to find the potion to give her an advantage in her deal with Ariel.

The movie is lovely to look at; there's so many ""how-did-they-pull-those-off""s as the camera swims around an underwater paradise that balances the dangers and the beauty of the coral, caves, plants and creatures. You know, the actual Under The Sea song is meant to feel like a vacation out on the beach, and the stunning shots of the shores and the kingdom, sunsets and rises, markets and parties, all feel like we're down in the Caribbean.

But this movie obviously belongs to Halle Bailey. It's no wonder that after she auditioned, no one else could really live up to what she brought. The original Ariel was just like how she is; curious, innocent, unrelenting in both departments, and wishing the world could be less fearful and more willing to come together. And just listening to her singing, how is it possible not to see her as The Little Mermaid herself?

The chemistry between her and Hauer-King is just right. You can tell the two of them appreciated the story of these characters finding someone they love, who loves them right back. After everything, the movie will probably leave you hopeful for romance.

Now, as is expected, this movie has songs in typical Disney format. So in other words, there are a fair few songs throughout its 2-hour 15-minute runtime. And there's a scene involving a shark and Ursula's moray eels are more than a little chilling for some kids. If everyone is ready for all that, The Little Mermaid is a movie the whole family is sure to love. Grade: B+"
"BoooringThe new Little Mermaid movie, despite its highly anticipated release, left me utterly disappointed and disengaged. From start to finish, the film was a soulless attempt to cash in on nostalgia, devoid of any charm or imagination. It pains me to say that this adaptation not only failed to capture the magic of the original animated classic but also presented a shallow and unconvincing storyline.

First and foremost, the film suffered from a lackluster script. The dialogue felt uninspired, with characters delivering lines without any depth or emotional resonance. The new rendition of Ariel, played by an underwhelming lead, lacked the captivating charisma that made the character so beloved. It was as if the writers simply threw together a collection of clichés and expected the audience to be enthralled.

Furthermore, the pacing was incredibly sluggish, leaving me frequently checking my watch in search of something to rekindle my interest. The movie seemed to drag on with little regard for keeping viewers engaged. Scenes that should have been pivotal and emotionally charged fell flat, as the film failed to build any genuine sense of tension or excitement.

To make matters worse, the visuals were disappointingly lackluster. The filmmakers seemingly neglected the opportunity to create a breathtaking underwater world that could transport audiences to a realm of wonder. Instead, the visuals appeared cheap and unimaginative, failing to capture the ethereal beauty that defined the original animated masterpiece.

Perhaps most frustratingly, the movie lacked any real character development. Secondary characters were mere caricatures, offering nothing more than superficial comic relief without contributing meaningfully to the plot. Even the iconic villain, Ursula, felt diminished and devoid of the sinister charisma that made her such a memorable antagonist.

In conclusion, the new Little Mermaid movie proved to be a disastrous attempt to revive a beloved classic. With a lackluster script, sluggish pacing, uninspiring visuals, and shallow characterizations, the film failed to capture the essence of the original, leaving me thoroughly bored and unengaged. For fans of the timeless animated gem, this adaptation is a disappointing betrayal of their cherished memories. Save your time and revisit the animated version instead; it remains far superior in every aspect."
"50% of Funny Part, 50% of Boring PartI had watched this movie just now. My feeling to this movie is - this Mermaid movie is more with Anderson's colour than Disney's colour.

If this is an Anderson's Mermaid story, I could say it will be successful. But, as a Disney Princess Movie, it is just a ""Pass"" for me.

I like the Anderson's quote in the Introduction. I get it. And this is quite interesting for me. At least it's bringing new values to this movie.

But I found quite boring to the copied scene as the 2D- The Little Mermaid. Because it doesn't bring more impact to impress the audience.

Halle Bailey can be a mermaid, but maybe not Ariel, because Ariel's frame make her being underestimated. She can be more than just Ariel.

And the Prince Eric, his character is more complete in this movie and I get to know him more than just a charming prince.

So, I rate this movie for 5/10 and I hope to see Disney movie more than just Copy-Paste remake. Thank you."
"Best Remake yet, pure DisneySo being a Disney fan was very dubious about this was concerned about the animation, songs casting and Disney feel to it. Basically worried it was going to be like the Mulan remake, which was terrible. No songs, total change of story and felt nothing like a Disney.

However how surprised was I. The animation was not overdone or too realistic, perfectly pitched. The film felt very Disney, colourful and the cast was great. This for me was the best Disney live remake yet. It was never going to be the 'original' but my god did they nail it. The only small negative I could see was Prince Eric's song; it was a just a little too broadway. That aside still a 10/10 from me. Loved it."
"Disappointingly ShallowAs a fan of Disney films, I was genuinely excited to watch the highly acclaimed ""Little Mermaid."" However, my experience left me thoroughly disappointed and underwhelmed. Here's why:

First and foremost, the plot of ""Little Mermaid"" is incredibly shallow and lacks depth. The story revolves around Ariel, a young mermaid who dreams of exploring the human world. While this premise holds promise, the execution falls flat. The characters are one-dimensional, failing to evoke any real emotional connection. The film focuses so heavily on the superficial aspects of Ariel's desire for legs that it neglects to explore the deeper implications or consequences of her choices.

Furthermore, the pacing of the movie feels rushed and haphazard. Important events and character developments are glossed over, leaving the audience with a disjointed narrative. Key relationships, such as Ariel's connection with her father and her bond with her underwater friends, lack the necessary development to truly resonate with viewers.

One of the biggest letdowns in ""Little Mermaid"" is the musical aspect. Disney is renowned for its memorable and enchanting songs, but the soundtrack of this film falls short. The musical numbers lack the catchiness and emotional impact of previous Disney classics. They are forgettable and fail to leave a lasting impression.

Another notable flaw lies in the film's messaging. ""Little Mermaid"" attempts to convey themes of self-discovery and the pursuit of dreams. However, the movie's underlying message seems to be that sacrificing one's identity and voice for the sake of love is acceptable. This problematic notion undermines the empowering ideals that Disney movies are often known for, sending a questionable message to impressionable viewers.

Visually, ""Little Mermaid"" is vibrant and colorful, showcasing beautiful animation. However, this eye-catching aspect alone cannot redeem the film from its lackluster storytelling and character development.

In conclusion, ""Little Mermaid"" is a disappointment compared to the high standards set by Disney's previous animated films. Its shallow plot, rushed pacing, forgettable music, and questionable messaging overshadow any visual appeal it may have had. For those seeking a truly engaging and emotionally resonant Disney experience, I would recommend looking elsewhere."
"The best Disney live action adaptationI was sceptical about this movie, but it was absolutely perfect. Halle Bailey was the perfect choice for Ariel and she was incredible in this role. Her and Eric's actor had so much chemistry and the romance was very believable. They kept 99% of the original animated movie, with just a few changes, which made it very nostalgic in the best way. They kept the songs which I was thrilled about, I felt like a little kid again watching The Little Mermaid for the first time. It is the best Disney live action adaption in my opinion, absolutely worth the watch. It is a shame this movie got so much hate before even being released, it is absolutely perfect in my opinion."
Wasn't even close to the originalThe graphics were good but to many changes should of just done a spin off. My kids really didn't seem into it and lost their attention by the end of it. Disney could have done this movie 100 different ways. The characters were all done well graphic wise and the plot trends with the orginal but the over all aspect and feel of the movie was completely off. If your ever my honest opinion just wait until the movie reaches some sort of stream service that you already pay for and enjoy the movie that way. All of the professional critics have it about a 5 out of 10 across the board. Again a new story line and spin off would have been much better.
"ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT!Took my daughter and son to see this version knowing that it would be slightly different from the animated version. I was excited to see the changes and they didn't disappoint. The new songs are catchy and fun, Halle was phenomenal, and the film overall was great. We thought Scuttle was adorable and Sabastian was hilarious! This is the 2nd live action of an animation that I've liked, the other was Aladdin. I typically don't enjoy the live action remakes.

We saw the movie in Real 3D and I highly recommend. There are lots of scenes that make the seats vibrate and that just enhances the movie effects. Such a great addition!"
"HmmThe only part that my 6 year old daughter liked was Ursula. My 16 year old didn't care for the movie much, she thought flounder, Sebastian and scuttle was just wrong looking. Melissa McCarthy played the part very well. Everything else was just okay. Ariel's hair wasn't really red and when your youngest looks at you and say ""she pretty but she's not the real Ariel mom, where's the red hair?"" The best thing about the movie was Ursula. At least they didn't ruin her. Disney needs to be coming up with new original movie ideas, than redoing the old classics. Or not making the live action movies too long to where the kids are playing in the isles. I thought the movie was just okay...."
"Not as bad as they say.Okay, I watched the film despite the negative review bombing out of curiosity & tried to remain unbiased. So here is my take.

It is nowhere near as good as the live action Cinderella, but it is better than the live action Mulan.

The movie lacks the bright colors & some iconic moments which I feel Disney simply didn't want to shell out the cash for animation costs. It's a mermaid movie with barely any mermaids in it. Some additions to character development were a good effort.

But if you're looking for an exact replication of the original movie... this IS NOT IT. But kids will probably enjoy it."
"OutstandingSaw this at the cinema in 3D and it was outstanding. I grew up on the original and it was everything I hoped for with some great changes that I felt added much more to the story. Thoroughly enjoyed it. The story was great, the action sequences were phenomenal and the actors playing Ariel, Eric and Ursula were the standouts for me. Very very young kids might find some scenes a little scary as its very realistic graphics. Loved the expansion of the island culture too. Highly recommend to fans of the original Great job! Would absolutely watch it more than once. Lived up to the original and then some!"

"Easily the best remake so farThis version of the little mermaid was easily the best of the remakes so far. They added some new things without trying to change too much, Bailey's performance was fantastic and the chemistry between her and Hauer-King was believable which made you want them to succeed even more. This is also the most I've enjoyed a Melissa McCarthy performance in a really long time. There were a couple changes that seemed unnecessary like Ariel not being able to remember she needed to get the prince to kiss her but otherwise most of the changes were for the better if they were noticeable at all. I know a lot of people complain about the lighting under the sea and everything but I think it was colorful and bright when it needed to be to show what Ariel was missing out or going to be missing out on with the land and the sea. I understood the saturation choices for the different scenes. The CGI was off putting at times but it didn't take too much suspension of disbelief to move past it."
"Mediocre at bestWhere to begin, they took a children's classic and dragged it out for like an additional 45 mins without adding any meaningful content.

The songs were enjoyable in a quick YouTube video kind of way but seemed low effort for a blockbuster film.

The acting was some of the worst I've ever seen, the CGI was watchable but with a $250M budget I would assume it would be better.

Overall Disney dropped the ball here, it all seemed rushed and any real connection to characters was traded for 99% of everything being CGI ""wow factor"". Top it all off with the fact the movie was interrupted by a fight in the seats....

2/10."
"Little mermaid live actionBest live action movie from Disney Amazingly well done, Loved the new scenes added and the new characters.

Loved the new songs added to it

Halle Bailey is just an angel in that movie with a beautiful voice.

She gave so much soul in those songs who were perfectly interpreted by such a young women of color.

Congratulations to the whole crew.

Will watch it over and over.

Little mermaid is an epic Disney movie that we all waited so long to see on screen, Rob Marshall did an amazing job.

I will recommend that movie to all with no moderations.

I rank this movie 10/10 not because that i am fan of the little mermaid but because they actually respected the entire story and add some scenes to our modern world who includes all races and it was just beautiful to watch."
"It was okay but a bit boring!Wish I could liiiiiive back in the 80s-90s. I think Disney should stop live action movies. Disney used to be about magic and deep messages about love. Now it seems like everything is flat. The last movies I watched from Disney and made me cry and feel something was Raya and the last dragon and Encanto. Also, seemed like the actors didn't really fit the roles except King Triton. Unlike beauty and the beast or Aladdin. Much better role match and plot. My daughter watched it with me and she also said she was bored and somehow scared. Eventhough she loves Disney and good kids movies. Please bring back the magic. This world needs it."
"Lost the magicI love live remakes, and the little mermaid is my favourite Disney movie. So I had high expectations. But unlike the original, that make me cry every time I watch it, I think the live action lost its magic.

With other live actions, I think that the development of the story make it even more magical. But here they focus so much in make a realistic and modern movie, that all they got was to strip all the magic all of it. Despite trying I couldn't get involved .

They changed music that didn't need to be change ( everyone knew the context), the changed several details that didn't need to be change. And in the end, the modifications made even less sense. The dresses... why cut all the beautiful dresses??

The effects under water, well that's hard to do, but wasn't very good.

I like they way they develop the relationship between Eric and Ariel. But at the same time, Eric was so boring....

Anyway, for summarise... I didn't fell it. I didn't feel the magic, and for me that's all Disney was supposed to be about."
"Yes , we have a new Ariel.Before watching the movie I went through all the reviews, and quite a few were negative, especially from top critics. I can now tell it's all nonsense: if feels like the remarks came from someone who either sat in the theater minding their own business, or watched the movie determined to dislike it no matter what, and just rushed a few sentences based on nothing but prejudice. The movie does have flaws, quite not the ones it's been argued about though. And it's shockingly confusing!

First of all, this is a good-mood movie for kids by Disney and it gracefully does the job. Did it need extra work? Yes indeed, both edit and cgi. You just feel this is a very enjoyable movie that needs a few little changes to reach perfection in its category.

Halle Bailey delivers a rich range of emotions and a heart-melting singing performance. Melissa McCarthy boosts Ursula to next-level evil and her rendition of Poor Unfortunate Souls is deliciously entertaining. Jonah Hauer-King builds a charmingly specular character to Ariel, and their romance gets engagingly real. The plot changes are very smart and help the comedic ambition of Ariel's sidekicks, that ultimately survive real-life transposition (with room for improvement tbh but hey, that's quite an achievement already).

Let's come to the flaws. The transition from one scene to the next underwater lacks of depth. There's no sense of time and I blame it on the edit.

The new songs have less soul compared to the original material but do not feel unnecessary, just a bit rough.

The cgi department needed extra time for what I consider to be a monumental amount of work. Nobody can expect that to be perfect.

Triton holds back at times. In such a short screen time you probably wanna see him go a little bigger.

Costumes up above are fine but do not support the storyline.

The movie never felt too long and I really enjoyed every minute. I do agree this is the best live-action adaptation of a Disney animated classic to date (excluding Cinderella, that had quite a different approach)."
"My favorite Disney live action remake so far!I adored everything about this movie. The cast is stellar. Halle Bailey is such a gift as Ariel. From ""Part of Your World"" on, she had my heart! Melissa McCarthy was fantastic and funny as Ursula.

I loved the visuals. The new songs fit in very well with the classic songs. I appreciated that the filmmakers stuck so close to the animated version on smaller details, it made this movie both new and nostalgic for me. I loved the ending as well, it didn't feel as rushed as I always felt the animated movie ending was. Yes, 10/10! And I'm going to see it again in the theater, that's how much I loved it!"
"Expectations were blown out of the sea.The best Disney live action I have ever seen! I had low expectations, but they were completely blown out of the sea.

The songs (old & new) were captivating and fun, the visuals were stunning, the cast and acting was stellar, and the story has so much more depth and richness!

Halle Bailey does a wonderful job of conveying her thoughts and emotions as Ariel without being able to speak.

Melissa is terrifyingly wicked as Ursula.

Jonah gives so much life and personality to Eric.

Scuttle, Sebastion and Flounder are the perfect trio.

Absolutely loved this movie, dare I say, a lot more than the original.

I'm definitely going to watch it again!"
"Really cute, light, and full of talent!!This movie is beautiful to look at and even more beautiful to hear the angelic sounds of Halle Bailey's voice! She was made for this role and she knocked it out of the park. I enjoyed the new song she sung, but the song sang by Scuttle wasn't my favorite. Overall, this movie is a good time and I think they did a really good job of capturing the essence of the original while making updates. I'm not sure where all they hate for this film is coming from. 1989 Ariel's skin tone or hair color are not relevant to the story AT ALL so who cares. Also, people are ranting as is the original film has somehow disappeared. You all can simply logon to Disney+ and watch there 💜"
"As a long time Little Mermaid fan...I'm someone who even slept with an Ariel life sized pillow when I was a child...and had a little mermaid alarm clock all the way through high school...and I LOVED IT! Halle Bailey's voice was perfect. She is a gorgeous Ariel. And the rest of the cast was awesome. I was surprised that Ursula was so well casted...such a great choice to play a villain My favorite surprise was noticing the diversity of the daughters! Because of that wonderful choice in casting, I got to tell a little 3 yr old Asian girl, that there was a mermaid that looked like her in the movie! I truly loved it...and am glad they gave Eric a rich backstory."
"National Geographic episodeStunning visuals, absolute wonderful use of colors. I was skeptical about the two main leads, but Bailey and Hauer-King put a delightful spin to the original characters of Ariel and Eric. I loved the little message about coral reefs and how they fixed the main messages of the movie to a more healthier version for kids. The songs are catchy enough to sing along to. Eric's song was surprising, but was also well-served for his character arc. The best parts were the sparkling scenes between Eric and Ariel, buzzing with chemistry. The worst parts- the underperformance of Triton as the mighty king of the seas and Ursula's vicious villainy."
"Gorgeous, Magical DelightA genuine delight! Not only the best of the Disney live action remakes, but an all around gorgeous film. It ranks alongside Disney's Cinderella (2015) that balances the old with the new. It honors well the best parts of the original film, while expanding upon the story with new thrills, new arcs, and new songs. Every change and addition serves the film extremely well. The entire cast rises to the occasion, but none more so than Halle Bailey as Ariel. She is exquisite in every way. Her voice is magic. Her acting embodies the wonder, curiosity, hopes, dreams, and heart of Ariel. She is a perfect Ariel. Prince Eric is a revelation as well. His character has much added depth compared to his animated counterpart. So much of his story ends up being his, in the best way. His desires, frustrations, dreams, and longing all run parallel to Ariel. They're kindred spirits, and in being so their romance becomes far more layered and sincere. You believe in that instant love, and root for it wholeheartedly.

There is so much to love in this film, from its music to its nostalgic tale, The Little Mermaid makes a grand splash, whose siren call you won't forget any time soon."
"Disneys best live action!A total home run! Casting was brilliant and so thoughtful. Not only in doing so in a richly diverse way, but they also got truly excellent actors and musical theater singers. They didn't fall into the trap of casting for names. Halle Bailey and Jonah Hauer-Kong are skilled actors with powerful vocals (and sing in the musical theater style which other movie musicals think you don't need).

Rob Marshall's direction was fine with love for the original while also taking it a different, live movie version appropriate. He clearly did not want to go cartoony, so while there were a lot of choices that mimicked the original, there were others that made really smart adjustments to keep it in a more realistic, slightly darker world. There were lines here and there that added so much depth to both Ariel and Eric's character.

It's magical and perfectly executed- from choreography, to diverse representation, hair design, acting, singing, and direction. I can't wait to see it again!"
"Don't Trust the Negative ReviewsThis movie is pure Disney magic.

I was so nervous to see this because I wanted to love it but have been disappointed in the other live action adaptations. I was delighted to find that it exceeded my hopes!

It is visually stunning.


Halle brought a depth and fierceness to Ariel that made me sympathize deeply with her position and motivation whereas before I just felt confused about why she would take such a risk.




100% improvement and my new favorite Disney movie!"
"good movieMy Review - The Little Mermaid My Rating- 9/10

At long last a Disney live action feature film reimagining of a much loved previous animated Disney classic that's not a dud like the recent Pinocchio and Dumbo .

The Little Mermaid is a triumph for Director Rob Marshall who's previous film treatments of musicals like Chicago 2002 Into The Woods 2014 and Disney's Mary Poppins Returns 2018 I've completely forgiven him for his treatment of Nine in 2005.

All the cast in The Little Mermaid shines like the beam from a Lighthouse but the shining star in my view is Halle Bailey as Ariel the mermaid who longs to experience what life is like on land with the Prince she rescues from drowning.

Halle Bailey's debut in this estimated $200million musical feature movie is inspired as she is a relatively little known star name but I'm confident that this movie will change that .

Halle's casting and performance in The Little Mermaid reminded me of two other examples of relatively little known actresses who were perfectly cast in their roles they are two Marias's Julie Andrews in The Sound of Music and more recently Rachel Zegler in West Side Story.

The original score by composers Alan Menken and Howard Ashman with much-loved composers Alan Menken and Howard Ashman plus four new songs, with lyrics by Hamilton composer Lin - Manuel Miranda all add to the spectacle .

My favourites are the three great numbers Part of Your World sung beautifully by Halle Bailey ,Poor Unfortunate Souls with additional lyrics by Lin - Manuel Miranda sung and performed with devilish delight by Melissa McCarthy .

Of course the great production number Under The Sea earns a screen credit for the famous Alvin Ailey Dance Foundation who came on board to assist Rob Marshall it truly is a triumph of live action and stunning animation.

The rest of the featured cast includes Jonah Hauer-King as the handsome Prince Eric who impresses Ariel enough to rescue him and save his life . Lin -Manuel Miranda's new song for him to sing Wild Uncharted Waters fits into the plot beautifully and is well sung.

The two well known box office stars are Melissa McCarthy as Ursula the Sea Witch enchantress who bewitches Ariel stealing her voice but granting her legs to enter the human world. Special mention must be made at this point to praise the superb costumes worn by Ursula, all the mermaids ,King Triton and all the human cast members of The Little Mermaid that are beautifully designed by Colleen Atwood a four time Oscar Winner.

Ariel has only 3 sunsets to win the love of Prince Eric with a kiss or return to the sea and become her slave .

Javier Bardem is commanding in his role as King Triton Ariel's kind but strict father who's sister Ursula wants to crush him in revenge for her banishment with her tentacles.

I found the CGI special effects very impressive perhaps a little dark in parts but equal to anything I've seen recently."

"Halle is perfect in reminding us what Disney is.This movie perfectly captures what it is to be a Disney movie and not only that but what it is to be a remake. So much fun and talent in one movie it almost made me think it was too good to be true.

Halle is so talented and beautiful it hurts and the rest of the cast enchants you. I will not hear a bad thing about this film, however I recommend you experience the magic yourself.

The songs new and old have an amazing twist and with the casts talents it's no suprise they are already streamed by millions so far.

So my recommendation to you is to take a chance and view this film, and you might even find yourself one of the admirers."
"AmazingBest live action Disney movie ever. My girls and I will be seeing it again. The story line, the characters and absolutely the music were all hands down the best. Halle really nailed this one and I hope this movie gets the recognition that it deserves. From beginning to end my children were enthralled. All of the actors did an amazing job, the casting was great.. King Tritan was wonderful as well and Ursula delivered. As someone who loved the original I was not disappointed and absolutely love this one too. Great version for the new generation to see and fall in love with and for the older generation to have a new found love for as well."

"Beautiful, Ethereal, New and FreshThis movie exceeded all of my expectations. From the stunning visuals to the captivating new but familiar plot, this movie truly has it all.

The underwater scenes were absolutely gorgeous, and the clothes, hair, makeup, and places were incredibly well done. It truly felt like I was transported into that magical world.

I was particularly impressed with the way the directors were able to modernize the story while still staying somewhat true to the original. Even though I lowkey missed some parts from the animated version, I absolutely enjoyed and loved the new additions here. And its commitment to diversity. The cast is refreshingly diverse, featuring actors from a wide range of ethnic backgrounds. This not only adds an important element of representation to the film but also makes the story feel more authentic and inclusive.

And of course, I have to give a special shoutout to Halle Bailey's singing voice. She absolutely nailed every song in the movie, bringing a fresh and modern take to some classic tunes. Her voice is so ethereal. Her rendition of ""Part of Your World"" and even her version of ""Vanessa's Trick"" gave me chills and brought tears to my eyes.

Overall, I would highly recommend The Little Mermaid to anyone looking for a new, visually stunning, engaging, and diverse movie that will capture your heart from beginning to end.

Diversity and inclusion are never bad when done properly, it doesn't affect the plot or character here, different versions can exist, and we can choose our favorite and ignore the others."
"Not dark at all!I don't understand the reviews saying the film was dark or hard to see, the underwater scenes were vibrant and stunning and the CGI was the best I've ever seen for underwater. The lighting being realistic as she goes deeper made perfect sense. I LOVED this film, I'll go back and see it 6 more times. I don't know how people could be bored, the audience I saw it with all burst into applause when the credits rolled. Wonderful casting, the prince was authentic and unpretentious, Halle was a shining light, Melissa McCarthy did an incredible job, especially for never having sung before. The added Caribbean atmosphere made a colourful and lively movie on shore. My only real complaints are that it was probably a bit too long, because the ending started to lose steam, and for such a lush and beautiful film, Ariel's dresses on land were very cheap looking and didn't even match the wardrobe of everyone else, where did she even get these dresses? That was a shame, because Colleen Atwood is one of my top costume designers and could really have put Ariel in gorgeous period dresses."

"Nostalgic and Beautiful!Simply amazing. Halle was born to play Ariel, there's no question about it!!!! Javier Bardem had a great presence as King Triton. Loved seeing the sisters. Wished it had more Flounder. Sebastian stole the show. Scuttle was surprisingly funny, specially when paired up with Sebastian. Ursula, wow, she was so cool, so evil, and once again I wanted more. Prince Eric stole my heart, maybe it's the dimples. His song fit perfectly with the rest of the movie. The movie had a few moments that made me jump. It reminded me so much of the Disney movie, but then it expanded the story beautifully.

Halle...MY GOD...everything screamed Ariel!!! Amazing!"
"Did the cartoon justice!I had high hopes for this movie and it exceeded my expectations! I watched the cartoon like every day of my childhood, so I was nervous it wouldn't turn out as well as I hoped. The little changes they made definitely worked. I thought it was very well cast and the cinematography was dreamy. I even loved the extra songs when I usually resent them - especially Scuttlebutt! All the characters were great, but Awkwafina and Daveed Diggs really played off one another well and added levity. Halle Bailey was wonderful and Part of Your World was SO GOOD. So was Under the Sea. My one gripe is Poor Unfortunate Souls skipped an entire verse and that song is perfection so I'm not sure why they made that choice. All in all, bravo Disney! Another winner."
"Absolutely beautifulHalle is fantastic and she is Ariel , the entire movie made me smile and I didn't even notice the changes in the songs , the cast is perfect I love the sisters and I felt a little sorry for flounder but he was so cute I wish he had more parts, scuttle made me laugh I love Akwafina , Sebastian was great too it was great seeing his sassy self again , I didn't mind the darkness of the film either I loved it all. I cried and laughed highly recommend bravos.

I can't wait to see the movie again in my own home or perhaps in the movie theater again cuz it was a great fun super cool experience and the film was great and the characters are amazing."

"A magic movieThe best Disney live action, full of magic and emotions! Halle and Jonah are perfect Ariel and Eric! They really have chemical. I really loved the cast, the music, the cgi. The peaks of the movie are Under the sea (full of colors and funny), Kiss the girl (really sweet) and all the scenes between Ariel and Eric. Melissa is great as Ursula. I wish Ariel's sister had more space in the movie and the movie missed at least one iconic scene of the original movie but has some more scenes about Eric, wich were great. Not a perfect movie but it has the same magic of the original one. I watched it 3 times at the cinema!"
"Excellent movie!I loved every minute! Halle Bailey was phenomenal !! Daveed Diggs was so great as Sebastian! Loved the added songs and Melissa McCarthy topped it off! They graphics were awesome! It's obvious no live action will ever take the place of the original but it's just magical to see these cartoons come to life. And they did it in a wonderful way. No complaints here! Has a smile on my face the whole time! Some of the backlash was hysterical and totally uncalled for. This is a Children's movie. It is whimsical, funny and moving. The acting was spot on. The costumes clothes and added scenes only enhanced the film. I'm definitely seeing it Again!"
"Better than expectedI went to see the film with little expectation based on many of the other soulless Disney live action remakes combined with mixed reviews. However I was pleasantly surprised.

There's plenty of soul and feeling with a great performance from Halle Bailey as well as solid performances from Javier Bardem and Melissa McCarthy.

It is a bit too long for a children's film in my opinion with quite a few slow paced scenes that could be a bit laboured for younger children.

All in all a decent effort that puts it above most of the other live action Disney remakes. Whilst I can completely understand the negative reviews and the film is laboured in parts, the performances and classic songs lift it enough to be a worthwhile watch.

My advice if you're not sure is to wait until it's released on Disney Plus."
"Solid Stand Alone Movie. Worth Checking OutI was actually very surprised how much I liked this movie. The original was one of my favorite movies when I was a kid, so my expectations were high. I'm very happy that I wasn't disappointed.

While it stays faithful to the original, it isn't a carbon copy the way they did it with the Lion King. Those who have read the Hans Christian Andersen fairytale will be able to point out all the ""nods"" to the story that have been woven into the plot, as well as nods to mermaid lore. I really appreciated that.

Halle Bailey steals the show as Ariel. She did an amazing job and her version of ""Part Of Your Word"" is out of this world.

Melissa McCarthy does a great job as Ursula. She really made Ursula her own, and didn't try to do an imitation of Pat Carroll. Her version of ""Poor Unfortunate Souls"" was also really well done.

Jonah Hauer-King is excellent as Eric. He has a more thought out story, more depth, and has has great chemistry with Bailey.

My top 3 songs in this movie: 1. Part Of Your World 2. Poor Unfortunate Souls 3. Under The Sea The Skuttlebutt ""rap"" was god awful. They should have cut it.

I went to see this movie in 3D (for some reason it was the only option in my theater), and I didn't mind it. If you DON'T see it in 3D, you won't be missing out. I want to see it again on a regular movie screen to compare. I think the 3D was a bit distracting."
"Better than expectedDisney has been failing me... yes.. I'm just talking about me... it has been failing me with its live action movies. Don't even get me started on the Lion King. No ""Be Prepared""! You killing me smalls...

But this move was pretty good. Skittle and Sebastian was the highlights. Took my kids to watch it. My daughter loved it. My son... 🤣. But it stuck to the script. I believe in live action adaptations, you should never take away, only add. And it did a wonderful job of that. Aquafina was the perfect choice to play Skuttle. It's hard for me to give movies 10s. I can't believe I'm giving this one a 9, but it's well deserved. Great job Disney!"
"I loved this live-action remake!I watched Disney's The Little Mermaid animation hundreds of times in my childhood. Despite the negative public reactions toward the movie release photos and supporting character designs, I think Disney has done a wonderful job re-making the beloved animation into a live action movie. I am amazed at how beautiful the mermaids look, the advanced visual effects technology successfully made the under water scenes look believable. I imagine it is challenging to make the actors look like they are naturally swimming underwater and talking. Of course, hats off to Halle Bailey and her undeniable singing and acting talent. This re-make mostly stays true to the animation, which a true Disney fan would appreciate, except for some scenes. It is definitely worth watching if you are a big little mermaid fan like me, the challenge is to not sing along loudly to our favorite songs in the cinema."
"A beautiful love story!!As time changes, it's wonderful that Disney made a great beautiful love story that reflects the whole world. It was so beautiful to see all ethnicities and origins reflected in this movie. Children all over the world can see themselves in one of the characters, especially at the end. Disney showed how love conquers evil. I really hope that parents who are against this movie because the lead character does not look like the fictional cartoon character. I'm really saddened if they are disallowed to enjoy such a beautiful movie because of how the parents feel and not how they feel. Halle Bailey was superb in the role of Ariel. All I saw was a girl from the sea who wasn't allowed to be with humans because of misunderstood biases. She wanted to venture out and be part of another world. She fell in love with the boy from a different world. Together they fought evil and changed the minds of all those who didn't believe they could get along; but they found out their worlds were not so different. Thank you Disney."
"Simply exceeded my expectations...As an avid fan of the original animated film and a lover of enchanting tales, I had high hopes and expectations for the 2023 live-action adaptation of ""The Little Mermaid."" And boy, did it exceed every single one of them! This modern retelling of the beloved underwater fairytale captured my heart from the very first frame and never let go.

One of the most remarkable aspects of the film is the exceptional casting. Halle Bailey shines as Ariel, bringing a refreshing and vibrant energy to the character. Her voice is angelic, capturing the essence of Ariel's longing and determination. Bailey's portrayal is both relatable and empowering, making Ariel a timeless symbol of resilience and following one's dreams.

The supporting cast is equally impressive. Melissa McCarthy delivers a standout performance as the villainous Ursula, infusing the character with equal parts menace and dark humor. Javier Bardem brings depth and complexity to the role of King Triton, showcasing the internal struggle between love and duty. And let's not forget the comedic genius of Awkwafina as Scuttle, who provides endless laughter and entertainment. And let me not forget Daveed Diggs as the brilliant voice of one my favorite characters, Sébastian! His take on the role ws brilliant.

Visually, ""The Little Mermaid"" is an absolute feast for the eyes. The underwater world is brought to life with stunning cinematography and awe-inspiring special effects. From the breathtaking coral reefs to the majestic kingdom of Atlantica, every frame is a testament to the film's meticulous attention to detail. The vibrant color palette, combined with the ethereal musical sequences, creates a truly immersive experience that transports the audience into a magical realm beneath the waves.

The film's soundtrack is a treasure trove of enchanting melodies, both reimagined classics and brand-new compositions. With the return of Alan Menken, the genius behind the original film's iconic songs, and the addition of new talents such as Lin-Manuel Miranda, the music of ""The Little Mermaid"" is a symphony of emotion. From the heartwarming ""Part of Your World"" to the show-stopping ""Poor Unfortunate Souls,"" each musical number captures the essence of the characters and their journeys.

What truly sets this adaptation apart is its commitment to inclusivity and representation. By casting Halle Bailey as Ariel, the film embraces diversity and offers a powerful message of acceptance and breaking barriers. The story explores themes of identity, self-discovery, and the importance of finding one's voice. It's a timely and relevant narrative that resonates deeply with audiences of all ages, making ""The Little Mermaid"" a true celebration of individuality and empowerment.

In conclusion, the 2023 adaptation of ""The Little Mermaid"" is a magnificent triumph. It honors the spirit of the beloved animated classic while introducing new elements and captivating performances that make it a standout cinematic experience. With its spellbinding visuals, memorable music, and a talented cast that brings the characters to life, this film is an absolute must-see for fans of all ages. Prepare to be enchanted and swept away on a mesmerizing underwater adventure like no other."
"I Loved ItI absolutely love this version of The Little Mermaid. I think the entire cast did a great job send it was great to sing along to some of my Disney faves. Some parts of the movie differ from the original but that was ok with me. Everyone I went with enjoyed the movie, it held my attention and I'll certainly go and see it again in the theater. Halle Bailey can sing so beautifully, Melissa McCarthy delivered an amazing performance as well. Overall I really love the move though I thought it was a little long. A few of the songs were new to me and I enjoyed them too. Whoemever played the bird had me cracking up as well. This movie is a must see in my opinion."
Be your own judgeI saw The Little Mermaid twice this past holiday weekend with two different groups of people. Adults and kids. We all enjoyed it. The new songs and song updates are wonderful. The characters are better developed than in the original. I don't think I've ever actually submitted a review but I want to offer something to counter all the negativity. Try to appreciate the creativity that went into years of production. Admire the immensely talented people in it. Value a fresh take on a problematic core story premise. Relax people. It's a movie. Try to put your worries on a back burner for a couple hours and enjoy something.
"Beautiful SingingAriel can sing! The actress playing Ariel sounded like a beautiful siren, filled with emotion. There were moments where I almost started crying because of her voice and the raw emotion behind it. The visuals are amazing and the acting was phenomenal. Absolutely loved it! The actress who played Ursula as a human did a great job. My only criticism is that two hours maybe a little lengthy for little ones but no worries though, it goes by fast. The half an hour previews is what actually makes it seem longer. Again, the actress playing Ariel can sing and Rob Marshal definitely knew what he was doing by casting her."

"BEST Disney live actionHUGE Disney fan and this was my most favourite live action to date! My boyfriend was skeptical coming in but left saying the ""Under the Sea"" song was better than the original! I found the story telling more in depth than the original, explaining their love story more (their cute similarities), her and her fathers relationship and even why there are mixed race mermaids as they hail from all the seven seas! ""Kiss the Girl"" was one of my favourites, plus's the scene racing around in the horse cart and markets. Halle was absolutely perfect, her voice is Ariel through and through. Can't wait to watch again!!"
"Funny and Talented!I saw this movie tonight with my wife, who is a big Little Mermaid fan, and I enjoyed it. I liked the Caribbean take on it and the voice actors for Sebastian and Scuttle. I enjoyed Lin-Manuel's songs and McCarthy's Ursula. I liked Javier Bardem's take on King Triton. In my head I imagined him going No Country For Old Men on Ursula, but I digress. My wife especially enjoyed it and I caught her singing under her breath at times. Great movie. On another note, movies are appreciated different ways and by different opinions, some worse than others. If you hated a movie that much then why go see it or for that matter why rate it poorly? People put in a lot of work to entertain the masses and bad ""it doesn't compare to the original"" reviews are pointless."
"Great movie and experience watching itTitle: A Breathtaking Ocean of Magic: Little Mermaid Live Action Review

As an avid fan of Disney's animated classics, I had the privilege of experiencing the enchanting and visually stunning Little Mermaid Live Action film, and I must say, it's undoubtedly one of the better Disney remakes to date. The film beautifully captures the essence of the beloved animated original while infusing it with fresh, modern elements that make it a true cinematic gem.

"Amazing movie! Watch it in 3D!Had an absolutely incredible movie experience. Usually, I refrain from rating films, but this particular one is an exception that truly blew me away. Halle Bailey's performance was nothing short of magical, and I couldn't help but shed tears when she began singing ""Part of Your World."" Sebastian brought an abundance of laughter, leaving us in fits throughout the entire film. Ursula was nothing short of terrific, and the CGI effects were truly top-notch. Javier Bardem portrayed Triton flawlessly, and his performance was nothing short of perfect. The movie effortlessly captured the timeless Disney magic that we all hold dear. In fact, it's my favorite live-action adaptation thus far! The audience was so moved that they couldn't resist erupting into applause when the movie reached its conclusion."
"Beautiful movie!The Little mermaid has always been my favorite since I was a kid, but now this version is my favorite, from the characters, the songs, the colors everything is perfection. Saw it in 3D and it felt like I was swimming with Ariel . Cried a few times, everyone in the theater clapped when the movie ended, every time a song came people were singing along. What they took, it wasn't needed, what they included, was perfect for the story. Love how I had a version of The Little Mermaid to get obsessed with when I was a kid & now kids has 2 versions to love & be obsessed about them.

If you're still doubting, stop & go see it!"
"Great adaptation!As a HUGE Little Mermaid lover, I found this adaptation to be a great mix of the old and new. With live action adaptations you should expect the creators to take creative liberties while enhancing the original story. The creators of this adaptations did a great job with their creative liberties! Halle Bailey did a great job modernizing Ariel and bringing much needed representation to the screen. The new song also helped enhance the story line. The visuals were amazing! The new storyline explaining Eric's origins helped bridge the gap between his ethnicity and his kingdom. Can't wait to watch it again!"
"A Reimagining that Filled with JoyAs a huge fan of The Little Mermaid animation from Disney, I am so grateful that the movie that I love so much gets a really good adaptation where you really feel the love in the whole movie and you can easily tell that everyone claimed all these iconic characters to be their own

Halle Bailey is beyond magical... I couldn't ask for a better Ariel. Her performance feels surreal and every time she sings, I really have to stop myself from tearing up. I appreciate the soul she gave into this character I love so much and so grateful for her. Every movement, every expression she does, feels truly Ariel. I'm just speechless every time.

Jonag Hauer-King, which I expected to be good, turns out even more amazing and just charming all through the movie. His voice when he sings the new song Wild Uncharted Waters really be living rent free in my mind. It really makes me feel like falling in love again with Prince Eric.

Melissa, Javier, Jacob, Daveed, Awkwafina, are all amazing as well, I'm afraid it would take an essay to talk about each of them.

Although there are scenes that I like better in the original, but it doesn't take away my enjoyment when watching this. The honor for H. C. Andersen in the beginning is so beautiful. If I have to put a complaint, it would be how I want a duet between Eric and Ariel especially after hearing Jonah's voice like we could have had it all >.<

Anyway, I'm just sooo happy that I can feel this much joy after watching it. Really grateful and hope you will love it as much as I do :"")"
FunThis movie was a interesting one. It was very good but there was a few moments where it was not good. The scuttlebutt song was the most random song ever the song with prince eric was probably one of my favourite new songs but still wish it was following the story more. The whole plot with Ursula being king tridents sister was weird and they did flounder wrong with the new one. The best song ever was kiss the girl the way they did the scene had me about to actually cry because it was so good. The whole fight scene with Ursula was actually scary. The whole movie overall was actually good. I was pretty scared when I first saw the trailer because I thought they were gonna change a lot of stuff.
"10월 10일Beautiful movie. My family and I enjoyed it very much. Halle is perfect for the role of Ariel you can literally feel her passion and energy every second while watching. Sebastian was pretty comical as well. Melissa does a great job playing Ursula. I'm not sure who plays Vanessa but she did an amazing job, I was not expecting to like her character as much as I did in this remake but she did fantastic. Overall it was a beautiful movie with a beautiful message of combining two worlds. I would definitely recommend taking your families and little ones to see this on movie night I promise you won't regret it."
"Halle Bailey brought it and so did Melissa McCarthy!!!Let me start off by saying, I'm a tough critic. So when I tell you that this was THE best live action movie Disney has made in years, I mean it!

Halle Bailey's portrayal of Ariel was a breath of fresh air. She made it her own without stealing the essence of the animated Ariel we all love. Her vocals gave me chills. She's a very talented performer indeed!

Melissa McCarthy as Ursula? She brought down the house!!! She was the best Ursula I could have ever hoped for. She pushed the normal comedy act aside and became the iconic villain we all love to hate. She showed her talents as an actress and not just the comedian we all love."
"Simply Magical and BeautifulI grew up loving the original little mermaid and this was just a beautiful nod to the original with a modern twist where almost every little girl could see themselves as one of the princesses of the sea. :) Halle was just lit up the screen and her voice was beautiful. Sebastian and Skuttle will make you laugh out loud! I also loved how they made the kingdom a Caribbean land full of beautiful cultures and music. The length was just right and really told the story without being too long. Around 2 hours I think is just right for a movie. The music is awesome, paying tribute to the old while adding in some new favorites. The primary story line was also true to the original, but really sweet with a modern twist where you may even get a little teary eyed. So happy I got to share this magical beautiful movie with my girls :)"

"Are you guys even watching the same movie?This live action was the absolute BEST live action I've watched. The storylines were beautiful as well as the twists. Halle Bailey did an amazing job playing Ariel. Melissa McCarthy playing Ursula did too. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion but I'm starting to think a lot of these people rating the live action movie didn't even fully watch it. Most likely bias ratings based off what's visually in front of them. Definitely would rate this movie higher than a 10. It pulled so many emotional strings and was amazing, this is coming from an OG Little Mermaid fan who went to blockbuster and rented it out continuously as a kid."

"Flawless take on a classic that only improves on the original.I enjoyed this new version fork start to finish. Halle Bailey was perfection as Ariel. She captured the essence of the original beautifully. Melissa Mcarthy and the three animal sidekicks were hilarious. You have to have a lot of hate in your heart not to enjoy this movie. Bravo to all the cast and crew. My inner child cried happy tears seeing this live action version.

My only criticism was prince Erick did not quite live up to my expectations but I still enjoyed his performance. I also would have like to see the other mermaids a bit more. The renditions of the original songs were a delight and a couple of the new ones were fantastic. Can't wait to watch this movie again."
"Better than originalDisney nailed this remake. I'm not a fan of remaking the classics live action could never recapture animation magic without it looking goofy. They added to the story and made it better. Personally the only disappointment was Sebastian, it's hard to make a realistic looking crab show emotion without the previous said goofiness. My daughters favorite song was The Scuttlebutt . Mellisa McCarthy was Ursula couldn't imagine another actress pulling off the live action adaption than her. My daughters who are the target audience couldn't get enough of the movie. They already begging to go back to see it."
AmazingOk it was amazing I honestly didn't think I'd enjoy but her voice is amazing. So emotional. Also I just think that the song scuttlebut was kind of annoying. But my grown adult dad laughed in the movie so clearly it was funny and good. The songs were amazing the visuals were good. I just find that there could've been more but besides that it's beautiful. Maybe the visuals could've been more colourful but in my opinion it was good. I love how Ariel would sing in the background of sone other songs. And wow under the sea was amazing the visuals the fish the dances it was gorgeous. It was a little darker than most Disney movies but still I would recommend.
"Solid Adaptation of the originalI considered myself a hardcore little mermaid and Ursula fan. Going in I was kinda nervous that they might ruin the classic like some of previous remakes, instead i was blown away. From the singing, new add-on songs/scenes/characters' background to the parts/details that they cut of from the original, making this the best live action adaptation yet. Every decision to include or exclude certain elements from the original was carefully thought-out, it doesn't take away the beauty of the original story and it doesn't overbear/boring like if it was taken frame by frame from the original. Halle is a solid singer/actor ""period"". Her performance smacked a lot of rotten eggs on haters' head. People keep picking/mocking on the part where she sing the word ""FREE"", completely blinded by that add-on style of singing/dialogue, they seemed to not understand why it would make sense to keep that cut of the song and missed the other of wonderful things she implemented throughout the song. Melissa's Ursula is chef-kiss. Jonah was perfect as the prince. The whole cast was wonderful. I think people do not give this Sebastian enough credit, sure the animated/realistic crab could be a little better, but Daveed's performance is definitely up there for me. Lastly, if you are going in just to look for something to hate about this film, you gonna hate it, regardless of the other million things they did right, so be open-mind and Hope you enjoy it as much as i did!"
"Great fun.I had a delightful time seeing this film. Halle and Melissa were excellent and the cinematography is gorgeous. Prince Eric was okay but whomever sang his song had a dreadful voice. Everyone else's acting was decent.

The movie runs a bit long, but Halle Bailey's amazing voice won me over big time. Under The Sea has always been my favorite song from the movie though. I always want to get up and dance when I hear it. The dancing sea life reminded me of the movie Fantasia and the carnival scene had me feeling like I was there.

This film is a great summertime family adventure. I seldom like remakes but I was curious to see how this adaptation would play out and I'm so glad I went."
"My Favorite Adaptation YetIt was amazing!! My favorite cartoon adaptation yet. The songs were even bigger and better. Halle Bailey can sing and she really does well as Ariel. I love the backstory with Eric and how it seems more like they were destined to be together vs just instantly falling in love like the cartoon. My only drawback was they still need to do better with the voice/interaction from the animals to actors. But over the years, it's improving. Scale of 1-10 I would give it 8.9. Worth seeing in theaters for sure. And my favorite character from the cartoon was Ursula and Melissa McCarthy did a phenomenal job bringing her to life 😃"
"A beautiful cast, and a gorgeous film.First off, we have amazing talents behind this film. Rob Marshall has proven time and time again he can push out a damn good musical. He continues to bring the magic of theater to the big screen in a fun and captivating way. The fun colors, the visuals, and the costumes. This man had no right to make the movie this stunning.

Lin-Manuel Miranda being the one behind ever revision and added song was genius. Need i remind you all who it was who brought us such amazing musicals like Moana, Encanto, and Hamilton? While I agree it's funny to see his name pop up in the credits anytime. Lin-Manuel is everywhere, and he deserves to be.

You obviously can't forget the talented actresses and singers. Halle Bailey is so talented. Her innocent and childlike wonder makes her the perfect fit to be Ariel. Not to mention she was vocally trained by Beyonce herself along side her equally talented older sister, Chloe. Halle was fit for this role and she blew it out of the water. Don't forget the other amazing talents that have been featured in disney productions and broadway ones alike. Johan Hauer-King as Prince Eric, the legendary Daveed Diggs as flounder, and Awkwafina as Scuttle? Anybody that has a single complaint about this casting is blinded by their fondness of the original."
"This Movie Was EVERYTHINGJust hearing the music as the movie started sparked my childhood memories of the original film. So, they just had to get it right. I saw it in 3D and it was MAGICAL. From beginning to end, I was captivated. This is the best remake I've ever seen. They have really set the bar. I can't wait to go see this again. If I could give it 20 stars, I would.

Halle Bailey was amazing! She was born for this. She's truly a princess. The entire cast was brilliantly selected. I laughed, I cried, I cheered. I even jumped one time. This movie evoked all sorts of emotions. This is truly something to keep in your Disney vault."

I loved it!I love The Little Mermaid. I don't usually like live action remakes but this was gorgeous! The underwater scenes were beautiful. Halle Bailey was perfectly cast for her voice and beauty and she is a good actress. Melissa McCarthy as Ursula was fantastic. I loved the slight change in the story to make Ariel a stronger young woman. I couldn't wait to see this movie and it did not disappoint! I really wish they had shown her transformation dress and wedding gown but that's just me. I really want to see Halle Bailey in more movies. Such a young rising star! The entire cast did a fantastic job and I'm so glad I took my daughter to see this in the theater because it was such a gorgeous undersea experience.
"SERIOUSLY GIVE IT A CHANCEI Grew up with the cartoon version but I honestly love this remake. Everyone thinks it's gonna be bad, you know what was bad? MULAN AND LION KING!! And I'm a huge lion king fan.

This movie gave more depth and character to Eric, a bit more Character to Ariels sisters Melissa McCarthy KILLED IT AS URSULA!! The CGI was beautiful and the movie brought me to tears.

Please, I beg you all to give this movie a chance. I wish they gave Mulan this much respect. If Disney keeps going like this, and not changing much of the story (MULAN) they would have something great. This movie is honestly really good."

"A perfect reimagining of a classicThe film was beautifully made. The orchestral scores are full and lush, the CGI is spectacular, and the cast deliver engaging, well rounded performances. The stand out number for me was poor unfortunate souls - Melissa McCarthy expertly treads the line between comedy, camp and villainous. Halle's voice alone is a wonder, and her performance throughout is nuanced, emotional and thoroughly engaging. Despite Sebastian and flounder receiving a loot of criticism for being too photorealistic to emote, I actually found them the opposite - very cute and characterful. At his movie pays homage to the original with enough new flavour of its own to justify the reimagining. Magical."

"Great movieWhile a tad long for young kids, it was a fabulous remake. CGI was excellent, songs were great (did you expect less with Lin Manuel), casting superb. Agreed with all changes from original movie that were made as they only served to make the movie better and Ariel more well rounded and not a vapid teenager. The main change was the same message that was in the Aladdin remake and I don't remember anyone complaining about that back then. Hailey was phenomenal. My only complaint is the camera technique used in the dancing scene. That may be just my personal preference as I tend not to like that method in any movie and has nothing to do with this remake."

"One of the best live action Disney Films everThe four words that I would describe the movie are hilarious, adventurous, romantic and fun-loving. The plotline was incredible and the cast was spectacular. The sets were glorious. I loved how the story was expanded like giving Eric a backstory for his love for the sea. The costumes were above and beyond. The songs (old and new) were breathtaking. There was also a special cameo. On a scale of 1 to 10 I give this movie 100 because it was so magnificent and magical. I also how there was an easter egg to Hans Christian Anderson in the opening of the film. I loved how Eric and Ariel's relationship starts as friendship and blossoms into love."
"Loved itI grew up with the cartoon. What I particularly liked with the live action was Eric wasn't just a prop. We saw him and Ariel bond and have so much in common and fall in love. The cartoon was perfect don't get me wrong bud it's nice to see a proper love story and Eric wiry a personality.

Halle was amazing. Melissa and Jonah too brilliant job. Great movie. My kids loved it so much they want to go again! My girl loves Ariel's new song while my boy thinks skittles song is hillarious! I loved that Eric has a song too. It's deff a must watch. Romantic colourful and fun. Beautiful music voices and everything fits."
"Disney Finally Got One RightThe Little Mermaid is Disney's first successful attempt of a live action remake since Cinderella. Visually stunning, sounds amazing, and Halle Bailey shines. Melissa McCarthy makes Ursula her own while still honoring the character. And the added personality and backstory given to Eric makes the film a fully fleshed out retelling. I wasn't expecting to like Awkwafina but I found her new song ""The Scuttlebutt"" to be the tune I was singing leaving the theater.

I do miss some of the classic lines like ""...don't underestimate the importance of body language!"" and ""but daddy I love him."" But the film has enough heart on its own to make you allow it some agency."
"The Little Mermaid 2023This film has to be one of the best Disney live actions if not the best. To me everything was done so beautifully that it fully captured the magic of the sea that the original animated film managed to create. The first part, that took part in the ""water"" was absolutely gorgeous and so colourful, maybe the excitement made me ignore all that bad CGI the people keep talking about, but to me it was absolutely perfect even if Flounder was a bit butchered I don't know how it could have been different though.

Halle Bailey was the most perfect Ariel I could ask for, her voice was just so lovely and the way she portrayed Ariel to utmost perfection, as someone whose favourite princess growing up was Ariel I was overjoyed to see how well she handled this role and how close she was to the original character.

Melissa McCarthy was a huge surprise as I haven't seen her in a more serious role, I think she did a wonderful job in bringing Ursula to life, her ""Poor Unfortunate Souls"" moment was also truly amazing and mesmerising.

Oh Jonah Hauer-King, you were absolutely the Eric of my dreams. I loved how much they developed the character and gave him a lovely personality compared to the rather bland animation version. Each scene with Ariel was so adorable and heartwarming I couldn't stop smiling. His voice is unsurprisingly just as lovely as he is.

The pacing was honestly great, not rushed and the extra scenes were an amazing addition that gave the characters more substance, and a way to prove themselves even more. I loved how they handled voiceless Ariel, it was truly lovely and amazing that they chose to try to depict what she was feeling and all her emotions during her stay on land, rather than just leave her silent and pretty looking.

The songs were memorable, even the new ones were beautifully introduced(even if a particular one was a bit ""different"" from the rest I didn't feel like it was so out of place), the new Ariel songs were absolutely lovely and added so much more meaning to her feelings.

To conclude all this, this is truly one of the films that I will continue to love forever. Maybe the magic of the ocean made me oblivious to all of its flaws but I could not be more happy with how this live action turned out!"

"Surprisingly better than the original!Okay so I watched this in theatres first then went home and rewatchrd the original once and it confirmed how I felt in the theatres... This is the first Disney live action remake that I felt was better than the original. The vocals on Halle did it for me and one person in the audience event exclaimed ""wow"" when she hit the high notes. Everyone in the theatre clapped at the end and it was such a great experience seeing it with others that grew up with the cartoon. Supporting cast were also great with a couple songs in there I didn't think I'd enjoy but was pleasantly surprised by.

Don't think this movie should be plagued by culture wars. It's a live action adaptation and it really shouldn't matter what race the main character is when portraying a mythical creature. The person with the best voice got the role and she did an outstanding job. Hope there is a sequel!"
"Best live action adaptationI love and I mean love the original and this movie gives you bits of the original and it's own take that is so beautiful and the new songs are good and emotional. The cgi is not the best in some scenes but the whole movie was so vibrant and beautiful. For the first time has to be one of my favorite songs. Eric and Ariel are too cute I wanted more. Skuttle, Sebastian and flounder are great. And Ursula is so good Melissa added her own flare to it that was perfect. People judged this move for no reason but to pick at her skin color which was no bother to me because Halle Bailey was BORN to play Ariel and my god her voice is AMAZING!!!"
AMAZING!!! Watch it NOW!!I've never been a fan of the Little Mermaid like when I was younger I thought it was a dumb movie and so when I saw that Halle was doing it I was like goddamn it now I have to watch this to support a sister even though I hate the little mermaid. But when I tell you it has really exceeded my expectations I was shocked. Not only did it stay true to the original but it changed some of the major things that I didn't like about the first one. So if you ask me it was a 10/10. There were only a couple things I would probably take off for like Akwafina but even her as Scuttle was a pleasant surprise. Watch it seriously if you like the og you will not be upset and if you didn't you won't be either.
"DISNEY'S BEST LIVE ACTION SO FARThis Movie was Magical since beginning to ending. Halle made such of a beautiful interpretation of Ariel. Jonah IS Prince Eric. Melissa IS Ursula. The animals (Sebastian, Flounder & Scuttle) are one the of big highlights of the movie. Jacob, Daveed and Awkwafina did an amazing job giving their voices to these iconic characters. Flounder was adorable. Scuttle and Sebastian were so funny! The plot stays true to its original movie and I also really enjoyed how they expanded the story of each characters. The original songs had a new taste, but also stays true to the originals. The NEW songs were so beautiful, specially Ariel's. As everyone is talking about, the CGI is not the best but for sure stills enjoyable and magical. It's for sure the best live action Disney has made. It's a Disney Musical, go with a open minded, there's gonna be a lot of beautiful musical moments. ENJOY IT!"
"Absolute stunner!One of the best remakes ever conceived! Watching the movie I just couldn't stop grinning from ear to ear. Halle Bailey shines bright, like literally shimmers and is just... perfect as Ariel. The work and care that the cast and crew put in this film is evident. It's so so good. This version of The Little Mermaid is as close to perfection as you can get. All the feels, especially the final shot of the film... Full on sobbing and applause in the theater as the movie came to a close. Last few things - I just wanna say that when Halle Bailey/Ariel is looking at Prince Eric on the beach and singing about being part of his world you can really feel her determination... and almost desperation? Homegirl said I know what I want and I'm gonna be part of that world! Glad he liked her back...could have been real awkward cause she wasn't going ANYWHERE! Under the Sea is a showstopper, Part of Your World hits you right in the gut (in a beautiful way) and lastly, the Kiss the Girl sequence is one of the most beautiful, tender, yet still funny scenes I have ever seen. Had me giggling and swooning the whole time!"
"MagicI loved it. The Little Mermaid seems to break Disney's trend of soulless live action remakes and breathe some actual life and something actually NEW into its source material. Halle was just radiant, and her singing voice is fit for a siren. I loved her chemistry with Jonah Hauer-King, and revelled in the utter drama of their feelings for one another (the PINING).

The photo-realistic animals could have been perhaps a little less- well, photo-realistic... But overall there was just something so utterly fun about the kaleidoscope of actual, existing sea-creatures so magical-looking that they on numerous occasions took my breath away. I also love the Caribbean setting, and loved Ariel's sisters (named after the seven seas). They stole any scene they were in, and a little more screen time would have been welcome.

Altogether a lovely lovely lovely ride."
"Halle Bailey is a starThe Little Mermaid is one of the best live action Disney movies to date. Halle Bailey's performance as Ariel was utterly amazing. Her singing voice is so angelic and soothing. She really captured the essence of Ariel. Melissa McCarthy as Ursula was great also. The animation was also very vivid and well done. The songs were great and catchy! I remember some of the songs from the original Little Mermaid and was singing right along to them. I admit I had my doubts about the movie at first. However, the movie really exceeded my expectations. My daughter and I really enjoyed it! You won't be disappointed!"
"The Best Movie In A WhileThis movie was by far the best Disney live action remake and in my opinion better than the original. The casting was incredible and Halle Bailey was the PERFECT choice. Everything she did for the role was amazing and made the movie. I loved what they added to the movie, there was more relationship building between Ariel and Eric to really make their love believable and less like Ariel abandoned her family for him. I didn't go in with insane hopes, but it was really the best movie I have seen in a while. They did manage to make the CGI work, and Sebastian's character and line delivery was hilarious. Would 100% recommend."
"AsalI wish that one day we can see the world bigger than stereotypes and look at the beauties.

I just finished this movie and I must say it was really amazing. Everything was so beautiful and Haley Bailey played the role of Ariel perfectly and so did Jonah.

I watched this movie for 2 full hours without any judgment and without wanting to complain, and it was really worth it.

Haley's incredibly beautiful voice and scenes full of love and joy, all gave a good feeling.

Also, the voice of Sebastian, Flounder and Scuttel was very beautiful and full of excitement.

Thank you for recreating this amazing story."
"I honestly danced and cried during this movie...I went in there not expecting anything at all cause let's be honest, some live actions from Disney lately have not been the best. Boy was I surprised! The music was 10/10, the acting 10/10, Melissa looked like she had fun playing her character, Halle was just perfection so much so I wish I saw more of her, the guy that played her dad was just incredible and the prince was great! Honestly I left in tears, and left wanting to watch it again. I honestly don't see how anyone could watch this movie and just simply feel nothing, credit has to go to the production work, how they managed to make under the water look so normal is beyond me."

"It's a MUST SEE!I loved everything about this movie. The singing, the characters, And everything looked so real. I will definitely watch it again. Please go watch this movie for yourself, people hate on greatness, every character in this movie did an incredible good, it's like your watching the original mermaid with a little twist, plus it's real people. Also, when you see Ariel, you seen a beautiful outstanding mermaid with a voice that put a smile or tear on your face when she sung. Lastly, whomever cast the characters did a phenomenal job, because the chemistry that Ariel and the prince had was strong. Love."
"10월 10일Halle Bailey is absolutely great as Ariel. I can definitely feel her whenever she is singing her heart out such as Part of Your World. Not to mention that she is the best part of the film.

Melissa McCarthy did not disappoint at all as Ursula Yeah, she still has that McCarthy behavior from her previous films but she managed to stick with her character and make her great portrayal of the villain.

As for Jonah Hauer King as Prince Eric, he works for the most part in the film. And compared to his animated counterpart, he has more personality by showing his voyager skills and love for adventure also thanks to the addition of having a mother for Eric.

Also, I loved the fact that unlike in the original classic, the film actually fleshed out his character a lot to make the relationship between Ariel and Eric. And while the relationship seemed somewhat hard to accept since it's only three days, at least it was explored more which made me feel for them.

Not gonna lie but Javier Bardem as King Triton makes more sense. While he may seem bland at times, his relationship with his daughter Ariel was expounded a lot more especially by the final act of the film.

As for the new songs, some worked with me like Hauer-King's Wild Uncharted Waters while others I am still warming up to like with Awkwafina and Daveed Diggs rap song The Scuttlebutt. The original songs sung by the cast were all good, no further explanations."

"AmazingI watched this after not seeing the movie in a while and I was very impressed. I loved the songs that were played, I loved how they switched some scenes and the actors and actresses played their roles well. I know there were some backlash on who were chosen for the characters but honestly it wasn't a big deal. As long as the essences of the story is told, it deserves to be shown. I felt chills when the Halle Bailey's rendition of songs were playing. I can't picture anyone at this moment who could have replaced her. A main reason why I love Disney movies is because of the production and I think the directors and choreographers captured it well. Would definitely see again."
"WonderfulThe vibrant and music warmed my heart. Halle gave a wonderful performance from her vocals to her facial expressions when she could not use her voice. Javier was tremendous. I felt every emotion he felt during every scene. I've felt so many emotions from the start to the end of this film. The new songs and minor tweaks and scenes were definitely lovely. I laughed during scuttlebutt, cried during part of your world, and couldn't stop smiling during under the sea. Halle's voice was breathtaking. I felt every bit of emotion, she was feeling as she belted out those songs. This one felt more geared towards her curiosity for adventure, than simply for her yearning to be with a boy. I highly recommend watching."

FANTASTIC MOVIEDefinitely one of the best live action Disney movies they've done. I went into the movie not knowing what to expect and walked out amazed. I grew up with the original and this one managed to bring back the magic the animated one brought. Hallie was amazing and Melissa was an unexpected delight. Sebastian and Scuttle were also an enjoyable comedic pair. The songs were updated just enough to make them feel fresh. I enjoyed the island vibes that ran throughout the movie and the action parts were amazing. I'd watch this one again and again. A feel good/action/romance for all ages. Bravo Disney you knocked it out of the park with this one.

"this movie was surprisingly a lot of fun!In all honesty, I went in thinking I wouldn't enjoy it at all after word of mouth from ""critics"" but was genuinely surprised how fantastic it was! It really stood on its own as a unique adaption the beloved animated original we all love. I love the new Caribbean flare and appreciate they gave Prince Eric more to do since his animated predecessor was flat. Music and songs had my whole theater singing along and Halle nails it as Ariel. She is truly the embodiment of a Disney princess and I see a huge star in the making! Please buy a ticket and watch, you will love it! Best family film of the summer by far and I enjoyed every second of it with the little ones."
"A Breathtaking Underwater Adventure Comes to Life!!!!In a magical blend of captivating storytelling, stunning visuals, and unforgettable performances, the little mermaid enchants audiences of all ages! This modern retelling of the timeless tale, directed by a visionary team and brought to life by an immensely talented cast, immerses viewers in a wondrous underwater world that will leave them spellbound.

From the opening scene, it is clear that no expense was spared in creating the mesmerizing world beneath the waves. The vibrant and meticulously crafted underwater sets, enhanced by seamless CGI, transport us to an enchanting realm filled with majestic sea creatures, colorful coral reefs, and sparkling treasures. The attention to detail is impeccable, making every frame a visual feast for the eyes.

Halle Bailey's portrayal of Ariel is simply breathtaking. Her voice captures the essence of the beloved character, while her radiant presence on screen brings a refreshing energy and authenticity to the role. Bailey's performance is beautifully complemented by an exceptional supporting cast. Melissa McCarthy brings a delightful blend of humor and heart as Ursula, and Javier Bardem's commanding presence as King Triton is truly regal. The chemistry among the cast members is palpable, adding depth and emotion to the story.

The film's soundtrack is a magical celebration of Alan Menken's iconic compositions. The new arrangements of beloved songs, combined with enchanting new melodies, breathe new life into the classic musical numbers. The blend of powerful vocals, captivating choreography, and breathtaking cinematography creates moments of pure cinematic magic that will make your heart soar.

One of the film's greatest strengths lies in its reimagined narrative. While staying true to the heart and soul of the original story, the script introduces compelling twists and turns that add depth to the characters and make the tale resonate with contemporary audiences. It explores themes of self-discovery, the power of love, and the importance of finding one's own voice, delivering a powerful and empowering message.

It really surpasses expectations. It transports viewers on an unforgettable journey under the sea, where they can revel in the wonders of imagination and rediscover the magic of a beloved story. And is a testament to the enduring power of fairy tales, and it will leave you filled with joy, wonder, and a renewed belief in the transformative power of dreams."
"A Mix of the BestThe Little Mermaid was a mix of the original, broadway shows, and a reimanaging . The movie kept most of the original story and added more to some of it. It added more backstory to some of the characters and music for the reimagining that fit. The updated original songs were good. Some sounded better than others. The acting was really good. The visual effects were pretty good. They looked better than I thought it would. The production team kept a good balance and it felt like they tried to reach both the old audience and a new one. The family and I enjoyed it even though it was a little too long. Would recommend to those who are fan of the original, the Broadway shows and like to be surprised by new additions that fit the world we live in today. Enjoyed the cameo too."
"CaptivatingPersonally loved the movie it's visually amazing and the CGI is entrancing. To not see the movie would be a mistake as it is beautifully and carefully written. Halle is beautiful and her singing is captivating she is the perfect Ariel and her tale is ever little girls dream. Not to mention the movie is hilarious I was laughing throughout Sebastian and Scuttle bringing laughter to the theatre. As well as the unexpected humour of Ursula she really has a dark sense of humour which was unexpected but warranted.

Vanessa was also a dark and beautiful character Jessica was the perfect casting and brought a mysterious allure to Ursula. I also can't forget about Prince Eric he just grows more and more on you during the film their chemistry was indescribable and adorable the kids loved it.

There is always room for improvement like the sisters were a bit unnecessary, eg the changing of their names etc ,but that should not be a deterrent neither should clips taken out of context online like outfits if you watch the movie you realise how adorable the hat and the shoe moments are. Overall, I think the movie was perfect and definitely think you should watch it."
"I loved it.Halle Bailey voice is beautiful and She did an phenomenal job playing Ariel. I don't think they could have picked a better actor to play Ariel. I do wish that flounder and sebastian were drawn better, but I also know they were trying to make them as realistic as possible. The movie is beautiful and sticks close to the original story. They also added a few more background details about the characters, which would make for an interesting prequel. (*HINT *HINT). The cast did an amazing job, I loved every minute of it. This is easily one of Disney's top 3 live action remakes and definitely deserves a watch."

"Nostalgic!The movie was cute, funny, and a tear jerker at the right moments. Even my husband admitted to a tear or two.

Halle is really captivating when she sings, MY GOODNESS. Melissa McCarthy did really well as well.

You could really feel the love story that was being portrayed. It didn't feel rushed either. There was never a full moment. We went and saw the movie at 8:30pm, and even the kids stayed up!

Watching the live-action brought out the kid in me and my heart was filled with joy.

The movie was also very colorful.

Despite the negative reviews and comments, the movie is really good and entertaining.

I enjoyed singing along and also the new changes. I would definitely see it again!"
"The renaissance of Disney's live actionsThe Little Mermaid is Disney's newest live-action that hits theaters. Directed by Rob Marshall (Chicago) and musicalized by the original composer, Alan Menken, in partnership with Lin-Manuel Miranda, the film deepens the history of animation and brings welcome new elements.

Disney nailed it by casting Halle Bailey in the role of the dreamy mermaid Ariel, who always wanted to know more about the human world, even under the watchful eye of the dreaded King Triton (Javier Bardem). Ariel makes a pact with the sea witch Ursula (Melissa McCarthy), to exchange her voice (very beautiful, by the way) for human legs and venture to the surface in search of her love, Prince Eric (Jonah Hauer-King). In fact, Hauer and Bailey exhale a delicious chemistry to watch in the discovery of love.

Halle brings great delicacy, strength and honesty to the mermaid in her first major role in theaters and is very comfortable as the princess. However, at times when more emotion is required to the part, she holds it back a little. Melissa's Ursula had the mission of balancing caricature with villainy in the role of one of Disney's most iconic characters and, despite having held a little in the evil department, she gives herself body and soul to the character.

But those who really steal the scene are: Sebastian (Daveed Diggs), as the faithful crab and butler of King Triton, and Scuttle (Awkwafina), as the great connoisseur of human trinkets. The dynamic of the duo deserves to be highlighted as an excellent comic relief.

The underwater sequences are remarkable, because Marshall managed to create a colorful, living world and, in contrast to the widespread fear, quite illuminated. However, the excessive use of CGI, at times, is visibly noticeable, but does not hinder the final experience of the film.

Packed by the classic songs of the animation (minus ""Les Poissons"" and ""Daughters of Triton"", unfelt absences), and updated lyrics to ""Poor Unfortunate Souls"" and ""Kiss the Girl"", the composers choose to include 3 new songs written for the film, aiming at a possible Oscar nomination. While ""Wild Uncharted Waters"" and ""For the First Time"" bring that Lin-Manuel broadway magic to scene and were a logical choice to be included on the movie, ""The Scuttlebutt"" lacks the magic of the previous and it's easily forgotten by the gown-ups, though children might like it.

The Little Mermaid thrives on magnifying the history of the classic animation and brings a freshness to the new generation to be enchanted by the character, and, why not, for the old generation to be re-enchanted as well."
"Best live action Disney has put out! Halle is incredible!I couldn't stop watching, the story was told better than the og. I will be watching multiple times! Halle Bailey was born for this role, from her voice to her smile. Jonah as prince Eric was very compelling and I believed their love story. I could help but root for them hard threw out the film. Melissa was freaking incredible! From the laughs to the little quirks. Flounder was adorable, Sebastian super enthusiastic and funny! I couldn't help but laugh multiple times with the bird just really good comedic timing. I wished they had more content with the Ariel's sisters, I was left wanting more of them and their lore. Overall a great experience and I will be watching again."
MagicalThe music was the best part such a beautiful voice from Ariel! I also loved the small changes of consent to the classic songs because they were perfectly transitioned and didn't take away from original. Ursula was also amazing also the flounder. This live action came to its own is the best way though honestly some cgi could have been better. I was transported back to watching the classic on vcr as soon as the movie started. All in all a beautiful live action with a siren with the most amazing and angelic voice and the nostalgia was hitting!! Don't hesitate go with an open mind and relieve your childhood!
"Absolutely loved it my 3 year old sister wants to watch it againAs a white girl who grew up only having the original little mermaid on a cassette tape on repeat, I was originally against it especially when I heard that it would be changed. I absolutely love the live action just as much as the original. My favorite Disney live action adaptation so far. Halle did such an amazing job. I doubted her acting skills at first because I never saw her act before but she is a perfect Ariel. The movie is phenomenal. My whole family went to see it. My 3 and 6 year old sisters are more then impressed. They adore Halle as Ariel. I love this version just as much as the original one. Going to watch it multiple times."
"Best live action adaptationThe original was a masterpiece in its own right, but the live action takes it just a little further while keeping it grounded. The cast of characters were more rounded out, and the lore helped establish and guide the story.

I was pleasantly surprised with the Part of That World sequences, because those are obviously major standouts of the original. The look of the movie was spot on from the cinematography, character designs, and settings.

Halle Bailey embodied Ariel flawlessly. She has the vocals, but her beauty and mannerisms transformed her into the little mermaid.

Some other standout scenes from this adaptation are the Under the Sea number, the library scene, and the epilogue was a very sweet way to wrap up things with all the characters."

"A wonderful reimaginingI loved this film! I felt the actors did a wonderful job in the main cast and of course, Halle and Melissa stole the show. I thought the underwater visuals were stunning and seeing all the undersea life was so cool. Eric and Ariel have better relationship this time around because Eric has more substance and we don't just get a montage of them doing stuff together. I was happy with the lore additions and just wish we could have gotten some time spent fleshing them out more. If you expect this to be the animated film, it's not. It may have some elements and similarities, but I feel like it is a wonderful story that coexists nicely with Disney's cartoon. I was able to get things I was lacking from the animated film and discover cooler ways to show off some scenes that improved them."

"Unique by its own rights.I have just watched this film with my partner and my 7-year-old stepdaughter. Based on their reaction to the film, their analysis after watching it and my personal feelings towards it, The Little Mermaid stands unique.

The film has beautiful music, stunning graphics under the sea and a very consistent plot (better than the animated film).

The Little Mermaid manages to develop each character in a way that by the end of the film you root for all of them.

Ursula was absolutely superb as the antagonist, the chemistry between Sebastian, Flounder and Scuttle was both entertaining and relatable. Javier Bardem is exactly the actor for that role.

What truly makes me score this film a 9 is how my family has been talking about it for the last two hours. It is a family film and it is a unique film in its own right."
"A great different little mermaidThis is a very honest review. This movie is good. Not excellent, but people still think its bad because they compare it with the original animated film. I think the director Rob Marshall created this film without thinking about the original animated classic idea. He created his new version of the little mermaid. In my opinion, if you don't think of the original animated version people wouldn't hate so much on this live-action. The director didn't focus on the animated. He wanted to create something different for this generation. The movie is decent, elegant and it has the songs we all love. It would have been a lot better to see more love and feeling on the soundtrack. I have to admit that the soundtrack of the animated is way better than the live-action. Even, the soundtrack of the live-action of Aladdin is better. I wanted more. I was expecting more from the songs, even though the director kept them all, but it felt like they needed more sentimental feelings like, for example in the beginning and in the finale. It needed more emotion. I'm still happy with the result though. We have to capture the directions mind. He wanted to created this live-action very real, like it existed in real life, that's why they created flounder and Sebastian like real animals without any face emotions. Anyhow, I don't want to be so negative. The film was beautiful. Halle was really Ariel, she was my favorite of the whole cast. She did beyond amazing, powerful voice, good acting as Ariel, Eric and King Triton were really good, and Úrsula was ok but could have been a lot better, she needed to express more face expressions like the animated. But overall the movie was decent and watchable. It's my second favorite live-action."
"Actual Chemistry!!!This is the first remake I prefer to the original, and the cartoon was 🔥!!! Halle Bailey sounds like she's the winner of a Jodi Benson impersonation contest...it's actually uncanny. And Eric was expanded upon in a good and wonderful way, that adds a lot to their chemistry. 1 scene between the 2 of them will be in my memory forever...so hot. McCarthy was a boss in it too. What got me was my favorite song lyric was changed, but, I actually like it better!!! Even the crab won me over, along with zany Scuttle! Their rap was kinda lame, but short enough to not upset anyone. Flounder looked appropriately like a fish. Some of the visuals in Under the Sea weren't as good as the cartoon but it'd be hard to go silly with realistic fishies. Halle Bailey makes up for it though being gorgeous, and cute, and pelvic thrusting through the waters...mm!"
"Fresh lyrics to bring a Disney Classic into the new age!I loved it - plot holes fixed, new songs and lyrics to breathe fresh life into the musical, and a great cast to bring the world of The Little Mermaid to life. From small changes to big, each has been carefully crafted to keep the spirit of the original while making some much needed changes to create an overall better plot and more nuanced adventure for a fan favourite. As a long time fan, the Disney OG is precious to me, but I felt this addition to an already established collection of Mermaid Tails (pun very much intended) was well worth the 4 year wait it took to get here. The aesthetics were brilliant, the songs truly sing-along worthy and overall a joyful film to see."
"Hailee is amazing!Ariel is my least favorite Disney Princess, but my teenage daughters wanted to see this. I was actually surprised with how good it was. Hailee was the perfect choice for Ariel. Her voice is so amazing and ppl were clapping every time she would sing lol. The entire cast was perfect picked. Melissa McCarthy was hilarious, as usual. She will make me laugh in a zombie apocalypse I'm sure of it lol. Daveed, Awkwafina, and Jacob were also great as Sebastian, Scuddle, and Flounder. Javier Bordem killed as King Triton and all the supporting cast members were just as amazing. Two thumbs up Disney!!!!!!"
"i thought it would be worseInitially, i must admit, the movie was somewhat underwhelming, lacking excitement. However, as the plot unfolded and the mesmerizing music filled the air, it gradually drew me in, igniting my interest in the film. Admittedly, i questioned the necessity of a lengthy two-hour duration, yet the awe-inspiring special effects compensated for any reservations. When news broke that Ariel's ethnicity would be altered, a wave of criticism ensued, fostering negative expectations for the movie. Yet, much to my surprise, the outcome was quite the opposite. Undeniably, the movie's enchantment is most potent during the inaugural viewing, thus i recommend savoring it just once, ideally in the company of like-minded individuals."
"Fantastic Movie and Definitely Worth A Watch!!!Halle Bailey is such a beautiful and talented actress! She definitely spiced things up compared to that played out boring original Mermaid. I'm in love with the remake. Disney definitely didn't disappoint. The cast was amazing.

I look forward to seeing all the new remakes. It's definitely worth your money to go and watch. Despite all the other negative reviews from people who haven't seen it, that are posting just to be hateful. Don't let that deter you from missing out on such a wonderful movie. It's a movie the whole family will enjoy and will leave you breathless. The animation looked amazing. I'm in love!"
"The original Little Mermaid isn't one of my favorites from Disney, but this movie was goodAs someone who holds no great love for the original Little Mermaid of 1989, this version was actually pretty great!

The movie was a little on the long side but very fun and cute! Had more action scenes than I expected going into it, and of course, the music was great! I'd gone in expecting spectacular vocal performances, and I wasn't let down. Having listened to the soundtrack before watching the movie, I was a bit disappointed by a couple of the new songs, but they worked surprisingly well in the film!

Halle Bailey is an adorable Ariel, and I really enjoyed Melissa McCarthy & Jonah Hauer-King as Ursula and Eric. Definitely top two of the Disney live-action remakes!"

"Haven't been to the theaters in over ten years- this was the movie to bring me backI'll preface by stating that I'm autistic, and I've seen cartoon version dozens and dozens of times, to the point that for the first 20 minutes- I could spot each and every difference, each and every minutiae. It didn't mean I wasn't captivated or enthralled, but I still haven't watched more than the first 30 minutes of the Aladdin live action remake, because it was like so many terrible remakes before it: unimaginative and a horrible, trampling feeling upon the memories of my childhood. In under twenty minutes of watching this movie- it was so clear how this movie was passing such a wonderful homage to the original and yet it was going to stand on its own. This live action version isn't some terrible remake, it's a heartfelt reimagining, in which the viewer in so engrossed with the incredible imagery of this underwater life, you no longer care about what differences there are with the cartoon or live action. You care about where this story is taking you, forgetting you're in a theater, you're just along for this wonderful, magical ride. Forget the malarkey you've heard or seen from the trailers, this is a wonderful movie for people of all ages! My septuagenarian mother loved it as much as I did, or all the kids in the theater. Everyone clapped at the end, it was such an AMAZING experience, to the point that I'm thoroughly convinced mermaids are real, and in love with how well the story was told! PHENOMENAL movie, it's made me want to go back and see it again, but also to go back to movie theaters in general!!!"
"Best Disney Remake!This movie is hands down Disney's best live action remake. The movie was visually stunning, the acting was spot on, the characters were likable, and the music was beyond expectations. Halle was exactly what this movie needed to give it a fresh spin on a Disney classic. Her voice and acting was superb. I had doubts about Melissa McCarthy as Ursula, but wow did she kill it! Ursula is one of my favorite villains and Melissa's version made this villain one of the best. Sebastian and Scuttle stole the show. They were hilarious and paired well in the film. I'm already looking forward to seeing this movie again!"

"So captivating...halle as ariel is perfect...best live action so farThis movie has to be the best live action to date halle bailey is perfection as she embodies ariel, her innocence, her curiosity and her passion to a tee...halle clearly put her heart and soul in this role and was absolutely amazing plis her voice can not be denied...Sebastián and scuttle are hilarious and the music and ariels voice is to die for...it will have u smiling the whole time. Melissa as ursula was shocking as she did such a good job....of course it's not perfect there could have been more sea creatures and mer people throughout the movie but that's me just being picky...the cgi and effects are much better than in the preview trailers that people will be pleasantly surprised. Wish the sisters had more screen time as well...overall the story keeps the heart of the 1989 version while cleaning up some unanswered questions and giving the us a deeper looks into some of our favorite characters....people of all ages can enjoy this movie and it will have u humming the songs for the rest of the day after leaving the theater...bring some tissues as its so gorgeous u may shed a tear...dianey did a great job with this one."
Amazing!Everything I expected and more. My daughter loved it. She loves the representation and we get a chance to watch the original and love it even more! I understand why some people may be apprehensive about the movie but give it a chance. There's nothing but hatefulness in the world. The movie was really good and I think we'll be going to see it for a second time. This time I'm bringing my niece and God daughter! I know they are gonna love it just as much as my daughter did. I think I was more giddy to watch this movie than my daughter lol. Halle was amazing and looked beautiful. Loved Ursula and can't wait to see it again!
"Would DEFINITELY Recommend!I was a huge fan of the cartoon as a kid, as well as Hans Christian Andersens story.

I felt like this movie hands down did both justice.

It not only told the story, in some parts almost shot for shot like the cartoon, but it also expanded on the story.

They provided extra songs to give us more time to relate to and fall in love with Ariel.

They gave all the main characters extra layers for this movie. Prince Eric, Ursula, Triton, etc... The ONLY drawback I found in the theater was Ursula's design. It was distracting. Even with Melissa McCarthy trying her best... the terrible Look and design distracted from the great performance.

Aside from that everyone was amazing in their roles. The singing was superb.

They chose the BEST actress for Ariel. She nailed every song and brought people in the theaters jaws to drop.

Would definitely recommend!"
"HALLE BAILEY IS BEAUTIFULLY TALENTEDThis movie surpassed all of my expectations. I knew it was going to be good but wow they really blew it out of the water. Halle is amazing (as expected) she really encapsulated everything Ariel is. Every time she opened her mouth to sing I was fighting back tears, she's just that talented. A true siren voice. And Jonah was such a perfect prince, his song in the movie was so good and so emotional I loved it. Him literally begging her to find him again in a song. And the way it showed just how perfect they truly are for each other (not going to spoil but they are so similar in two different worlds, true soulmates). The visuals were wonderful and so bright underwater, I'm still fascinated by all of it. Also I cannot get over the dance choreography in Under The Sea, phenomenal. Scuttle, Sebastian, and Flounder were the perfect little sidekicks and Sebastian had me laughing out loud. Will definitely be going back again to watch. This is cinema!"
"HALLE BAILEY IS A STAR!Best live action remake ever. This movie was fantastic. Halle as Ariel was absolutely perfect. Melissa as Ursula was a standout, Sebastian, Floundrr, and Scuttle were all great. Eric and His mom were so good. Triton was great. The visuals were near perfect, there was only a few times where the visuals were subpar but not many. Color wise great! The costumes were perfect, Colleen Atwood is a visionary. Sets were absolutely stunning, Eric's castle omg so pretty. The new songs, For the first time: I absolutely loved it sounded just like a Broadway song and it was perfect, Scuttlebutt: not my favorite but not that bad, Wild Uncharted Waters: great song. Ovarall incredible movie! Highly Recommend."
"I loved itThe movie was brilliantly done! I think the acting was incredible for everyone involved, and Halle and Jonah's chemistry was *chefs kiss*. For a live action under water movie, they did quite well with the feeling of it being underwater without filming underwater. I was a little disappointed by how much they toned down flounder though, in terms of colour and size. 3D was a very good experience but I might go see it again without bc I want to watch it again lol. Honestly, this movie was amazing and genuinely so enjoyable to watch. The 2hrs flew by and left me wanting a sequel. I hope Halle and Jonah are cast in another movie opposite each other bc their chemistry was palpable. She was truly meant to be Ariel and he was meant to be Eric. Might be my new favourite Disney movie."
"Enjoyable from start to finishThe music, acting, visuals, everything was truly astounding. Disney did everything right with this remake and honestly everyone here saying otherwise is full of it (probably jaded by sitting on the disney hate bandwagon) Halle was amazing, the couple were adorable together, javier bardem adds a depth and tone to triton that humanizes the character more. Instead of this authoritarian angry shouting hypermacho king from the original we get a worried father who truly just feels he wants to keep his daughter safe and happy. I will defend javiers triton until I'm blue in the face.

Melissa mccarthy absolutely owns the role of Ursula and just steals every scene she is in. Even the actress playing the disguised Ursula is a complete delight in the few scenes she is needed in. Hilarious yet intimidating when need be. Even her eels come off as more intimidating.

This movie is the benchmark we need for any future disney remakes. Don't let all the naysayers and disney haters scare you away. Watch the movie and enjoy."

"Great movieSaw this opening night! Haven't been to a movie since before covid hit. I can't think of a better movie to see! This movie was cast perfectly! Halle is incredible as Ariel and Melissa as Ursula was simply awesome! Jonah as Prince Eric was great! Everyone should see this movie! When Ariel sings ""Part Of Your World"" I teared up! I also love that Jodi Benson makes an appearance in this movie! There were a few scenes I felt could have been shorter but I like the additional songs that were added to the movie! I will definitely be getting the DVD and will watch it on Disney+ when it comes on! The people who are rating this so low are only mad because of the casting!"
"Romantic, Adventurous and Pleasingly authentic to the spirit of the original.I wasnt sure about a two hour movie, but in retrospect, thats only 45 minutes over the original. The time flew by in large part because a superb cast handled the material they were given with aplomb. Melissa McCarthy's Ursula was amusing and devious and the scene where she re-transforms on the balcony is terrifying. Great CGI there; otherwise, there were a lot of bland underwater scenes excepting some special moments like 'Under the Sea' and the battle scene.

Eric was fleshed out and his longing for exploration made us see why Ariel fell for him. It was a nice touch to have him risking his life to save his dog because Ariel had done the same for Flounder the previous day. Again, it shows why she feels a sense of kinship if not infatuation.

I felt neutral regarding the rest of the supporting cast and wish Triton's daughters of the seven seas had been played up more (what powers they have, etc). I did love Sebastian's little quips though, enough that I was able to get over how weird a humanesque crab looks.

Closing remarks belong to Halle Bailey. She was a siren. And I missed her when she wasnt in a scene. Her angelic voice has power and anguish behind it that the original Ariel didnt have. As other have mentioned, her face naturally has this childlike expressiveness and her eyes were always mischievous or sweet. As Ariel she was innocent, fierce, and lovely. Throughout the movie we hear her iconic siren song (the one ursula traps into her necklace) again and again but it was most haunting when Ursula used it to trick Eric into thinking she was ""his savior."" The sounds Miss Bailey made when he went searching for that voice through the fog...ohmygoodness. I wouldve flung myself into the sea had I been a seaman; as it was, I was as transfixed as Eric and physically moved forward in my seat so I could be closer to it. I get why she was cast now. Glad I took a chance on this movie."

"Better Than I ExpectedI'm shocked to see the complaints. There were a few changes I really liked, for example how the mermaids represented different parts of the world. Everyone can be a mermaid! The movie taking place on a diverse island was nice too. I feel like it makes sense given that the fish population showed this was likely a tropical place. The animal characters could have been more cutesy and the film seemed dark and blueish even when on land, but the songs were all great. The Scuttlebutt song made me laugh. Melissa McCarthy as Ursula was phenomenal. She did such an amazing job!! I wish Eric was played by Zac Efron but he's my crush and too old I guess. In both versions I really wish she wasn't 16 and maybe 22ish.... and I really wonder what girl would give up being a mermaid. I think the dream would be to live as a mermaid but that's me. Two hours is kind of long for the littles but overall I really enjoyed this movie and so did my young kids. I went in with no expectations and I thought the movie was really good. I would definitely see it again."

"Thank you Disney and Halle Bailey!This movie was everything I wanted to see from Disney! The music, art, and performances were on point! I loved being able to escape everything and want to be a part of that world. If you haven't watched it, please go watch it! It was so great it warmed my heart to see my cousin I took jump out of her seat and enjoy the movie so much! Thank you! Wished I had this when I was a kid, so I could see this kind of representation. I have been playing this music non stop on my way to work everyday when I'm feeling down and it always puts a smile on my face. I've gotten many co workers to check it out because of how great it was and they loved it!"
"So good I had to see it again!I really loved this remake and I'm sure it'll become a new classic for current and future generations! Not only is it breathtakingly beautiful and colorful, all of the actors/actresses were stellar and flowed effortlessly with one another. The songs were perfect! From Sebastian's jokes, to Ariel's voice, Ursula's acting, and even Scuttle's rapping... everyone did wonderful. Overall, the movie was just a lot of fun and magic!!! I saw it on Saturday and went back to see it on Monday on 3D.

Remakes of stories that hundreds of years old are what help keeps these stories alive for another hundred years."
"Disney's Best Live Action SO FARThis movie is absolutely EVERYTHING. Starting with its perfect casting. There is no one better to be Ariel. Halle delivered a fantastic performance and the vocals... oh my god! If you are familiar with the animation version, you know how important the vocals and that Ariel innocence are. Halle is perfect.

The movie is super colourful and the visuals are insane. The CGI was an excellent surprise. Rob Marshall understood the assignment and brought the magic of the animation version and added a lot more for those who were expecting a surprise. I have said it, and will say it again: the movie is an excellent combination of VIBRANT COLORS, SOUL AND CHARISMA.

Perfection."
"It's long but amazing!Disney this is the first live action film that I took my family to see in theaters. My first question ..... So I'm not sure if Disney created this live action for adults to relive their youth because at 150 min it's long vs 83 min? The original . However that is not to take away from the cast performance they all did amazing job and I personally enjoyed every moment including the music and costumes ect. I say you have to go experience in theater for yourself, as your kids will enjoy it and unless they have short screen time at home..... which I doubt...they will enjoy this family friendly and amazing movie!"
"I really enjoyed every bit of this remake .Halle did a great jobEverything from the comedy ,to the songs to the storyline was great .I loved that they played around with new actors and gave us a new perspective of things . GREAT MOVIE OVERALL. Also enjoyed the hair the new Ariel had the flow it had .This is a film I would watch again and again with no hesitation at all .Every performer outdid themselves and made sure they gave the best of the character and just outright gave us something to remember .The stayed true to the storyline and also gave us a sneak peek of Eric who was barely given any character in the original. So that's a plus in the directors side."

"It's great!People should go to the movies without expectations and enjoy things for what they are. There's no need to compare this film with the animated classic.

This movie is great, vocals are on point, it's as realistic as it can be without losing the ""Disney fantasy"" factor.

Children and adults were singing and reacting all the time at the cinema, even men with their girlfriends/wives. The whole ""Kiss the girl"" scene is pure magic and ""Under the sea"" makes you want to be inside the screen, dancing and singing with all the characters.

The new songs and changes totally work. The plot is cohesive. Seriously, go and watch it!"
"Beautiful!Halle Bailey is incredible as Ariel. Perfectly cast! Her voice is so unbelievably beautiful, like she is an actual siren.

The movie is much more colourful and brighter than it seems like in the trailer. Especially Under the Sea shows this.

Sebastian and Scuttle provided most of the funny lines and did so amazingly.

Melissa was very fun & scary as Ursula. Her human version was so good I wish there was more of her!

I love that they added more to Eric and made him similar to Ariel. This is without a doubt 1 of the best Disney live actions! Not an exact copy and paste of the original, they really made it their own."
The most solid remake since jungle bookHalle Bailey was wonderful. Changed just enough to make it interesting. Eric's song was the worst new addition. The actor was fine but they could've found a better voice. Disney didn't have a problem doing it with hsm. The CGI on giant Ursula was awful. She just looked like a storm cloud blob. Loved Melisa McCartney as Ursula though. Poor unfortunate souls was great. The under the sea number was also surprisingly enjoyable. I've disliked every remake since jungle book. So I expected to only enjoy Halle Bailey but liked the whole movie. Halle's singing was impeccable. I wish all the sisters had sung together tho.

"Amazing!I enjoyed it so much, so did my husband and 6 year old daughter. Halle was absolutely fantastic as Ariel!!! She embodied Ariel's innocence, curiosity and charm but also added greater passion and longing. Her chemistry with Jonah was lovely to watch and I was pleased to see that Jonah's character had been explored much more. The entire cast surpassed my expectations. Melissa was wonderful as Ursula, I wasn't sure if she was a good fit but she was great. Javier was perfect as Triton. I personally loved the visuals both underwater and on land. This is the best Disney live action so far in my opinion. It was a breath of fresh air to have a princess who could actually sing her heart out in such an emotive way! Just brilliant."
Amazing!!!!10 out of 10 recommend! Such a great movie! My 13 daughter and I went to a 10:30 show and we have the theater to ourselves! The performances were excellent! Just a great production!! The music was so good! This took me back to childhood and this is brings the original to life. I appreciate the diversity and inclusiveness. Ariel (Hailey)is simple gorgeous and really executed this role. I think this is one of the best movies this year. I am so glad that i made the decision to come see it! Definitely a memorable experience that I am so grateful to have shared with my daughter. Excellent! Love it!
"Halle Bailey was a stellar ArielI went into this remake as a skeptic. I have utter distain for this remakes with the exception of The Jungle Book. I came out wanting to see to this one again. Halle Bailey was exceptional. She acted and sang wonderfully. Melissa McCarthy was great as Ursula. She had large shoes to fill. I enjoyed Eric and the story between him and Ariel. Their relationship was more fleshed out than in the animated film. The new songs were fine, but Ariel's inner monologue was a standout.

For the minus, the look could have been better. The CGI in the water was spotty at best. In the visual, the animated version is the winner hands down.

I felt this remake stands on its own and brought something to the table."
"Beautiful movie, perfect ArielI was blown away by Halle, she was so perfect for this role. Her voice is absolutely amazing and angelic. This was such an awesome film to enjoy with little ones and is now easily one of our family favorites that we will watch over and over again. Disney couldn't have picked a more perfect princess!!! I can see Halle doing incredible things following this masterpiece, i cant wait to see more of her on the big screen. This movie definitely brought the magic and nostalgia, we laughed and sing during the whole film. It was beautifully done and i cant wait to see it again. I've been waiting so long to see this and was not disappointed at all. 10/10 for me!!!"
"Far better than I excited - 9/10!I laughed. I cried. I smiled. This might've been the best live action remake that Disney has released yet. I really want to see it again - like today.

The nostalgia, the songs and the characters remain the core of this movie. But the creative team also introduced new plot twists to make the movie refreshing, as if I was hearing this story for the very first time. Halle, Jonah, Daveed and Melissa gave amazing performances.

If I could change one thing about the movie, I'd give Halle another ballad that isn't written by Lin Manuel Miranda. Her songs are front-loaded so there's a bit of a lull during the second half of the movie that could be filled by another show-stopping song.

The movie isn't perfect (but what movie is), but I applaud all of those who worked on this film because it is a beautiful work of art."
A must SeaThis Disney live action blows all the other live reinterpretations out of the water. The soundtrack is both music from the 1989 film and original music was fresh and fun and catchy. I did have to warm up to the Scuttle song. Lin-Manuel's song writing and music production has a very unique style that is almost too recognizable at times to the point where I will be completely taken out of the moment because I can tell he is behind it. His style was only vastly present in the song Awkwafina as Scuttle sings/raps. Movie is engaging from beginning to end without a dull moment. A lot of the dialogue from the classic was kept which was a nice touch. This is the movie of the summer and I will be watching it again!
"Perfect live actionThis movie is perfection. Halle was the perfect Ariel, It was clear why she was chosen. Wasn't a big fan of Eric's song but overall It was a great movie. LOVEd the sisters. Wish we could have seen more of them. The dynamic between Ariel & Triton was beautiful. Flounder was adorable. He is my favorite sidekick. Scuttle was just ok. Didn't make or break the movie, but the song was out of place. This movie was visually stunning. I want to go back and see It in 3D. The Queen was actually my favorite. She was an overprotective mom and It was clear she loved her son. The family dynamics were so amazing g."
"Better than what I was expectingThe original animation will always hold a special place in my heart, and no other adaptation can erase that. However, in this live-action version, there are certain aspects that truly captivate me, such as Halle's voice and the singing scenes. Especially, 'Under the Sea' I really enjoy and have fun watching the scene. The scene also reminds me of the lively and colorful scenes like 'Be Our Guest' in Beauty and the Beast and 'I Just Can't Wait to Be King' in The Lion King. The parade of characters and the fun vibe in the scene bring back fond memories. Another favorite song of mine is 'Part of Your World,' I was so emotional with it. Halle did an exceptional job delivering this song. The final song, 'Kiss the Girl,' though I wasn't really focusing on Eric and Ariel, it was made incredibly cute and funny by Sebastian, Scuttle, and Flounder stealing the spotlight.

Although there's not much adaption for the storyline. The storyline remains the same just like the animation, so I wasn't quite thrilled about this and felt that it's boring (an unconditional love story of the prince and the mermaid that happened in 3 days)

The movie's effects were impressive, successfully portraying both the vibrant and dark aspects of the ocean. Nevertheless, there were some awkward moments when the mermaids appeared on screen. Sebastian and Scuttle, on the other hand turns out to be way better than what I was expecting. They were portrayed well, with their characters and movements bringing great enjoyment. Unfortunately, Flounder was a bit of a letdown, as his dialogue was scarce and unimportant. Moreover, the attempt at a realistic fish-like appearance made me somewhat uncomfortable (well Sebastian in the animation version is quite creepy looking, so it's Flounder turn I guess)"

"It made it to my favourite movie everGrowing up, princess Ariel was my whole life and I had big expectation for this movie but it surpassed it all the way! I cried and had chills during the whole movie! Way better than the original and I could've not imagine a better actress than halle! The live action deepens the whole story and all of its characters, especially prince Eric. They added realistic, perfect scenes that made the whole story way deeper and better and deepened Ariel and Eric's relationship. The humour's also perfect. I love Sebastian and it has been adapted perfectly to the 21st century while respecting perfectly the original movie! Will see it again a second time in theatres, and I never saw a movie twice in theatres!

Like Jodie Benson, the original voice of Ariel, said: the live-action goes more ""in depth"" with characters and ""expands"" the story in ways the original didn't allow."

"Beautifully made, exciting, and sweetSuch a great movie! There were a few changes, but honestly they made so much sense. It was magical and beautiful. Halle Bailey was sweet, and innocent, and has an incredible voice. Triton and Ursula were absolutely perfect. The visuals were stunning and my seven year old was in awe. Scuttle being a girl made so much sense. She was flighty, ditsy, sassy and so funny. I was worried about Flounder but even he was good! Eric was handsome and likable, and had more depth as a character than we saw in the animated film. Loved his song too! I loved seeing Triton's daughters looking like the areas in which they were from. The seas they represent. No complaints. None. It was great. We loved it and will go see it again!"
"My heart is extremely happyEver since I was little, the little mermaid was and is one of my favourite Disney princess movies. I was without a doubt extremely excited after I heard about the news of it becoming a live action movie! I went to the cinema with my auntie and I was left speechless and in tears at how beautifully and well written this movie was. The order on how Ariel and Eric met to the point they get married feels much more natural and sweet/romantic than the original animation did it.

Yes, Halle Bailey does not have the original 'bright red' hair I always recognised Ariel for, but Halle looked absolutely stunning in this movie. The outfits she wore, the stunning coloured mermaid tail, the stunning hairstyle and colour... Yes, to me she really felt like Ariel.

I can not express how Halle Bailey's voice made me feel. All I can truly say is how stunning she sang in every song and how it truly felt nostalgic in the right ways. My favourite song in the movie has to be 'part of your world', that song made me cry, it made my inner child very happy!

I wanted to also point out how amazing Ursula was in the movie! My favourite villain and Melissa McCarthy did an outstanding job on portraying her! The song 'poor unfortunate souls' is perfectly portrayed, the whole scene has to be one of my favourite scenes in the whole movie!

The rest of the cast did very good too! But these two stood out to me the most!

The only complaint about the movie that I have is how they animated flounder.. I get it's supposed to look realistic in some way but... Flounder was so emotionless looking. He did not feel like the Flounder I always used to know which is sad.

Overall, I would love to watch it again one day!"
"Pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed it.I was very on the fence about this movie...

Growing up, Ariel was one of my all time favourites, so I was so scared Disney might mess up yet another live action, as they have the tendency to do; leaving me yet again disappointed at a ruined classic.

BUT... Thankfully, I was pleasantly surprised!

From the first scene, you are greeted with the kind of feel good nostalgia that few things can provide. The music, costumes, scenery, colours & charactets pull you into the carefree world you've come to love in the Disney movies from your childhood.

As someone who has been in Disney World, I was instantly taken across countless miles to Orlando, Florida; as before tonight, that was my most recent interaction with the Little Mermaid. Yes, folks, that's how good this film is in transporting you into the world of the Little Mermaid that made its way into your heart all those 25 years ago.

There are new songs, some minor added scenes, a beautiful love story; and characters you will feel you're seeing again after a long time, having grown and developed just as you have.

It also contains the most bittersweet cameo, fitting of the classic that it is.

This is your sign, go watch it."

"This movie was amazingHalle Bailey did her thing. She is a young black actress who is setting the bar for all the young black girls! I loved how the story line changed a little and i loved how the movie portrayed the real chemistry between prince Eric and Ariel! I'm not going to add in any spoilers. As a film critic I must say this movie blew my mind. The cast was good and Halle Bailey really brought this movie back to life. Everybody needs to see this movie and go into it with an open mind. This movie was made in 2023 so yes things are going to change to be more appealing to this generation. This live action movie really set the bar for other live action movies that will be coming out this year. Halle Baileys voice was enchanting and so soulful, my children say this version was better than the original."
"Wonderful adaptationI took the family to see this without many expectations as an adult male but I was pleasantly surprised. It was respectful to the source so it touched on our nostalgia but felt very much like a fresh take on the classic tale. Also, to my surprise, many people were crying at certain moments throughout the film. It was heartwarming to see so many people of different ages and backgrounds be so touched by a film they technically have seen already. Disney has done a wonderful job remaking and restoring a cherished classic and I look forward to enjoying this in as many circles and as many as is necessary to have my fill."
"I honestly kinda liked it nglAs much as people wanna hate on it, this movie was pretty good in my opinion.

While slow at times, the visuals were really captivating. The way they portrayed the sea is truly beautiful. It was not as colorless as people are claiming it to be.

The casting was okay. I did not mind it.

Halle Bailey did a great job portraying Ariel (not perfect, but great nonetheless). Her vocals were amazing and I can see why she was cast. Vocals: 10/10 gave me chills.


Melissa McCarthy honestly showed us a different perspective to Ursula- a more comedic one.










My favorite scene was the Under The Sea performance."

"A Magical Dive into the Live-Action Little Mermaid!Prepare to be swept away by the enchanting world of the live-action Little Mermaid! As a lifelong fan of the original animated film, I had high expectations, and I am delighted to say that this adaptation surpassed them all. It's an absolute treasure trove of visual splendor, heartfelt performances, and a captivating storyline that will leave you humming the iconic songs for days.

First and foremost, the casting choices were absolutely brilliant. Halle Bailey shines as Ariel, capturing both her youthful curiosity and indomitable spirit flawlessly. Her voice is truly magical, and she effortlessly brings Ariel's journey to life with her remarkable talent. She's a true modern-day Disney princess, empowering and relatable in every way.

The supporting cast is equally exceptional. Melissa McCarthy's portrayal of Ursula is nothing short of mesmerizing. She brings a perfect blend of wickedness and charisma to the character, making her a delightfully villainous force to be reckoned with. Jacob Tremblay as Flounder and Awkwafina as Scuttle add an extra layer of humor and heart to the story, providing the perfect balance to the more dramatic moments.

Visually, this adaptation is a feast for the eyes. The underwater world is breathtakingly beautiful, with vibrant colors, intricate set designs, and stunning visual effects that make you believe in the existence of a real-life underwater kingdom. The attention to detail is astonishing, from the shimmering scales on Ariel's tail to the majestic creatures that inhabit the sea.

One aspect that truly stood out to me was the music. Alan Menken's original compositions are reimagined with new arrangements, bringing a fresh perspective while maintaining the essence of the beloved classics. The new songs added to the film are enchanting and fit seamlessly into the narrative. And when the iconic ""Part of Your World"" begins, it's impossible not to feel a wave of nostalgia and joy.

But beyond the dazzling visuals and captivating music, the live-action Little Mermaid beautifully explores themes of self-discovery, acceptance, and the importance of following one's dreams. It serves as a reminder to embrace our uniqueness, pursue our passions, and find the courage to challenge the status quo.

In conclusion, the live-action Little Mermaid is a delightful and immersive cinematic experience that captures the essence of the original animated classic while adding its own magical touches. With a stellar cast, stunning visuals, and a heartfelt story, it is sure to captivate audiences of all ages. So dive into the depths of this underwater adventure and let yourself be swept away by the enchantment of Ariel's journey. You won't be disappointed!"
"Awsome movieIts good articulation of any story perfect casting and representation. My kids were happy to see the movie remake - the story was as is with some minute change but what else you expect from remake.

Cinematography is top notch and some of the scenes were every intense and emotional its amazing how real people and animation can be mixed in a way it provides pleasure moving watching for kids.

Many time the review is provided by parents and they miss to represent how their kids enjoyed vs how they see the story. Remakes are generally blamed for all such reasons to be unnecessary - believe me - my kids would prefer new this remake vs the original they may not even watch original for more than 10-15 mins."
"Awe and AmazementI absolutely loved this movie! I saw the original cartoon version when I was in 6th grade when it came out in the theaters. I fell in love with Ariel then and then to see the live action version with my daughter (9) and her 3 older brothers was one of the best days. This movie was wonderful! Were there some differences or a few scenes done a little different, yes, but they worked! It was fascinating to see how they were able to make it so magical and it not be a cartoon. I cried, smiled, laughed, and watched in awe. Love love love this movie!!! Even my 17 year old and my 13 year old sons thought it was done well and said it was good."

"I was sceptical but they proved me wrong: beautifully doneHalle did a wonderful job as Ariel and I was bought-in from the start. The chemistry between Ariel and Prince Eric was incredibly convincing, which I don't usually find with other Disney re-makes.

The CGI and colouring was spectacular and all-in-all I think the film was very well done, wonderfully cast, beautifully set and recaptured my love of the story.

I think Ursula could have been camped up a tad and I didn't get the eerie, uncomfortable feeling watching her as I do when watching the cartoon. As someone who grew up with the original, I really liked the film and would easily watch it again."
"Lil Mermaid was amazing. Incredible really <3I am in love with this movie, I think is literally the Best Disney Movie live-action they have made so far. Ariel's hair, face, tail, everything about her is gorgeous, her voice is truly enchanting too. Ursula was amazing as well and her singing was very powerful. Every character in the movie was well casted and they were all espectacular. Scuttle the bird was so funny, omg, everything she said had me in laughing tears, her song too was new and unexpected but so well done. The movie was so stunning, I was really impressed. I laugh a lot and I definitely want to watch it again, the music is amazing amazing !!!"
The bestCould there have been a better Ariel? Absolutely not Halle beauty not only shined under water but above her facial expressions and her voice was perfection! True to the story line of the og movie Ursula was perfect as well coulda did with out scuttle rapping it was cringe and Sebastian shoulda been cast as original Jamaican other than that the choreography was cute the 3D kept the kiddos engaged. Both son and daughter enjoyed the movie the end of the movie for sure had me in tears that was a nice surprise that wasn't expected so much favorite surprises included the village scenes and shuttle references to the location including the Caribbean since tales of mermaids originate there love it love it.

"A beautiful adaptation of the original!I was absolutely blown away by this movie! As a childhood fan of the original Disney movie, I couldn't believe how well done this was. I even caught myself singing along (to myself) and impressed with how some parts were even word-for-word the same. The actress that played Ariel had big shows to fill and she did a beautiful job. The cgi was impressive as well. It didn't look corny or over the top.

My grown daughters and I saw this in 3D and if you have the option to do so, I suggest it. The underwater scenes were perfect for this splurge. The voice scores did great and I wasn't distracted trying to figure out who they were the whole time.

Absolutely 10 stars!"
"More realistic approach to The Little Mermaid!A very stunning movie to watch in 3d. The graphics are just wow. The plot is amazing with its little alterations here and there as compared to the original version. The crab and bird are so so cute! I find this more feeling and realistic. The cast for the prince and Ariel are lovely. I never rewatched the original version except once or twice with my sister but this movie, I can definitely watch again because every minute is so interesting. Ariel's voice is astounding and I'm not at all surprised why she was selected to be Ariel. Plus, her emotions are clearly seen and felt. The movie was just fantastic! I would watch it again with family and friends anytime. Great job!"
"Be open.The movie was absolutely amazing. All the actors and team did a great job recreating The little mermaid. Halle voice is ethereal, I was overcome with pure joy listening to her awaken my inner child. We've all seen the original and I'm pretty sure we're aware it's all imagination so with that in mind, my imagination was completely fed watching this movie. The CGI team worked really hard and I thoroughly enjoyed watching behind-the-scenes after watching the movie because it truly made me appreciate every bit of it. Also the chemistry between Ariel and Eric is breathtaking, I'm really hoping Disney make a part two."
"An entertaining watch.My boyfriend and I went to see The Little Mermaid live-action on the premier night. It started with a bang, I was entertained throughout the over 2 hours + of singing and one-liners from Sebastian. I appreciate that they didn't stray too far from the original animated version, so that was a plus in my book. Loved Halle Bailey as Ariel though, her voice was undeniably good. Also, Sebastian was even funnier than the original. Skuttles song was a new addition and I laughed throughout his funny delivery. Ursula was perfect. I liked the live-action very much.

What I didn't like was that the lighting was horrible, way too dark and I was annoyed that her hair looked brown instead of fire-red. I also didn't like Prince Eric's solo, it was cringe and finally, the ending, even though it had some emotional effect, I was looking forward to the wedding scene and King Triton's ascending on a wave to hug his daughter goodbye and then sending her off with a rainbow overhead."
"Absolutely loved it!I enjoyed this remake of a timeless classic. It allowed for new aspects to be implemented into the film while ensuring to maintain the main components most remembered and revered in the original. Halle Bailey was a joy to watch and was truly mesmerizing with her voice and acting skills in correspondence with such a highly anticipated film. While I'll admit that Eric's character in regards to his storyline and definitely singing did leave a lot to be desired, it didn't distract from the movie's main focus. The familial chemistry between the father and daughter was beyond moving, as it reminded me of my own father and myself. As well as the romantic chemistry between Ariel and Eric truly built authentically throughout the film to allow a much adored crescendo. I can't wait to go see it again and I encourage everyone to do the same."

Loved itI always felt like Halle Bailey was going to be great and I wasn't disappointed. She embodied Ariel and the Chemistry between her and Jonah was palpable. I felt like the photo realistic Flounder and Sebastian was going to bother me but it worked for live action. I liked the additional Backstory for Eric and the relation between Triton and Ursula. I ended up seeing it twice once in 3D and once in regular. Highly recommend regular format but overall I enjoyed the cast and the additional musical numbers. It does the usual plot beats of the original movie but it expands on some parts of it. Melissa McArthy was great as Ursula and Awkwafina definitely did her thing as Scuttle. I really do recommend this movie for sure.
"Incredible movie!""The Little Mermaid"" has finally graced the silver screen, and it surpasses all of my expectations with its remarkable blend of stunning visuals, empowering representation, music, and an enthralling Caribbean atmosphere. The masterful storytelling and the talented cast's performances combine to create a truly magical cinematic experience. I loved it so much!!!

Halle Bailey's portrayal of Ariel is a revelation, as she brings a vibrant energy and a distinct depth to the iconic character. Ariel is a captivating and relatable young woman who defies stereotypes and serves as a role model for viewers of all backgrounds. And film does not stop at one instance of inclusive casting. It celebrates diversity throughout the entire cast, ensuring a rich tapestry of talent that accurately represents the world we live in.

The infusion of a Caribbean vibe throughout the film is a stroke of genius. I thought it elevated the film's atmosphere and took the musical experience to new heights. From the lively market scenes bustling with vibrant colors and energetic music to the tropical landscapes that evoke a sense of warmth and adventure, the Caribbean influence enhances the story's magic and offers a fresh take on a beloved tale. The blending of calypso beats, reggae undertones, and soulful harmonies added a refreshing twist to the familiar tunes, making them feel both nostalgic and invigorating. The choice to embrace the cultural richness of the Caribbean adds an element of authenticity and lends the film a distinct flavor that sets it apart.

I loved this film so much. Prepare to be swept away on a journey of love, self-discovery, and enchantment. Dive into the depths of the ocean and let ""The Little Mermaid"" captivate your heart and imagination like never before."

A joy to watchI honestly don't know what the bad reviews were talking about. This movie brought back all the nostalgia of watching it for the first time in 1989. Halley Bailey brought Ariel to life. I loved Sebastian and scuttle. The two characters complimented each other well and were believable. Unlike the lion king the animation worked! Jodi Benson was a perfect addition. The mermaid designs were gorgeous. The ocean was alive and beautiful. It was dark where it needed to be dark and colourful where it needed colour. This would not have been an easy movie to make. This is one remake I WANT to watch again.
"You either love it or you don't!If you really loved the movie when you were growing up! You're going to love this too! Trust! I was weary about Mellissa Mccarthy being Ursula but she did an amazing job and made it her own. Also, I had never heard of the guy who played the prince, but he did pretty okay. He's got a nice body. I think they wanted a fresh face. That or no one else would play him. Lol! What confused me was her sisters were Hispanic and she wasn't although her father was. I was confused kids will be too. I'm all about mixed families. All my nieces are Hispanic and I'm Caucasian, but I wanted a back story darn it. Go see it. It's so good if you loved the original."

"Ariel's Magic is Back & Better Than Ever!I adored the original animated version of The Little Mermaid when I saw it as a little girl and it will always hold a special place in my sentimental heart. This new version has so much to live up to - and it does so beautifully!

Let's start with Ariel - Halle Bailey is gorgeous, charming, sweet, and her voice is smooth and soaring. Jodi Benson's gorgeous voice made the original special and now Halle's has done the same - she makes you want to stand up and start singing right along with her! Ariel is key - she is who so many of us looked up to in the original and it is so wonderful to see that the creators of this new Little Mermaid have honored the original so well and have chosen the perfect person to portray Ariel. Halle Bailey is someone that this new generation of girls can look up to and pretend to be. She's perfect!

I also love Daveed Diggs as Sebastian! What a perfect voice for him and the way he creates the character is fun & delightful.

I truly enjoyed the entire cast and though I can't talk about every single character, I must also mention Ursula - another character with big shoes to fill and another successful portrayal by the versatile Melissa McCarthy. From the first word she utters, she's spot on.

Though I worried they wouldn't be able to match the magic of the classic, they did it! I highly recommend The Little Mermaid."
"Brilliant Live Action Remake of a Iconic MovieI absolutely loved this version of the classic Little Mermaid. I was so happy they followed the original story almost to a T, with a few minor adjustments. Casting was great, especially Aquafina as Scuttle. The Scuttlebutt rap was genius!! You can never go wrong with Melissa McCarthy, and Hailey was clearly the right choice to bring Ariel to life.

I enjoy all of the live action remakes, especially when Disney thinks outside of the box, when they promote inclusivity, when they celebrate all communities... it sends a strong message to little boys and girls that they can be anyone they want to be, even a mermaid :)

Well done, Disney!!"
"The Best Live-Action RemakeThe Little Mermaid has been brought to life in such a magical and amazing way, we have already gone to see it a for second time. Halle's performance of Part of Your World was so touching I found myself with tears in my eyes. Every single song, including the new songs that were added was done so beautifully and wonderfully, and there's even a really adorable and silly song that everyone will love. Each actor's portrayal of their character was spot-on and could not have picked a better cast.

I believe that this is easily the best live-action remake that has been made and I enjoyed every single minute of this movie."
"Overall great kids movie with excellent casting, aesthetics, and romance!As someone who grew up watching the original animated version of this story, this new film did not disappoint. I know that for undignified reasons, a lot of people have left negative reviews on this movie. I am here to point out my favorite aspects of the movie and any qualms I may have. Overall, I definitely recommend seeing this film as I found it to be a fairly enjoyable movie for various audiences!

My favorite aspect of this film that differed from the original was the romance between eric and ariel. Halle and Jonah did an excellent job at portraying two people from different worlds in love. So much chemistry!! I felt as though this portrayal allowed the audience to connect with the characters and the overall storyline more. This romance wasn't a bland guy-likes-girl plot point, it gave the audience something to root for. Although Ariel (obviously) wasn't able to verbally communicate with Eric for most of the film, the physical cues and obvious connection between the two allowed for a great romance.

One specific thing I noticed about this movie was that they included more internal monologue singing scenes for Ariel, which, again, gave the audience more insight into the character's feelings even when Ariel is unable to speak.

Another aspect of the film I really enjoyed was the overall cinematography. As I was watching this film I found myself really enjoying various scenes for their plot content as well as the graphic elements. Very pleasing to look at. This also contributed to how involved the audience became in the film.

One criticism I will leave is that I would've preferred more backstory on Ariel's family and Eric's as well. Although much is hinted at in the movie, I think it would've been more contextualized if we have been blatantly given these backstories. I would've liked to see more of the family dynamics especially with ariel's sisters. This film was overall enjoyable, visually pleasing, and well-executed."
"My grade school daughter loved it.Take my review for what it is. I'm not a movie critic. Zero background in films, acting, singing, etc. My daughter loved the movie. I liked the movie. Personally, I liked it better than the original one (We watched it last week, and I have to admit the old one is pretty dated.) We went to the 3D version. It was adorable watching her try to grab stuff out of the air that was ""floating"" in front of her. Halle Bailey's voice is beautiful. Gave it 9/10 stars as it is a little long. I was worried my kiddo would lose interest, but she didn't. Even wanted to stay for the credits so she could sing with the songs. Again, this review is just from the parent of a kid who wanted to see The Little Mermaid. Worth the money on the big screen for the effects at least and the kid loved the kid movie."
"Amazing Live Action Movie By DisneyOk so Disney has been recreating our beloved animated movies for some time now. I got to say my expectations were not very high on The Little Mermaid Live Action movie but I want to give a honest opinion. We are in a new generation with new generations comes change, and boy oh"" boy did the Mouse get this movie right! Ariel Ursula and, Prince Eric were stunning the cast was stunning! For a movie that was filmed during Covid I'd say they did a perfect job! I was able to understand the story line, my kids loved it, and the cast was outstanding! I can't wait for more Live Action Movies. Great job!"

"Beautiful singing!I cried at the end, the songs and ending is beyond awesome! A must watch with the family. The characters were amazing and i love that at the end both part could see each other's role and most importantly embrace their differences. Ursula gave me intense acting! I literally gasped out at some scene! Please watch this movie! I know it might look diffrent to the original but it truly was amazing to watch and everyone played their role well.

The song was trilling and gave me literally chills. Everything was just right, yes the first few scenes were slow but that's the point. It get really fast and love story didn't feel rushed either."
"A true gemThis movie is so amazing in many different ways. The acting, ocean cinematography, CGI/ special effects, the indept storyline and of course the singing. All of it comes together to create a beautiful film. I will definitely be watching it again.

Some of my personal favorite things about the movie. 1. Halle's acting - this girl is amazing being able to hold scenes without speaking isn't easy and she executes it every time.

2. The storyline - OMG Disney really took their time with this. Their are so many things in this movie that just make sense and expand the world in the best way possible. Just thinking about makes me excited!!! This is truly an amazing movies and worth the watch."
"Blessed movie & Halle Bailey is angelic! :)Halle Bailey was absolutely beautiful and heavenly for her role; she was the woman meant to be Ariel, & she is. The movie was good altogether. The cast, designs, clothes, details, and directors+other peeps who contributed came and slayed their job. I absolutely love Halle Bailey and her character in The Little Mermaid! Her hair was gorgeous, her singing voice was pretty, her spark was good, and I'm so glad the movie had a happy ending. ALL of the cast members played a wonderful part in this movie. I enjoyed the movie and definitely believe they should film the second one as well! Ariel is blessed!"
"Wonderful, must see movie! Will see again!I loved seeing this movie. When I first heard about the movie, specifically the casting of the incredibly talented and beautiful Halle Bailey, I knew that I had to see it. She is simply too talented to be in a lackluster production. I remember seeing the original animated movie and was delighted to hear that a new, improved, and ""modern"" version would be coming to screens around the world. A new, improved version that is more reflective of the diverse society we live in, which is always, ALWAYS the best way approach to take.

This movie not only FAR surpasses the original, but it is an amazing movie in its own right. Halle Bailey's singing, acting, and pure radiance elevates the movie to another level. I will be seeing it again."

"Better than the animated version!!Where do I start?! Halle Bailey was stunning. When Part of Your Wolrd came on I got goosebumps, gosh she brought me to tears, the emotion, the vulnerability and the power in her voice was truly unforgettable. She. Is. Ariel. Jonah Hauer-King did such an amazing job as Eric. I completely love that they gave Eric a deep and real backstory, he has hobbies, he's compassionate, he's curious. And the moment between Ariel and Eric were absolutely precious and I'm happy with their decision of making the romance a slow burn instead of love at first sight. I honestly had the best time, left the Theater with a big smile."
"Amazing ! Better than i expected!This movie was excellent. I think we were all nervous when it comes to Disney's live action animals but it all came together beautifully. People are gonna hate the movie regardless because they don't want it to be good.

I think the film gave us so much depth as it re-presented an old classic. All the actors DELIVERED and the entire theater was engaged all 2 hours and 15 minutes of the film. Most of the naysayers are just prejudice, miserable, and stuck in their own delusions.

Bravo 👏🏽 to Disney and Halle Bailey as ""Ariel"". I can't wait to see what else comes after this movie. I would watch again."
"Don't Believe The Negative ReviewsThis movie is absolutely incredible! It is easily the best live action movie released so far and one that I will probably watch more than its animated counterpart. The cast all did an amazing job, but Halle Bailey really shines. She embodies the character of Ariel. I can't think of or imagine anyone else who could have done this character justice. It's also visually stunning. I didn't see any issues that distracted from the movie like other people are saying. The way they fleshed out and expanded the story was so wonderful, I could barely even tell what parts were added (other than the new songs). This is just such a magical movie. All the kids on the way out were asking when they could buy it or when it would be available to watch at home. My nephew was captivated the entire time, barely made a noise for the full two hours, and can't stop talking about it. We'll definitely be going to see it again!"
"Amazing, exceeded my expectations!I was pleasantly surprised by ""The Little Mermaid"" movie. As a huge Disney fan, I have noticed that some recent live-action adaptations were leaning towards a more commercial direction that didn't resonate with me. However, this film exceeded all my expectations, particularly with Halle's portrayal of the main character. Her voice is truly remarkable, paying a beautiful tribute to Jodi Benson, and her acting is pure, sweet, and perfectly suited for Ariel. She embodies the essence of the Little Mermaid, and the movie itself is a captivating, well-directed tribute to the beloved 1989 original. Without a doubt, it has secured a place as one of my favorite Disney live-action adaptations!"
"Great MovieI agree with other reviewers that Flounder wasn't easy on the eyes (he was quite hideous)-but overall I thought the film was great. I loved everything about the colorful ""under the sea"" musical number and all the creatures. But Flounder just stuck out-he just wasn't appealing at all. But Halle did great and so did Melissa McCarthy. Overall, the live action followed the original pretty closely. I loved how the mer-people and island inhabitants represented all ethnic groups. The musical numbers were really good too. I wasn't sold on Melissa McCarthy as Ursula at first, but she did a damn good job! She was convincing as a villain and sang her bit off!"
"Pleasantly SurprisedI loved the original so much, I didn't think this could measure up. It was a gorgeous film! Well done and well acted. It held true to the original, while adding depth to the Prince Eric character and a few great new songs! I loved that the relationship between Ariel and Eric was more developed. There were minor changes, but none that mattered and some that improved the movie. There was plenty of humor, and I don't know how they made me believe they were truly under the sea! As for Ariel's change of complexion...I never even gave it a thought as we were swept along with the magic of it all. Melissa was AMAZING as Ursula! We already want to go back for a second viewing."
"I loved it!I've been waiting for this movie for literal years and it did not disappoint. This movie gave everything you expect from a live action remake and more. Halle was phenomenal, Jonah had beautiful chemistry with Halle. Melissa took such an icon villain with so much charisma and literally created something new yet familiar so you didn't lose that Ursula essence while still giving us something fresh and exciting. Visually breathtaking the images leaked were a little dark and there were concerns, but clearly that was not the case in the Final Cut. The music was out of this world. The scores though not surprised somehow we're amplified and even more epic than the original and the original is practically untouchable. Over all the long wait was not a disappointment and thank you Disney for finally producing something new for the little mermaid that wasn't a lackluster production like some of the others in the past."
"Pleasantly surprised at how enjoyable it wasI had low expectations for this as Disney seems to be destroying everything they touch recently. However, there were not the expected political and social commentary undertones- other than what always should exist in a whimsical movie, to be better. Halle Bailey is an excellent singer, however she shined as the mute girl who was so charming any prince could not help but fall in love with her. The placing of the ""kingdom"" in the Caribbean made the multi-cultural cast seem natural and unpretentious, which also contributed to more (than the original) great music. Notable roles, Javier Bardem (one of Hollywood's great Bad Guys) played an excellent Triton, and Melissa McCarthy was just over-the-top enough insane to do a believable Ursula. A great formula that may help win back many to Disney."
"This movie is fine, yall just want a carbon copy of the originalI have never seen the little mermaid in my life, ever, so this was my first experience with the story.

In general it was a good experience, the music is great, with a few exceptions, but, the only thing that i didnt like it was the underwater ambient. It looks like the props and actors were put over a video, it doesn´t feel like it was underwater, the cgi is bad in some scenes, more at the start where the mermaids are swiming around, they look like they were made in the sims 3.

Other thing that I didn´t like was that the ending feels rushed, everything happend fast, while the rest of the movie goes a bit slow."
"Halle Bailey IS ArielWhen it comes to re-imagining old classics, one will often look at the new version with a nostalgic eye. When it comes to ""The Little Mermaid"" you can see how they used this to their benefit. Halle Bailey performs as Ariel in such a beautiful way that I was moved to tears, reliving my childhood where I would sit in front of the big screen in my living room and watch the original over and over. She brought that fondness for a character I'd long forgotten back onto the screen and I felt like a kid again.

It's an excellent movie, from start to finish, and while yes the CGI is realistic, I personally think it's a good idea to have instead of some crazy cartoon crab singing along with a real person. The music flows, and the story captivates.

This movie is a Must Watch for everyone of all ages."
"Hale Bailey was incredibleHale Bailey's singing was truly amazing, and her acting was fantastic too. Her rendition of Part of Your World made me cry. You could tell she was actually singing in so many parts of the movie, which made her performance really powerful.

Melissa McCarthy was perfect. She hit it out of the park. So good.

It was funny, entertaining, and delightful.

Scuttle and Sebastian provided great comic relief and the visuals were gorgeous.

My six year old can't stop singing, ""Kiss the Girl.""

Sure, there were a few blunders including how they approached Prince Eric's adoption and some latent misogynistic tones to the overall storyline. This didn't stop me from enjoying it and wanting to see it again soon.

As someone who grew up on the original and loved it, this one is much better. Bravo!"
Absolutely BrilliantA tremendous film - TOP NOTCH! A huge achievement by all concerned. I loved it. My wife loved it. The look of it - the feel of it - the sheer joy and fun it portrays - all films are about love and this film has love galore. Can't wait to watch it again. It was a treat to see it at the cinema. Brilliant casting - everyone is really exceptional and I mean everyone. Already one of my all time favourites. I can quite easily see that this will be one of those films I will watch over and over. In my opinion it's much better than the animated version - not that I don't like that as I certainly do but this version supercedes it on every level. Watch and enjoy.
"Definitely my favourite movieAbsolutely breathtaking. Halle is the perfect Ariel and captures the essence of the character. Her singing is beyond and will give you full body chills. I really appreciate them keeping her dreadlocks, it really added a lovely texture.

Melissa as Ursula is incredible! And her singing is insane. The trio of Scuttle, Sebastian and Flounder are a lot of fun and will be loved by the kids.

The CGI is very well done and you can tell a lot of hard work and detail went into it. The on land locations filmed in Italy were so lovely.

My only critique is that I wish they gave Ariel one more outfit. Amazing!"
"Surprisingly charmingIt's different from the animation, but it's not by any means lesser. The characters got a new kind of dynamic I enjoy.

There are a lot of original charming moments and beautiful shots, this movie gots its own aesthetic and good qualities that make it stand out as a remake. The actors did such a wonderful job and the songs were sung in such a refreshing way!

There's one song that was a bit extra and can probably cut 10 minutes off, still, it doesn't overshadow this movie's nice quality.

Overall, it's a delightful movie I'm willing to watch again, enjoyed it, liked it, feeling glad I did not skip it due to the bad marketing.

Ps.

Don't walk into the theater trying to compare the animation and a 2023 remake, they both stand out in their own magical way."
"PERFECT CAST!BEST LIVE ACTION DISNEY MOVIE EVER!! Disney couldn't have picked a better cast for this movie. Loved everything about it. Can't wait to watch it again :)

All of the negative comments are coming from people being mad about her race is absolutely absurd. Grow up and realize that we are not in the past anymore. This is 2023 and if you are made about the color of a character in a children's MOVIE, that just means you need to dig deep within yourself and find peace. Halle clearly was the best and most talented for the job which is why Disney chose her. You people can keep being mad and leaving negative review but the box office do not lie.

Great work Disney!!"
"Beautiful Work From The Cast and CrewThis film provides a fantastic mash up of aspects from the animation, the broadway show, and sprinkles in enough originality to save the day! Halle Bailey is beyond phenomenal in every way. Daveed Diggs, Akwafina, and Melissa McCarthy added terrific elements of spunk. The humor and heart was around every corner. I was thoroughly impressed with the CGI creation of the ocean. My heart was filled with joy by Halle Bailey's gorgeous version of the classic ""Part of Your World."" I could not fully express my wonder towards the art of the film. Really, I could, if I had hours to spend discussing this masterpiece!"
"Exceeded all expectations! A genuinely lovely film.I grew up with The Little Mermaid - it was one of my all time favourite movies, and while I was excited to see this (because Halle has the voice of an angel) I wasn't expecting much (because Disney remakes have been less than stellar). But I was so pleasantly surprised by this version!

Halle is an incredible Ariel. Her voice is perfect and she nails the acting. Eric is more developed than the original and their connection is more realistic with a stronger foundation (I loved the mirroring of her grotto with Eric's study - a stroke of genius!) Melissa McCarthy blew me away as Ursula - she really killed the camp villainous vibe and was genuinely menacing!

Overall I was very impressed. There were a few aspects I didn't love (the lyrics in Eric's new song weren't great and the scuttlebutt song was unnecessary, though likely very enjoyable for kids) but the emotional core was very well done, the updates to the kingdom/setting were a vast improvement, and the visuals were fantastic.

I'm not too proud to say I cried a few times in the theatre! I'll definitely watch this one again."
"Fantastic All- Around!The imagery, updating, music and cast were all delightful! Our entire family really enjoyed this film!

I have a hard time believing any of the super low reviews are even real. Everyone I know that has seen it has loved it.

The casting was spot on with Ariel and Ursula being perfect. Scuttles voicing was pretty fantastic too. Sebastian was as well.

The changes to the story kept it fresh without deviating too far from what we all know and love about the original.

Please see this for yourself. Throw politics out of it and just watch the movie. Watch it with a little girl and see if she isn't in love with it. That's what it's about folks."
Loved this version!Super fresh new way to project the little mermaid loved seeing the characters in a more realistic light! Great musical energy emotional ending child friendly. It's not the original but I mean the original is the original this remake was great! The fact that there's a mixture of culture and color and vibrant energy and environment throughout the entire film it's giving fresh and new ! Loved triton as a Latino lovedddd loveeddddee loveddddd ursela as McCarty she was a legit star! And most certainly loved Halie as Ariel she looks amazing sounds amazing her voice is so much like the original and she was a super gorgeous mermaid!

"AMAZEBUBBLES!!!But...sadly...there is a huge movement giving this movie ""one star"" online (without ever having seen the movie) because they truly believe this MERMAID is ""greatly miscast"" because she is supposed to be a white red-head(?)...while there are others keeping their children away because they think this movie is just about a girl who sells her voice just to ""get a man"" and kids should not see such tawdriness! But truly, this movie is many thousands of leagues beyond all that...and in the most incredible ways. This movie is about a determined, intelligent, vibrant young lady who trades her voice in exchange for having the repressive bubble she is expected to live in burst so she can go out and explore living in a whole new world. After (silently) doing so, she creates a voice that is so much stronger than anything that can be heard only by a prince. I loved the cast of this movie and I now don't think anyone could ever play Ariel better than Halle Bailey - and rest of the cast was beyond - Melissa McCarthy! I saw this in 3D and it was one of the most visually stunning, entertaining movies I have seen in a very long time. And the end...well...I'm not too proud to admit that I think some of those mermaids may have ended up splashing a little water in my eyes. 🐠🦀🌈🌊 Loved it all. 💝💝💝💝💝"
"My kid loved it.I generally don't enjoy the live-action remakes, but this one gets a 10/10. Just enough has been changed, and just enough has been kept the same. Halle was an amazing and inspired casting. Prince Eric was also cast perfectly. Scuttle was my favorite character in the original so at first, I was sad he was changed so much. But then I grew to enjoy Awkwafina's performance.

Overall, it was well worth seeing. My 4 and a half year old and her 2 friends enjoyed it a lot.

The music was great! Nostalgia plus ingenuity.

I read just bad things about the Ursula makeup and actor, but she did an absolutely amazing job. A touch of modern humor in the song, a few lyrics skipped or changed but it was extremely well done. The eels were creepy. Javier Bardem was such a great King Triton.

I also didn't understand so many people disliking the realistic sea creatures. It's a Live-Action remake, a cartoon fish would've made no sense at all. Flounder and Sebastian had charisma and charm, while maintaining overall realistic features."
"This movie was Amazing!!!The songs, the music, and choreography, the whole movie was amazing and I was in tears at the end. Brilliant movie!! My favorite characters were Úrsula and skuttle. Skuttle was hilarious. She had my crying laughing throughout the movie. Sebastian was great too. Hallie was great as Ariel. I really enjoyed the new songs and will be getting the soundtrack. This is one of my favorite movie remakes because the Little Mermaid was my favorite movie as a kid. I love the new Melody to some of the songs as well. My favorite scene was at the end when all of the mer people came to say goodbye to Ariel and Eric! My family will definitely be going to see it again."
"I loved it. My 3 year old loved it.I grew up with the original little mermaid. I love both movies. Casting is great. The singing was incredible. I definitely cried in ""part of your world"". The ""Under the Sea"" scene was visually stunning.

It was different enough from the original to keep me engaged, but similar enough to keep it nastalgic.

My 3 year old prefers the live action version. (Daughter tricked her grandmother into taking her to see it a second time after I took her to see it in the theater opening day). It was not too dark or scary for little ones. She was on the edge of her seat. It was a tad loud a few times and she covered her ears."

"DO NOT PAY ATTENTION TO THE BAD REVIEWS, WATCH ITOkay...WOW! When this movie was first announced I was very skeptical of how it was going to turn out...but after watching it, it literally surpassed any expectations I could have had. I forgot the last time a movie brought me this amount of emotions. The auditorium was full and the movie touched every single heart watching. I couldn't quite hold back my tears when everybody started applauding, cheering and screaming in the last scenes! My inner child couldn't be any happier to witness such moment!

Hale Bailey was definitely the perfect cast. I really can'y picture anybody do this role after watching her! She definitely prepared herself. Everything from acting to the feminine mannerisms that make a Disney Princess!"
"My Favorite Disney Remake!The Little Mermaid has always been my favorite Disney movie. This remake was a perfect blend of nostalgia from the original film and new ideas. I absolutely loved Halle Bailey's performance. Her voice is beautiful and she played the role so well. I loved the parallels added to make the humans and sea creatures have similar ideas about each other and watching the change of heart from both sides was so heartwarming. This movie really fleshed out the relationship between Ariel and Eric, allowing them to have a more realistic connection through their mutual love of exploration and collecting trinkets, and showed growth in their love for one another over time. Rather than sticking to the cliche love at first sight despite knowing nothing about one another, this movie made Ariel and Eric truly appear like each others missing halves. I know some of the changes don't sit right with anti-revisionists, but I think every single change was a perfect choice that really enhanced the story and made it a beautiful artwork for the modern day. Absolutely loved this movie and everything it represents about giving people chances despite their origins and broadening your world through curiosity and exploration of the unknown. 10/10 from me, and I'm typically a harsh remake critic."
"Such an amazing moviePeople are not giving themselves the opportunity to see this wonderful movie, the scenes that are replicated are really amazing. It is true that there are some effects that look weird, but it has very emotional scenes and Halle she plays an exceptional role, she really makes you feel the movie. Listening to the songs you will understand why they chose it Disney modified the plot in terms of location so that there was congruence with the race of Halle, and I think they gave an exceptional touch to the film.

You should really give yourself the opportunity to see this beautiful movie with great messages."
"Filled with joy and laughterIt was such a beautiful rendition of the classic tale of The Little Mermaid. Halle Bailey was amazing, perfect for the role of Ariel. Her vocals were amazing. She did such an amazing job on the classics songs like part of your world. The sea witch was cast perfectly with all the subtle reminders of the classic movie. Scuttle was perfect casting. She was hilarious. Her rap song telling Ariel about Eric about to marry was hilarious had me about to fall out of my seat. Sebastian was perfectly cast. He was also hilarious with his little phrases. Good fun for all the family, new and old. I loved it. It was an amazing."
"Great remakeThe Little Mermaid"" brings enchantment and nostalgia to life in a visually stunning and heartwarming tale. This live-action adaptation of the beloved animated classic captures the essence of the original story while infusing it with a fresh and modern twist.

The casting choices are impeccable. The talented Halle Bailey shines as Ariel, capturing the character's curiosity, longing, and determination with grace and charm. Her voice resonates beautifully in the musical numbers, capturing the spirit and soul of the iconic songs we have come to love. Melissa McCarthy brought balance to the cast list."

"Phenomenal movieWent to watch with zero expectations, and that being a Little Mermaid fan since small. Didn't expect to be blown away, the cast is perfect and the direction was darker but brought up such emotions, in a different way as the animated original. Halle is phenomenal as Ariel and her casting worked in context of the reimagined world. Had doubts when she was casted but she more than proves her detractors wrong. She embodied Ariel and excellently showcased the varied emotions, even tne scenes where she was voiceless worked. And the chemistry with onscreen Eric is just oozing. Made me root for them more. Saw it the second time today."

"A great movie.I wouldn't consider this movie a masterpiece but it is absolutely a beautiful retelling of a story most of us know.

Halle Bailey did a wonderful job and really captured Ariel. I couldn't think of anyone else who could do it better.

The story needed updates and I'm so glad the direction they picked.

Having the story based in the tropics was a smart move. Made the music more light and fun.

Prince Eric and Ariels chemistry was off the charts and it's definitely more of a grow to love than the original. I feel like all the errors with the 1980s version was addressed and improved on.

I feel like the reason why this movie is getting so much hate is due to people not realizing their own racism. It's sad."
"Loved itI loved the original but when I watched this I found I loved this 1 just as much, the added parts of the story and songs just made it its own. The casting was perfect and I am glad that i gave it a chance. I will watch it again when it was released. I am really pleased with the film and any haters out there need to think of it as its own and not a remake of an animation just its own story like every other story and adaptation out there. The songs sounded amazing, I love the extra depth it goes into throughout the story. Hearing their thoughts and feelings some more through them just made it that much better."
"Loved everything about the movie.I think this was very well made and the singing was spectacular, children in the theater were overjoyed and the movie made me feel like a little kid again. Great acting in the costumes were very vivid in color. The littles girls were all dressed in costumes and it made it very festive in the theater, this is a movie that everyone should take their children to see. This movie is definitely going to be a hit because the movie theater was packed there was not one empty seat in the whole theater. Basically the same storyline as the first little mermaid just with different actors, going to take another group of kids this Saturday."
"Soulful remake.Halle Bailey's performance is stellar in this. I cried twice. The raw emotion she brings to the scene where she sings part of your world is unbelievable. And her singing brings a new life to Ariel. Not to mention the special effects, digital art, and visual effects it took to create this how well they did really is astounding. It's breathtaking and beautiful. The scene for under the sea was so visually dazzling that I wanted to clap in the middle of the theater. I even recognized some of the exotic animals used. It was really cool! Also they used a rainbow cast and that really enhanced the experience as well."

"Rekindling the joys of the Little MermaidMy daughter and I went to the movie to enjoy. She is a young adult now who LOVED the little mermaid years ago. The music, then, was very good. The music, now, in this one was Great! So good, that we sang along. The action scenes with the horse carriage and on the lagoon were so memorable and fun! We enjoyed this treasure. A new favorite, fitting for a mom and daughter date! The music was so lively and the characters on the beach seems to invite the audience onto the beach fun. The shoreline, to our surprise, was unremarkable. The Sea Witch Ursula played her role to perfection, however Arielle was the Star! We loved the movie!"
"Absolutely beautiful!I took my daughter and her friends to see The Little Mermaid and we all loved it! We sang, we laughed, we cried. It was my favorite live action Disney remake so far. I see why they picked Halle. Her voice was perfect! Her singing was amazing of course, but even her speaking voice sounded like Ariel from the cartoon. We were all blown away by the visuals. The underwater scenes were definitely my favorite. And I love that we got to know Price Eric a little better. It made his character much more endearing and lended more weight to their three day love story. All in all Disney did a wonderful job. This was a beautiful movie and I can't wait to see it again."
"Loved the movie!I first saw the original little mermaid when I was 4 years old and it has always been my favorite Disney movie! I rarely think remakes do a good job but this is one time that I disagree with that! This movie is fantastic, they did a great job keeping true to the story line but making it more modern and entertaining. Love Hallie and loved Prince Eric. Both did a fantastic job! Hallie's voice is amazing and the music stayed true to the original. Would definitely recommend and would probably go so much to say that I enjoy this version better than the original movie. Would recommend over and over."
"A wonderful, modern remakeI loved this film, it's now one of my favorite movies I've ever watched. After watching the remake, I went home to watch the original and it felt a bit flat. The remake just has more joy, more love, and the plot is just better. I've watched it now twice and I'm having withdrawals, going back a third time in four days, which feels too far away. Everyone in the cast did a phenomenal job but Halle was a revelation. Always know she was an incredible singer/ songwriter but the acting?!? She embodies Ariel so much, that same innocence, defiance, determination. Honestly it might be my fave Disney movie."
Not perfect but pretty good for another Disney remakeI miss original Disney content actually worth going to the theater for. I'll be honest I went to see this remake because of all the hype. I wanted to judge it for myself. I usually give these live action remakes a pass but The Little Mermaid came out the year after I was born yet I've only seen it a couple of times. It was never one of favorites but I do remember it having quite the following when I was little. So I gave this version a shot to see if I liked it any better than the animated version. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. I feel like parts of it could've been fleshed out more but they tried to shove so much plot in a typical if Disney 1.5 hours. I enjoyed the new direction it took and the new songs. Scuttlebutt had my whole family dancing! Overall I'd recommend giving it a go.
"We loved this movie!This movie did not disappoint. It had great graphics and cinematography, the story brought out all the emotions sadness, joy and laughter. Halle Bailey was a perfect choice for this remake. She is young, so beautiful and talented. We never took our eyes off the screen!!! Our four year old who had only been to the movies once before, was mesmerized by the real look of the mermaid tail swimming through the ocean. Halle's soft voice and vocals really sounded like what one would imagine a mermaid would sound like. All of the characters were believable and the actors did an exceptional job bringing the storybook to life!"
"Beautiful, colorful, and fun!I took two of my four children to see this movie. A 15 year old and a 5 year old. Both loved it, as did I! It was beautiful, I loved the new songs, my 5 year old really enjoys the ""Scuttlebutt"" song. I have seen so many reviews saying it's dark and gloomy. I must have watched a different movie. All I kept thinking, especially during the ""Under the Sea"" and ""Kiss the Girl"" numbers how colorful and beautiful everything was! When they go into town, it's colorful and lively. My 15 year old who grew up watching the original every night for months straight absolutely loved it. They want to see it again! We really loved this movie and I truly believe it's the best live action remake we've gotten thus far from Disney.

All the actors were brilliant. Javier Bardem was my only slight gripe and it's just because he took me out of it a bit. Halle Bailey was amazing. Breathtaking. Her voice is so beautiful. Scuttle and Sebastian cracked us up. Melissa McCarthy really stole the show when she was on screen. Her presence is just so powerful, and she really stayed true to Ursula. It was a wonderful movie and I highly recommend to anyone just wanting to watch a movie for enjoyment, not to nitpick."
"Well made remakeApart from Prince Eric wich I found boring, this movie is really well made and beautiful.

If you are a true fan of the original, you will like this one too !

Be open minded and and just enjoy it.

It reminded me of the way I felt when I saw the animated one for the first time.

Hailey did a great job, she is beautiful, charismatic and what a voice...a trully Disney princess voice. Melissa is just a terrific Ursula and Javier Bardem is just Javier Bardem, what can I say.

It's not an exact replica of the original one, but way more profound and Ariel doesn't seem just like a teenage girl in love...she wants something better for herself.

8/10. Can't wait to see it again, the visuals are amazing."
"Beautiful and vibrant remake of a nostalgic movie!It was a beautiful remake of a nostalgic movie! They captured the essence of the original soundtrack perfectly where you can sing along like you did 30 years ago! The music was wonderfully done and oh so powerful.

The graphics were wonderfully done. There were stunning scenes of marine life that made me want to be able to dip down into the big blue and see some of those spectacular creatures.

We could hear people throughout the movie theater laughing at the humor, including children's giggles at Sebastian and Scuttle's jokes.

It was enjoyed by multiple generations where the six of us who saw it all gave it a 10/10."

"Nostalgia at it's finestI don't usually leave reviews but felt I had to come on here and set some record straight.

I absolutely loved this film - Disney have done an amazing job!

I had huge reservations based on the negative reviews, but I was surprised at how good it was.

I grew up with the original and this is a more up to date version of it.

Halle Bailey is just incredible as Ariel, her voice is phenomenal, and she deserves the recognition.

The same can be said for Melissa McCarthy who sounded exactly like Ursula, she was scary but at the same time hilairious.

Skuttle and Sebastian provided great comedy.

I loved everything about it.

Go and see the film!!!"
"The Movie itself Was Great, People are just bored with problems that were already in the original!The movie has some lacks like in the sea creatures character designs. But, storyline wise it's pretty much the same as the original some parts are even better. No kids in the movie I went to were losing interest maybe it's your fault your kids can't sit through a movie. I care way more about Eric in this version and Ariel is way better of a character actions wise. Not to mention the musical scenes look beautiful. Most criticism of the film seems to come from the fact you didn't actually like the original story either and when you were a kid just liked big flashing colors to keep you entertained."
"My mom and I enjoyed it!I've always been a big fan of The Little Mermaid and when I heard it was going to be made into a live action film, I was overjoyed. I saw the movie the day before it officially premiered and I was not disappointed. Yes, it's different from the animated version and maybe it's a bit more mature and realistic, but those changes actually improved the storyline. The story and the characters are still there, just the way they get from point A to Z is different, but not in a bad way. Give the movie a chance before you decide to hate on it. Congrats on a job well done everyone! Can't wait to see the movie again!"
"Movie of the yearI looked forward to this movie all year. The CGI is AMAZING, Halle is an angel, Jonah as Prince Eric is a dream, and Melissa as Ursula was the best. All the new songs are so catchy, and the originals are even better. The film also made sure also to capture new ways to enhance the storyline and threw in a lot of new colors and visuals. It was just so well made, and you honestly can't have this beat. My favorite song is the new one by Jonah called ""Wild Uncharted Waters."" The song is so incredibly well made, and his voice is just..wow. Hands down the best Disney movie I've seen. Disney hit it out the park with this one."
"Beautiful!!!!This movie was the BEST remake Disney has done!!! Her voice was sooooooooo beautiful!!!! The CGI was beautiful!!! She's beautiful and of course all the characters were beautiful,phenomenal acting!!! I love the storyline. This was just a very well put together film!!! This was some of the best acting I have ever seen. I can't believe people have bad things to say about this movie other than the fact that this girl is a dark mermaid. How can people be so childish? Disney just honestly did an awesome job with this remake and there's nothing short that I can say. I am usually at her critic with judging movies, but this movie was just absolutely magical and beautiful. Her voice is just angelic and yet beautiful! She has the voice of a Disney queen! She brought tears to a lot of our eyes in the theater! Perfect person Disney!!!! Perfect! Haters will hate ! But Disney knew who was the better fit! Thanks Disney! Beautiful and magical as always ."
"Loved every minute of the movie!Rating this movie a 10/10! They did their best to stay within the story line while adding some scenes to add depth to it. I also like that they added new songs which helped so much with the flow of the movie. The animation for ""Under the Sea"" was my favorite though, but ""Part of your World"" doesn't fall far behind. I had goosebumps insome scenes and felt nostalgic. I just love it! I don't see why some people criticize it just because of superficial concerns. Everyone did an excellent job in their portrayals. Highly HIGHLY recommend watching!

"Best Disney live action adaptation to dateIn 1989 I took my first serious girlfriend on a date, we watched ""The Little Mermaid."" Since that time the music and story have been a part of my life, and the lives of 3 children I have raised.

I took a group of young people from a church group to watch the 3D live adaptation, many of them are African-Americans. The joy of watching them react to a heroine who looks like them was worth the price of the tickets.

Despite my viewing context, she transcended merely being an actor of color playing a role. Halle Bailey seamlessly WAS Ariel, lifting the story and character to new heights. Daveed Daniele Diggs made diminutive Sebastian as large as life, Melissa Mcarthy completely delivered as Ursula, and Johah Hauer-King capably portrayed Eric with the much-needed added dimension. I should simply say ""with dimension,"" as the animated Eric had none - this was one of the writing improvements. I was not crazy about the Scuttle character, Buddy Hackett was incomparable, but there was a bit lacking with this portrayal. Perhaps they needed more of a reboot on this one?

The effects were as colorful and as stunning as Disney can deliver, the cgi worked as well as it has in any film. Both the new and the existing music enhanced the story and the visuals with magic worthy of Disney's golden years, evoking laughter, tears, and a renewed sense of wonder. The overall effect was more than a love letter to the source material and provided enough expansion and freshness to make it feel like a brand new yet familiar film.

No movie is without sin, but this one will undoubtedly go down as one of the Disney greats and will prove worthy of multiple reviewing opportunities."
"Go watch it now!First, let me start off by saying that I am not a fan of live action remakes. Normally, I can't stand them. As an 80s baby, I like my classic cartoons to stay cartoons...But for this movie, an exception was made and I was NOT disappointed. The Little Mermaid was always a favorite in my house, with myself and my own children. Despite the ridiculous idea of giving up your life for a man you've known for less than 24 hours, the idea of exploring a world unknown resonates with many young children including mine.

Halle Bailey was absolutely magnificent as Ariel. Not only was she bright-eyed and adorable with her flowing locs, her singing and acting were top tier. Definitely a shining star. The removal of the cherry red hair and inclusion of locs was also a definite plus.

I found the CGI and colors to be phenomenally done considering a large majority of the movie is in/underwater. Anyone who has ever been in the ocean at any considerable depth knows it's dark down there. Expecting bright, ""cartoonish"" visuals would be ridiculous and Disney nailed it. As expected, Sebastian and Flounder looked like real sea creatures, CGI no doubt but a real not cartoonish.

Let's talk music. While there were a couple of added songs that I could have done without, they were tolerable. The other songs made up for those. Part of Your World, Kiss the Girl, and Under the Sea...yes, yes, yes. *chefs kisses* Poor Unfortunate Souls definitely could have been better but it was acceptable.

Now, the one person who didn't quite nail their character was Melissa McCarthy. She just didn't quite give me the camp of the original Ursula. But the visuals & those light-up tentacles were enough to push her and make up for her sometimes flat delivery.

This movie honestly exceeded all expectations I had and may make me go back and watch a few of Disney's other live action remakes."
"Great movie despite not being target audienceAs a 22 yo guy going into this movie I was expected to not enjoy the movie that much since it's a kids movie. But I really enjoyed it despite it not being targeted toward me. Honestly, I could see this movie being a little scary at parts if I was a six year old kid. The casting and acting was great. The animation was really well done and it doesn't stick out like a sore thumb. Some people didn't like the CG of the companion animals, but I think that's subjective. I think the CG/animation blended really well alongside the live action elements. They obviously do look a little strange side by side in the live action shots, but I think it's just about the best you can do in that situation. Especially because I'm used to the live-action/animated combo movies of the early 2000's that looks absolutely hideous. The movie was also well written and paced as I was entertained and laughing throughout the movie."

"Loved it!I really enjoyed watching this remake, although I'm not a remake fan... Halle Bailey did an awesome job!.. She was truly a great pick to star Areil... She's a beautiful young lady and she has a beautiful voice, it you're gonna be Areil you've got to have ""that voice"" ... And that Prince Eric was a cutie!... I loved the cast, everyone was great... The singing was on point, I was surprised that I remembered the words after all of these years😁... The movie took me back to my childhood days... As a child I watched this movie over 20 times 😁... Good job Disney, no complaints from me on this one... I would pay to see it again... I really loved the movie!"
"I would give this 100 stars if I couldThis movie was absolutely beautiful and very well done. Halle Bailey stands out as an absolute knockout with her gorgeous voice and adventurous spirit. She embodies the character of Ariel perfectly. Melissa Mccarthy does an exceptional job as Ursula. It was fun and the new songs were enjoyable. My only complaint would be that they kept her in the same dress the whole time on land, but even then that is such a small issue. I can't wait to buy the soundtrack. I got literal chills when Halle started singing. I also greatly appreciated the Easter eggs to the original story. It was very clever and beautifully done."
"I want to be A Part of this World!The Little Mermaid live action remake was a great movie!! Halle Bailey was amazing as Ariel, from her facial expressions to her stunning voice, she was perfect for the role!!! I'm so glad for those 2 hours I was a part of her world!!! My poor unfortunate soul was elated that Melissa McCarthy was selected to play Ursula!!! Again, perfect casting choice!! I loved the original songs as well as the new ones, and the additions to the script gave Ariel and Eric a much more endearing story. The supporting cast playing Sebastian, Scuttle, and Flounder also did a great job! We have the soundtrack on repeat and we will be seeing the movie again in the theater!!"
"AmazingI absolutely loved this movie and think that it could easily be one of the best live action remakes that Disney has produced so far. (A very close second to Cinderella because that dress - to. Die. For.) I loved the new character designs for the sisters, and both Halle Bailey and Jonah Hauer-King ate their roles up. Their performances were spectacular. I loved the addition of Eric's song to the movie. My only complaint is that we didn't get the iconic transformation scene with the silver transformation dress (if the people that did Cinderella's dress could have been apart of the design for this dress it would have been absolutely stunning, and would definitely have surpassed Cinderella as the best live action remake for me), but otherwise an absolutely astonishing movie."

"Perfect live actionThe previews don't do this movie justice!

The movie remains true to the original but has a modern shift in the message for everyone to learn about being able to be true to yourself.

Make sure you pay attention because the script will answer literally any questions you may have has from the original movie.

The casting... Spot on!

The songs were mesmerizing and Halle was the perfect mermaid. Her body language really captures the curiosity of Ariel. Ursala was comedic but definitely paid homage to the original.

Disney got this remake right! I'm already set to see it again! The first watch was in 3D.

Worth the watch!"
"LOVE IT! My favorite LIVE ACTION Disney Movie!The Little Mermaid was my favorite Disney cartoon movie and now the Live Action is also my favorite Live Action Remake. They did such a great job with casting Halle Bailey, Melissa McCarthy and Jonah Hauer-King. They absolutely nailed it. Halle honors the orignal while adding her personal flair. Jonah surprised and impressed with his solo song. Melissa was a wonderful and dishy Ursula. The special effects underwater were beautifyl and of course they weren't too realistic because it is about a mermaid in the ocean. My children love this version and want to see it again. This soundtrack has been on repeat since we saw it. Thank you Disney, Alan Menken and Lin Manuel Miranda."
"BeautifulOne of the best live action movies Disney has made so far! I was not expecting something. The Little Mermaid is an absolute classic. The music is catchy, special effects were dreamy and the characters are lovable. Ariel is such a relatable character, and her journey to find her place in the world is both heartwarming and inspiring. She did an amazing job. The film is a wonderful reminder to follow your dreams and never give up on what you believe in. The Little Mermaid is a timeless tale that will continue to captivate audiences for generations to come. I'll watch it 100 more times. Amazing!!!"
"This is THE live action!As I'm sure we've all come to love the original, this live-action really takes it to a different part of the world.

First, the singing is infectious! From the amazing Halle Bailey to the Shocking vocals from Mellissa McCarthy, it was literally hard, to contain the joy I got from the impressive revitalized versions of these already timeless songs.

The meaning of this live-action truly differs from its animated tale. It dives into a deeper level of what it means to love but to also follow your own path in life. This film shows me what it means to choose YOU. I think this film not only speaks to kids from the surface, but it speaks to all of us that are a little older that below the surface we have to choose ourselves at the end of everything.

Final review: A+

It's an Amazing movie, filled with wonderful singing, graphics, and acting.

*Like in all my reviews, I recommend watching it for yourself to experience the film/show yourself!*

Happy Watching!"
Best remakeExcellent remake. Halle did a great job and executed the role. I appreciate the visuals and time and details that were place to make this movie. I am most likely going to take my child to see this again and invite a few friends to see it with me. I cannot fathom how someone could not enjoy this film to be honest. It is everything I imagine it to be. I hope you read this review and enjoy this film as much as I did. Judge for yourself because some reviews may not be accurate to your feelings once you go see this movie. I can't wait to own the copy I may keep it for antique purposes as well. Good job disney.
The BEST DISNEY REMAKEHalle Bailey embodied the character of Ariel so perfectly. She was stunningly beautiful and her voice was so majestic and powerful. I almost cried. It was so sweet to see her chemistry with Prince Eric throughout the film. It was really nice to see them add more to the story and really give them time to develop their love. Adding in the siren song made things make more sense as well. The little changes made the film special. Halle Bailey has that unique whimsical otherworldly like beauty to her that really made her character come alive on screen. I hope she wins a I hope she wins an award. Great job Disney!
"Top tier remake...Would watch again!!!We watch a lot of Disney movies and The Little Mermaid is one of a few top tier remakes. Halle sang her heart out, and she made the songs her own. All of the actors did a great job remaking this Disney classic. A lot of work went into this production and it shows. The animals were full of personality and the on screen chemistry between Ariel and Eric was not over the top. We sat a little closer to the screen than usual and it immersed us in the movie. Small moments in the movie have been re-imagined but it only adds to the magic. I would have loved more comedy from Melissa McCarthy because she's hilarious but there was a good balance of the storyline and comedic breaks from other characters throughout the film. I loved it and I'm looking forward to the next Disney remake."
"Tells a better story than the original in most waysThis updated version of the little mermaid story takes the original plot and adds much needed depth to the relationship between Ariel and Eric. In this movie, the two of them share the same passions and desires that go much further than simple physical attraction and Eric falling for his ""savior"".

Some of the underwater scenes were a bit stiff compared to the way one might expect them to move under water, but the visuals were bright and magical, which made up for it. I do wish they had filmed more of the scenes under water, or at least made the actors work on moving a little slower and fluidly, as if they were actually swimming.

But anyways, the casting for all of the characters was pretty spot on! Ariel was innocent, curious, and charming, while Eric was adventurous, eager, and caring. Grimsby's character was also much improved, as he was almost like a father figure to Eric in the best way! It was also fun to get to see her sisters a bit more too."

"Loved it!Me and my daughter (17) absolutely loved this version of The Little Mermaid! The original animated version is my all time favorite Disney movie. Still and always will be my favorite but this one had me all in my feelings lol. I loved the realness of it and I actually liked the new versions of the songs. It gave us a broadway/Musical theater feel which we loved.

We actually saw it twice and I will say it was better in IMAX. The sound and color was a little dull on the regular screen which was weird in a movie that took 3 years to make 🤔

However I still think it was amazing and I will be adding it to my digital library when it's released!"
10/10 amazing movieThis movie is a must see the casting was perfect and the movie was fun to watch Ariel and Eric were perfect in this adaption the fact that they had shared interest and prince eric kind fell in love with Ariel without knowing about her being the one that saved him made me like the couple even more. Halle and Jonah were also perfect in their roles as Ariel and Eric as was everyone with their respective parts I would definitely see again. The soundtrack was amazing as well especially part of your world and Vanessa's trick. Also the actress who played Vanessa did very well the little screen time she had.
"I loved it.I loved this live action remake. I'm a huge fan of the original but I loved that Eric became a full formed character in this version and I thought they did a wonderful job of capturing the magic of the original. The cast were excellent. I was expecting to be disappointed but I was pleasantly surprised. I sobbed like a baby in "" part of your world"" and loved the addition of Eric's song which showed his yearning for Ariel. I thought the action was well done and the music was great, with the exception of under the sea which needed that Caribbean drum beat. This movie holds its own and I loved it."
"The Best Disney Live-Action Yet!I must emphasize my profound admiration for The Little Mermaid, as it holds a significant place in my heart. Given my deep connection to the original film, my expectations for its successor were exceptionally high. However, I am elated to report that this cinematic endeavor exceeded all of my anticipations. It adeptly preserved the essence of its predecessor, evoking nostalgia for those who cherished it during their formative years, while seamlessly incorporating innovative elements that distinguished it as a standalone creation. The introduction of new musical compositions was a notable highlight, despite the varying reception of ""Scuttlebutt."" I firmly believe that younger audiences will be enthralled by its charm. To anyone who cherished this timeless classic in their youth, rest assured that its successor will not disappoint."
"Fresh from the oceanSaw it last night, and it's brings back my childhood memories. And i still loved it! Is there some things I wish Disney didn't change, yes, but definitely still enjoy it! Halle as Ariel is good, I had no problem, she has a very beautiful voice. Melissa as Ursula also good. I just wish they make flounder more fluffy, and Sebastian eyes & lips bigger lol. I like '89 original Sebastian accent though. The song n music is great 👍. And the animation is beautiful 😍. The colour is so vibrance. Despite all the hate, I suggest just watched it and try enjoy it! Overall it still a Disney worthy movies! 👍."
"Beautiful in every way.This movie was breathtaking with the amazing underwater scenes. Halle Bailey was an absolute star with such an incredible voice. I really appreciated how they revamped Ariel's attraction to Eric. They made it about his kindness and personality instead of his looks. The subtle change in the lyrics to ""Kiss the Girl"" were wonderful as well. All in all a worthwhile remake. Will be going to see it a second time! This was my daughter's (5yrs old) first movie in a theater. She has been begging to go back and see it again. I definitely recommend seeing it in the theater if you can. The sounds and visuals are great on the big screen."
"We loved itMy 6-year-old daughter and I loved this remake. I was a HUGE fan of the animated version as a child, and this movie didn't disappoint. I loved Melissa McCarthy as Ursula (I would really like to see a movie based on Serena Valentino's book ""Poor Unfortunate Souls"" with her as the lead), and think Halle Bailey was a great choice for Ariel, she has a gorgeous voice and played the part perfectly. While I wasn't a huge fan of some of the new songs in the film, it certainly didn't ruin it for me. It was fairly long, but my daughter stayed very focused until the end (which is hard for her to do, you know, being a 6-year-old!), so I'll take that as a win. She wants to go back and see it again with her friends, and I plan to make that happen."
This was a great live action remake!The movie was great the acting was good. The visuals were so great and the singing was awesome. I loved and my 1 year old loved it as well. Great job Halle Bailey Melissa McCartney and the entire cast I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I enjoyed Daveed as sebastian and awkwafina as scuttle the actor who played Eric did a good job. My only complaint is the way flounder looked and king triton was a little too stiff to me. I loved Ariels sisters too. Halle's rendition of part of your world is amazing. Under the sea is still one of my favorite Disney songs. We had a great time watching this movie. I would recommend to all.
"Beautiful images but sea sickHalle Bailey is adorable and her voice is amazing perfect Ariel! Scuttle is so weird; could have done without his song. King Triton was adequate but not the powerful sea god I expected I wish we would have seen his castle and I wish they would have kept his singing daughters with the reveal of Ariel not being there. Sebastion and flounder were ok but not as fun as the original. Eric was marvelous and I actually loved all the scenes with him and Ariel that were added. I wasn't sure about Melissa McCarthy playing Ursula but she went dark, maybe too dark for my kiddo but thankfully it's so long she fell asleep before the end! My 11 year old struggled to stay engaged and said it was too long. And the sneaker joy for me was Jessica Alexander as Vanessa she was so good at being evil. Some of the under sea camera work made me dizzy and a little sea sick. Loved the nod to the original with the voice of Ariel handing over the baton ahem dingle hopper. Overall met expectations."

"I loved this movieAs a fan of the original movie, I must say, I loved this live version as well. Halle Bailey voice is absolutely amazing. I literally had tears in my eyes when she sang the hit song in the movie. The acting could have been better, but on a whole scale, I really enjoyed. I would definitely recommend. Please see it for yourself and not listen to individuals that are intentionally trying to bring down this movie. Movies like this are supposed to be fun. Why make everything, including a movie about a mermaid about everything else except what it's supposed to be. My advice, see it for yourself and use your own judgement."
"Worth the WatchIn short summary, it was fantastic.

While I am not usually a fan of remakes because originals are so incredible and classic, but his movie is an exception.

A little bit of background before providing details of the movie: My teenage son who is severely autistic, absolutely loves the original. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't hesitant to take him to see this as I didn't know how well it would all go.

I was worried that if it deviated too much from the original, that my son would not be able to stay engaged and enjoy it.

However, the experience was great for both of us.

The movie stuck to the original story and script for the most part. There were some additional scenes added for character development and a few new songs. There were some revisions to gender/race from the original, but they were cast amazingly and only improved the story.

I was incredibly impressed with the singing and acting, specifically for Ariel and Ursula. The CGI effects were incredible.

Not everyone is going to like this remake for various reasons. But I am thankful to have seen it and plan on returning again for an additional showing (or two)."

"Watch it thru your kids eyesAsking my daughter what is your favotire Ariel movie, new or old?

She said new! What was her favorite part? Ariel's hair, tail and Ursula's jokes. Kids don't make things complicated like we do, they just appreciate a good story😎

This was a well done movie! My kids always prefer the live action versions of all the movies no matter what. Lion King, Beauty and the Beast, The Little Mermaid, they are the same basic stories but seem more real and relatable. What is new to us will be the nostalgia for them. If 1989 Ariel came out to day it would be taken to the cleaners by critics. This one is better, not perfect but better! Enjoy it and don't over think it, it is make believe after all!"
"The best Disney live action so farWithout a doubt, this live action has created a lot of controversy for its main actress Halle, but it has given us a great lesson, she is the perfect Ariel, so I do think that both the protagonist and the male protagonist lacked some sparkle if I have seen them more intellectual with more curiosity both for the world on the surface and for the bottom of the sea or to navigate and get to know the world but I think they were missing something that they did have in the original, romance is much better understood in Live Action but their personalities they lacked spark. The great heroes of the movies were Triton, Ariel's sisters and especially Ursula, who both in the human version of her and in the octopus version of her, is absolutely wonderful and she wins you from the first moment."
Spectacular. My new favorite movieThe movie was beautifully done with so many layers. Each one was touching and made me cry and laugh and gasp with excitement. Melissa McCarthy's Ursala was Fabulously thrilling. I loved her. And they choose the perfect mermaid to play Ariel. Halle Bailey was superb. She was giggly sweet innocence. She was emotional and strong willed. She was beautiful and her voice alone brought me to tears. She was everything you believe a real Disney princess should be and more. She made this 50 year old grandma believe in mermaids and princesses and Disney magic again. Cannot wait to see it again and again and again...
It's the nostalgia for meI was 5 when the original came out and was excited to see the 3D live action version with my 5 year old daughter. Nostalgia for me and a new core memory for her made it special. I appreciated that the scores closely resembled the original songs but also enjoyed the new songs. (Halle Bailey's voice - swoon!!) I thought the new more detailed scenes with Prince Eric and Aerial during their 3 days together added something that was missing from the original. The casting was very fitting (I'm not even upset that Ursula wasn't purple) - they were true to the original characters but added enough twists to keep it interesting. We've been singing 'Part of that World' on repeat 💗 10/10!
"As great as the original, amazing cast, beautiful songs.Halle Bailey served a very good performance with a lot of charisma and passion, she also has an impressive voice. In some parts people were clapping from excitement and I shed a tear since I saw her performing her first song.

I'm not a big fan of the growing wave of remakes and live-actions but this movie is something that I couldn't miss, they revisited one of my favorite classics and the result is striking, extravagant, funny, exciting, it has everything I love. I had my doubts since I saw the cast and the character designs (not to mention Ursula's makeup) but these actors have a lot of charisma, the final result is solid and entertaining.

I love Alan Menken and Howard Ashman compositions, The Little Mermaid and Little Shop Of Horrors are my favorite works from them, their lyrics and arrangements give me goosebumps."
Absolutely a must watch!!!It's a must watch. It honors the original while still being relevant and adding new and fun details to allow the viewers to see the movie like never before. From the scenes to the costume designs everything is just stunningly beautiful. Halle does a great job really personifying the character of Ariel and making the viewer see new sides to her. Melissa McCarthy is excellent as Ursula. They could not have casted a better person. Anyone on the fence about whether or not to go see this movie should absolutely go buy a ticket. Right now it is worth investing into. Also the new songs give new life and perspective to Eric.
THIS MOVIE BLEW ME AWAYI am writing this review due to the unfortunate fact that I heard in the news about people posting false reviews to decrease the scores this movie gets. And in my opinion it deserves nothing but a 150 out of 100 as it was above and beyond - Halle Bailey was the STAR of the show and she just dazzled - She was magnificent!!!! True they deleted some of the best things from the original film such as the chef Louie scene and the original names of Ariels Sisters - but that didn't take away the splendor of this movie. True I was initially skeptical per Ariels lack of red hair but Halley's skin color doesnt change the fact that she was Absolutely PERFECT and talented beyond belief. Yes the original was a classic and always will be the first and animated one- yet this one is in a category all its own and shines in its own spotlight. LOVE LOVE LOVE and I would give it a million stars if I could! Don't miss out and whatever you do RUN don't walk to go see this film! BRAVO!!!!!
Amazing!!!Halle did such an amazing job. Took my little sister and her friends to see this and they had a phenomenal time watching the film. So much nostalgia and I love their choice for choose Halle. Her voice and acting was perfect! Literally had me in tears at times. I can't believe this wasn't done sooner! Did I mention Halle did amazing?!😁. Going to see it again. Heeehee. The girlies enjoyed it. One of my favorite movies in years. I cannot even wait until it comes out to stream and rent. Movie is very memorable. Grateful Halle even stepped up to go for such a role. Did not even think movie so be so awesome!
"Beautiful Movie!I loved it! Movies with the right cast are the best! Hallie's voice is beautiful, I thought it must be Idina Menzel singing, but it's not. King Triton was perfection and so was the Sea Witch. Melissa McCarthy reminded me so much of Kathleen Turner with her husky voice. I don't particularly like action remakes of great animated movies, but this one is my favorite. My sister recommended it to me as her favorite and it didn't disappoint. The children in the theatre were laughing in all the right places because they could relate and one kid clapped for 5 minutes. Disney has done justice to The Little Mermaid. Great job!"

Loved this movie!I have 3 little girls and they were inspired and in awe of how beautiful and fun this movie is! We saw it in 3 d and highly recommend doing that. HB has an absolutely perfect Ariel voice and Ursula was awesome! The music in this remake was a little different but it made this version special for this generation. The visual effects were stunning you actually felt like you were swimming along with the characters. The plot was a little different from the origional I think and some more creole aspects were added which made Ariel's time on land a bit more interesting. Overall I could not recommend this movie more!
"halle is the perfect ariel but deserved more justiceVocals are stunning. Point blank period and if u say otherwise ur a hater. Okay, otherwise...the character graphics umm a bit questionable. Obviously sebastian and flounder look a bit odd but guys, flounder is a FISH. And it's LIVE action. The mix with humanly and cartoony would not be good and very creepy especially for the kids. The way they had the mermaids swim are a bit weird. I kinda didn't like how they dragged out most scenes it made it kinda boring. The variety and quality of the outfits looked kinda cheap? Idk it didn't do it justice. Overall 10/10 i loved it and was in a trance the whole time. Go watch nowwww it's amazing."

"Finally they got it right!The live action Little Mermaid was an awesome movie. I took the whole family and we all enjoyed it. All of us, from the adults, the teenagers, preteens and 5 month old, sat through the movie with no complaints, totally enamored by the film. Thankfully, Halle Bailey did not disappoint. I love the Caribbean feel. The colors. The acting. It was all done so well, that I didn't even notice it was 2+ hours long. Founder didn't look as weird as we thought he would, because we were worried about Flounder, from the looks of the trailer. I was never a fan of Under The Sea, but I love how they changed it, it was more relatable."
"Best Disney Live Action Remake YetI love when remakes update the original while maintaining the magic. This is my favorite live action Disney movie yet. Our family is multiracial and it was wonderful to see that normalized in the film. It reminded me of the made for TV live action Cinderella with Brandy in that respect. The CGI animals made me tilt my head a bit, but our kids still loved the characters. Halle Bailey was the perfect choice for Ariel, her voice is on another level. My favorite character was Melissa McCarthy as Ursula. Her scenes were hilarious and so much fun. I loved the updates for Prince Eric- you could actually see why Ariel was so into him, unlike in the original where he gave wet blanket energy. I personally liked it better than the original and our group had a wonderful time seeing it in the theater."
"A MUST SEE for all kids not just girlsWent to see the Little Mermaid with a friend, we are both in our 30s and we absolutely loved it! The singing, the acting and the visuals are phenomenal. The cast did outstanding and I'm picky about my animations. I am returning this weekend with my sons because it is a must see on the BIG screen because you see all the colors, highlights and beauty of the film. I cannot say enough about how much I loved this film!!! Very true to original, I mean as a 90s baby I know Disney classics. This film was my favorite of Disney's live actions. I usually hate remakes but WOW!! This was so well done, loved Sebastián too! Melissa was (chefs kiss) amazing and Halle phenomenal. Each character held their own in this film."
"Loves every second of this!!!Went with my daughter (19 years old) yesterday afternoon in 3D. We have been waiting to see it ever since the trailer was released. We both LOVED it!! We can't wait to see it again!!!

When she was growing up I played Disney songs in the car and one of her favorites was and still is Part of Your World - when that part played she cried as it was a reminder of her childhood as it was part of mine!! What an amazing thing to share across 2 generations.

Halle Bailey was simply AMAZING as Ariel!! Melissa McCarthy was phenomenal as Ursula.

Loved that this wasn't an exact remake of the original, but instead stands on its own as a beautiful story."
"Fantastic reimaginingThe the new imagination to this movie is outstanding. Halle's role of the little mermaid seems to just be made for her. Her voice throughout is just mesmerizing bringing you to tears that it's just so intense that she's really embracing this role and then there's Melissa McCarthy who took the role of Ursula, and made her own somehow, but kept it to the original too. The roles of Sebastian and flounder are just as good. If you're a fan of the original movie, this is a must see. I don't know if I recommend it for the smaller kids can be intense a few times, and we noticed that the smaller littles got bored and restless but for us older people who grew up with the original it was just fantastic Run don't walk to see this remake. You won't be sorry that you did."

"The little mermaid reviewI loved Halle's performance as Ariel , she exceeded all my expectations. Nostalgia hit me hard during the viewing experience and I cried many, many times. Eric's character was also beautifully developed and acted. The cgi was incredible even though sometimes it was kind of dark in certain scenes. Halle truly brought Ariel to life and I can't imagine another actress doing it like she did. Vanessa was also great although I did wish she had a bit more screen time. I didn't expect Flounder's and Sebastian's ""animation"" to look like that but I was able to look past it because the voice work was great. Daveed Diggs and Jacob Tremblay truly delivered. Ursula and King Triton were terrific as well. Watch the movie , it's probably the best Disney live action along with Cinderella."
"Loved it.As it is hard to top any original film, this remake was well done to me. Music was great. Humor was good. Anyone who says it's bad I'm very confused as to how. Would absolutely see it again and again! Halle was literally glowing the entire film and was such a joy to watch. I have been following her for a while and I thought she did amazing. Melissa can do no wrong, as well as Javier. Typically I feel a certain way about the music in these remakes as it is a key part of my childhood but the mixture of old and new was perfect. I was still able to sing along to my favs while having new songs I want to learn."

"AmazingGreat movie , Ariel hair should have been red, don't know why they made it ginger/ brown . And if not bright red then a neutral red however apart from that it was great . The actors killed it , they really all suited their roles. Hallie voice is amazing it filled the theatre everyone clapped after part of your world , truly magical. I would say they should have added more humour as it was dark at times for younger kids. I liked how he figured out her name it was cute and funny I thought it was better than the original. Ariel isn't my favourite Princess however I would rewatch the live version."

"A beautiful reminder of my childhoodThank you Disney for creating this live action movie of ""The Little Mermaid"" it was so beautiful and nostalgic for to experience these characters and songs from my childhood. It is nothing short of breathtaking. The underwater world is brought to life with a vibrant color palette and exquisite attention to detail. From the shimmering scales of the mermaids to the graceful movements of the sea creatures, every frame is a visual feast for the eyes. The film's story tackles profound themes of self-discovery, sacrifice, and the pursuit of true happiness. It teaches us about the importance of staying true to oneself, the power of love and friendship, and the courage to defy conventions. These timeless messages continue to resonate, making ""The Little Mermaid"" a film that transcends generations."
"10월 10일This movie was wonderful. Halle is Ariel!! No disrespect to the original which is a great film as well. I loved it, my husband loved it and so did our kids. My youngest has locs and now she's begging to get them dyed to match. Lol she's only 11 though.

I cried after hearing Part of your World, The emotion Halle had put into it had me tearing up. You could hear the desperation in her voice and it was beautiful. She sounds just like Ariel. Her voice alone was so mesmerizing that it was enough for me to say it was a good film,

BUT don't get me wrong, the acting made its a GREAT film. TLM received a lot of backlash after hearing a black woman would be Ariel. Please don't hate the film because of that. Halles was casted as Ariel because she sounds so much like her. And Ariel's voice was the most important thing for this film. So of course she would be picked.. I encourage everyone to watch. It's just a warm deal good type of movie.

10/10."
"Gorgeous scoreThe music was the highlight for me. Beautiful orchestrations that gave me goosebumps the first time we entered the underwater kingdom. This was the first Disney live action where I felt the remake added something to the original. Everything was more intense with real actors instead of cartoons, from the shipwreck to the leads falling in love to the epic confrontation with Ursula. I also loved the secondary characters and the Caribbean village scenes. Ariel's sisters from the seas of the world were all so beautiful! It did run a little long- just cutting the pregnant pauses would have helped enormously. And somehow in 2+ hours we lost Les Poissons, which I missed."
"Simply beautifulIt was a colorful and beautiful movie that moved me to tears a few times. The scenes under water was absolutly stunning!

Loved the new songs except for Prince Eric's. I felt that there where no emotions attached to the words he sang. I thought the rap song was cute and I do not understand why people hate it so much. I loved the boat scene and them singing one of my favorit songs ""Kiss the girl""!

I missed Ariel's shippwreck dress! I think that one is too iconic to leave out. But Halie Baily was perfectly cast since her voice is amazing. When she sang she brought life to the Ariel I loved as a child."
"Black Female and White Male couple representationThe Little Mermaid 2023 is the live action adaption of The Little Mermaid fairytale which was originally adapted as an animated movie by Disney. It remains faithful to the original material for the most part, while also taking some liberties where needed, because no work can be consistently adapted into live action without having some changes.

Some important highlights about the movie, is firstly the stunningly beautiful visuals of the underwater world, the human kingdom and the palace, as well as the amazing musicals, especiallywhen Ariel herself is singing, and secondly the very good representation of black female and white male couples, which required more attention in media as this couple combination is very good in real life as well."

"Better than expectedThis movies has been getting so much hate since I remember. Today I went to watch the movie, to see if it was as bad as everyone say it was. But, it was better than I expected. I thought the CGI was going to look like Aqua Men but no. I feel everything flow with each other and the music was really good. . Especially, when Prince Eric was singing. It give him more personality than the cartoon version. Also the relationship between Eric and Arial felt more realistic and meaningful. Halle Bailey does a really good job as Arial and sings very beautiful. Lastly, I found flounder very adorable throughout the movie."
"Just BeautifulThis film was such a beauty. I loved seeing mermaids on screen! Childhood me would have melted into her seat if she were to see how they look like now! I'm so happy little kids will be able to see this beautiful adaptation. I really liked the new stuff/songs they added. I also liked that they developed Eric's character more and gave him wants and motivations etc, the original film just had him as a plot device. Halle Bailey was a perfect Ariel with such an amazing voice. Their chemistry on screen was perfect. Overall the film flowed smoothly, I think each scene tied in perfectly. I would have loved to see more of the mermaid sisters. Great cast, great music, and honestly the CGI was pretty good compared to other recent movies that involved sea folk/undersea scenes."
"Best Live Action Disney MovieHalle Bailey bodied this role as Ariel!!! Melissa McCarthy was a close second as Ursula!! This movie was absolutely amazing. I do wish we had a full scene with the sisters signing their song. Still a little weirded out on how Flounder looked though. The CGI was beautiful. Kudos to the entire team over at Disney and everyone one who had a hand in bringing this classic to life. I loved the original song ""For the First Time"" and Disney should definitely release that as a single because it is definitely a bop. Halle signing ""Part of Your World"" gives me all the chills. Her voice is absolutely amazing!"
"What a treat!This movie was very well done. I felt a range of emotions -from crying to laughing to feeling scared and worried to at ease again. It took me on a journey. I feel this version enhanced the wonder and the magic of the story. Halle's innocence captured through the silent acting and the singing! My god the singing! What a talent.

I felt the graphics were amazing. I watched it in Imax 2D and definitely recommend any enhanced viewing of this movie. There were a few added songs on top of the original and they may catch you off guard at first but not a big distractor. Overall, it is just a fun movie!"
"Well done! We loved it!I thought this was a wonderful reimagining of the original! The entire cast did a wonderful job!!! My daughter and I have been looking forward to seeing this film for so long and it did not disappoint! We enjoyed every moment of it. The songs were wonderful, the cast was wonderful and the graphics were wonderful. The under the sea scenes were beautifully done. We feel this is the best Disney live action film they've had so far! Everyone that I've spoken to that has seen it has also loved it so don't let the negative reviews fool you, see it for yourself. All the characters were played so well!"
"A beautiful filmThis movie is so beautiful and necessary for todays society. Inclusion and representation to bring inspiration to the youth is so important. Halle did an amazing job and left no crumbs. The visual effects are great. The casting is great. Everything was perfectly aligned in this film for it to be great and it has definitely earned its greatness. I waited to watch this film for 5 years, I was 18 when it was announced and am now 23. I'm glad it is finally out so now I can breathe and enjoy watching it again and again. I've already seen it twice and plan on seeing it again this week. That's how good the movie is. I highly recommend, please watch!"
"Great filmWonderful retelling if a classic. Halle Bailey is a magnificent singer and really does the part of Ariel justice.

The animal companions are a bit creepy and take some getting used to in live action. But besides that, it's so far one I'd the best Disney live action remakes.

I'm looking forward to watch this with my kids as they grow up, and hopefully they'll love it as much as I have.

I cannot put into words how great this film is and how much it deserves all op the stars it is getting. I definitely hope everybody is able to enjoy it, without judging it just because it doesn't fit their white supremacist world view."
"To the low ball reviewersI first saw the little Mermaid in theaters when I was 3 years old in 1989. That movie stuck with me as a kid. I loved and adored that movie and have waited 34 movies for the Disney live adaptation. Disney added a lot of elements from Hans Christian Andersen's telling. I love how they added some details of the original story in. The edit to the songs didn't impact the movie in my opinion. Everyone is entitled to have their opinion but let me address one thing- this is a Disney movie..... fantasy. It's a film. It will not be 100% accurate. It's made up. A fairytale. Disney just incorporated elements of an era. Yes I do too agree that some scenes the cgi was less than pleasing but once again it didn't take away from the performance of the actors or the songs. ""Scuttlebutt"" did indeed feel very out of place in the movie and felt awkward. I did feel some scenes felt sped up snd went by way too quickly. Overall I love how Disney choose to do the live action movie. The improved on the original. All their choices to not follow the original 100% I stand by. I do not mind that Ariel's iconic pink dress or her blue tour dress or her sparkling dress was not in the movie. I do not feel the magic and fun was taken away from this movie. Read Hans Christian Andersen's tale and see for yourself that the story has a undertone of ""darkness"". I think Disney really did justice to this live action movie."
Fantastic and impactful!!A fantastic remake by Disney! Vibrant visuals and great casting made this classic tale come to life! Disney remakes are sometimes questionable but they hit it out of the park with this one! And the musical soundtrack is fantastic in the film as well as for playlists outside of the theater. It was so inspirational to see Disney embrace the remake of this film with a current reflection of the diversity that we see in the world and clearly the success of this films shows that these types of adaptations are exactly what audiences are looking for! Kudos to Disney on the success of a fantastic film!

Live action remakeI hated when I heard they were making this live action remake. They've all been pretty bad so far so I wasn't interested. Then the cast list was released and I thought hmm. I thought maybe I might watch it when it's released on Disney plus. But once I saw the trailer I was too excited. I went to the theatre to see it. It was so good. It is definitely the best of the live action remakes. There was some smaller kids who simply got bored and wanted to leave but this isn't a cartoon so it's expected to happen. I was enchanted the whole time. Halle Bailey did such a fantastic job and so did Melissa McCarthy.
"The added bits added to the storyHaters are going to hate! The live action remakes have truly impressed with their new songs which seamlessly contribute to the overall story. Despite the presence of haters, this adaptation stands out as the finest amongst all the remakes. The utilization of CGI did not detract from the enjoyment of the film. Halle Bailey's portrayal of a beloved character was commendable as she skillfully stepped into the flippers of an iconic role. Lastly, surprisingly Melissa McCarthy showcased impressive singing abilities, proving to be a delightful surprise. I hope Disney learned from past failures and this is the process going forward."

"HALLE did an AMAZING JOBThis adaption by Disney was one of the best in a while. She sang with so much emotion. And the chemistry between Ariel and Eric was great. I also liked that they let the actors breathe when it came to their chemistry. I think people are too filled with hate when talking about this movie. Flounder could have been better though. I was also looking forward to Vanessa's song, but they didn't put it in, but the trick hymn they added was great too. I think the overall production was a success and the cast and crew should be proud. These songs will be stuck in my head. She gave the cartoon a run for her money."
"Amazing!Absolutely amazing! Part of your world gave me goosebumps, the emotion halle put into it was incredible!

Not a huge fan of the song scuttlebutt but the scene itself made us laugh, the relationship between Ariel and Eric felt real, live action Eric makes animated Eric look like a wimp!

This was my 5 year old's first cinema trip and she was on the edge on her seat the whole time! The shark scene and big Ursula may be scary to young viewers but nothing a cuddle couldn't fix.

Disney did really well with the casting, and Halle Bailey's voice is amazing. They were spot on with Vanessa and Melissa McCarthy is phenomenal in the role of Ursula. Was a bit put off by the look of Sebastian and Flounder in the promos, and all my kids were dancing and singing in their seats when Under the Sea and Kiss the Girl came on. There were some funny moments between the animals and overall the comic relief was really well done.

Would definitely pay to see the film again."
"LOVED IT!!!I normally don't like the live action Disney movies but this one did NOT disappoint! I even liked it more than the animated version! The music did not disappoint and neither did the acting! I even cried at the end of the movie and I wasn't expecting that at all! Thank you Disney, you got me again!!! Lol! The Little Mermaid has always been one of my favorites! I can say I was a little hesitant on this one, but now I can't wait to see it again. I went to see it in 3D and I think that made my experience that much better! I definitely recommend that everyone see it in 3D! This is a great movie for all ages and I really hope everyone gives it a chance! I loved it!"
"One of the Best Disney Live Actions!Let's start with the music. Halle Bailey did amazing along with Melissa McCarthy. It was a pleasant surprise to see her cast as the villain Ursula. It's not like me to like new music added into these live action films from the original, but Scuttlebutt and the For The First Time are great and catchy. I'm not a musical film lover either.

Nostalgic memories of my childhood did flow while watching and this live action did it justice. Akwafina did great as Scuttle and maybe even better. Enjoyed seeing Max the English Sheepdog too. Additionally, I loved the diversity in this film. I'm planning on watching it a few more times while it's out in theaters. Also, the soundtrack is on repeat on my playlist.

If you're not open minded you probably won't like it. At first I was a bit biased by the cast but I overlooked it and it's an amazing film. I'm not sure why so many folks are getting triggered so easily by this fantastic film."
"Amazing performances by Halle Bailey and Jonah Hauer-King!!I went into this film with tempered expectations, remakes are always tough.. Very hard to match or eclipse the original. But I was VERY pleasantly surprised by how this film pulled me and kept me engaged throughout.

The two leads Halle Bailey and Jonah Hauer-King are exceptional. It's not easy to give a ""subtle"" performance in a musical yet these actors did just that. They are very likeable and believable and have great chemistry.

Saw it in 3-D and def felt like I went for a magical ride, taken to a different world. Almost like going on a ride at Disneyland but for 2+ hours and without the lines:)"

"Solid Live ActionEvery time Halle Bailey sang, I got goosebumps. She was absolutely fantastic as Ariel and captured the essence of the curious, young mermaid exceptionally well. Bauer-King and Bailey had wonderful chemistry together and I enjoyed learning more about the character of Eric. They added enough new material that it kept the plot interesting, while still retaining the core aspects of the original. That being said, there were bits that were choppy (they really did not need Scuttle's song) and I'm still not a fan of expressionless live action animals. But overall it was an entertaining new take on an old story."
Beyond my expectationsWhat a beautiful remake. I think the vocals in this movie are the best that any Disney movie has ever accomplished. Halle Bailey is a legend already. After this performance she is one of the best. I love all of the slight tweaks the director took to update and bring this beautiful story into this century. The only thing that could make this better is if it was as originally intended as two male leads. 😊 xox. I think the only downside which was minute was the fact that the King was cast to someone I think could have been of more substance. The role seemed to be too forced. I would have also loved to have seen one of Ariel's siblings to be more well known. But overall I will go back again and see this movie again and probably again and again.
"A beautiful recreation!This is such a beautifully done remake! I was unsure of how I would like a classic favorite of mine being redone, and this is just what I hoped for! It is still a children's story, but with inclusivity that has long been lost on pop culture. The imagery was beautiful, the humor was on point, and the cast was perfection. The musicality of the cast is beyond what I had hoped for, and the nods to the 90s animated version were appreciated without overwhelming the new ideas. My favorite bit of recognition for the 90s version was the passing of the torch, so to speak. The humorous writing, stunning vocals, artistry and mixing the old with the new all makes this the next favorite of my classic go to film. BRAVO!"
"Absolutely magical retelling.Felt like an upgraded and evolved version of the story we know and love as if I was watching. Broadway adaptation. Halle's voice is magic, Melissa is In her best role to date, abs the visuals are vibrant and beautiful with plenty of comic relief. The best live action , and the only necessary one alongside Cinderella - yet. The chemistry between Jonah and halle is palpable, the supporting characters are given more depth and the the tropical island theming and cultural integration gives this version a life of its own. CGI feels very stylistic and the fantasiful realism used works better than promo skits for characters like Sebastian first alluded to. Everything feels cohesive and well thought out, you will love it - I've seen it three times in New Zealand theatres already!"
"Hallie is the perfect Ariel. Reimagined classic is so much fun!I LOVED this version of the Little Mermaid. I've been a Little Mermaid super fan from a young young age- to say the least. (I can recite the original almost in its entirety. 😳lol)

The cast and crew did a wonderful job transitioning to live action and even reimagining some important lines/moments/scenes. Halle Bailey was a PERFECT Ariel!! It was wonderful to see the ocean and Eric's kingdom come to life. I enjoyed all the new music.

The only reason I didn't leave 10 stars is because there were a very minor cuts that I would have liked to see and flounder was pretty pathetic. I really liked the changes to Kiss the Girl but the changes to Poor Unfortunate Souls didn't seem necessary (it's the best part of the song!)

All in all as someone that has watched the original countless times, I couldn't have enjoyed this more and can't wait to see it again and again!"
"Brilliant. What I expected and much more.I've been waiting ages for this to happen and it was worth all the waiting. As my fav Disney movie since I was little, this new movie is like a dream come true as an adult. The moment I saw Halle in action I felt chills all over me, she is perfect, she's Ariel. Period. The rest of the cast is perfect aswell, but she's the star here, and exceeded all my expectations. Same as the movie, in my opinion they filled some gaps missing in the original story, giving more context to the relationship between Ariel and Eric. And I loved those new scenes and songs. Magical, unforgettable movie. I went to see it 3 times and I just can't get enough. Thanks to everyone who made this possible because it's simply amazing."
"Great adaptationHalle Bailey shines in the titular role, while many of the other cast are equally well cast, especially in comparison with their animated counterparts. The film keeps a lot of the pacing and elements of the original while bringing a new reality to the story.

I didn't mind the animation with Daveed Diggs' Sebastian. There was enough humanity and characterization with features like the eyes and the overall personality that kept it from being an uncanny valley situation. Flounder, however, was a bit harder for me to get past the realistic traits. His features seemed much more deadened in comparison to Scuttle and Sebastian.

While I am not a fan of Lin-Manuel Miranda, his new song for Scuttle fit the updated characterization. The changes made to the other songs were subtle and well-needed. I also appreciated that Eric gets a bit more meaty part in this film, and he is also very well cast.

Finally, as a huge Ursula fan, I was worried that Melissa McCarthy could not carry the role to its true evil dimensions. All my fears were put aside after her first interaction with Ariel, and from there, she truly became the character! The CGI and camerawork accent Ursula's evasive, stealthy nature as an octopus, and McCarthy's sweet face with a big voice made the character all the more menacing.

If anything, the screening I saw was often very dark, and as Ursula's lair is in the depths, and a lot of the scenes revolve around events in high stormy seas, it was often hard to follow the action. I will date to say this is my favorite Disney ""live-action"" adaptation to date."
"Beautiful Timeless Magic!My friends and our children loved this movie. I loved this cartoon movie as a child and seeing it come To life was really a dream come True and really exceeded my expectations.

When the movie opens the scenes of the ocean really impressed my 5 year old son. ""Bro this is awesome!"" And that was pretty much the experience for the whole movie.

All the haters just love to kill joy, plain and simple.

Halle is amazing as were all the actors involved, really there was never a moment when I was removed from the experience due to bad acting.

Also I really appreciate the difference in this movie when the man finds her and helps her after she gets her legs and is rushed to the surface, thus being an example to boys and men everywhere in how to treat and protect girls and women."
"Super talented casting, great songs!!!I wasn't a fan of the little mermaid movie, but I went to watch it as soon as I saw the casting... And it did not disappoint! All of the characters gave 100%, I loved the way they brought it back to life, the remake of the original songs and the new songs. I also loved how they highlighted the curiosity of Ariel to explore the world.

Hale Bailey, is by far the most talented artist I have seen playing a Disney Princess, I keep on listening to her version of the songs. She deserves all the positive reviews as well as the rest of the casting. Melissa and Awkwafina were super enjoyable, loved them!

Kudos to the casting director!

When it comes to movie directing and CGI, it could have been done better... I feel like the actors were the ones who made this such a great movie!!!"
"I really liked it!I have never fully watched the original even though I know most of the hit songs from the original. I'm not a Disney adult and I don't really watch musical ls and Disney films at all but I thought Halle's singing was amazing and she was a great Ariel. I know her from her music group she does with her sister and she impressed me so much!!

The supporting cast was pretty good; they didn't wow me but they sold it to me! I thought Melissa was really good as Ursella although I couldn't always catch everything she said (and I wished her makeup was more dramatic). I Prefer animation over live action cgi, and I disliked the way some of the animals looked when they were released before the film premiered. However, watching the movie, I actually liked how Flounder, Sebastian and Scuttle looked in the film; overall I thought the film looked beautiful!

I really enjoyed the filmed and I found that the ending was really touching and joyful. I find myself still thinking about it hours after watching and I would definitely watch it again. To me, that makes it a hit!"
"Best Disney live action everThe new Little Mermaid movie starring Halley is a delightful experience. Her captivating presence and magical essence make it impossible not to love her. Instead of comparing it to the old version, embrace it as a fresh and unique take. Remember, we will always have the cherished cartoon version. Approach this film with an open mind and no preconceived notions, and you'll be rewarded with a movie that you'll thoroughly enjoy and fall in love with. The stunning visuals, captivating performances, and heartfelt storytelling combine to create a truly enchanting experience. From the breathtaking underwater scenes to the emotional depth of the characters, every aspect of the film is beautifully crafted. Halley brings a sense of innocence, curiosity, and determination to her portrayal of the Little Mermaid, making her a relatable and endearing protagonist. The supporting cast also shines, with standout performances from the likes of Sebastian and Ursula, who add an extra layer of charm and villainy to the story. The music is another highlight, with new songs that are both catchy and emotionally resonant. While the film takes some liberties with the original story, it does so in a way that feels fresh and adds depth to the narrative. Overall, the new Little Mermaid movie is a must-watch for fans of the classic tale. It manages to capture the essence of the beloved animated film while also offering something new and exciting. So dive in and let yourself be swept away by the magic of this enchanting retelling."
"Everything the cartoon was meant to be!I loved it! They did such a good job! It was close enough to the cartoon that there weren't any real surprises if you brought kids, but different enough to keep you interested. I liked small tweaks to the story line so it made more sense. The only thing that I didn't love was Ursula's dialog. It felt like she was just laying her plan out so we'd understand why she was going after Ariel. So I get why it was necessary. It just felt poorly written and awkward. Other than that... the tropical island setting, the new songs, the small tweaks, and her amazing voice(!) made it so fun and enjoyable! I love musicals, so this was an easy win!"

"Adored this film!I thought this was one of the best live actions Disney has produced! Halle did an incredible job portraying Ariel and the rest of the cast did not disappoint either. I'm tempted to go to the theater a second time just to watch it again! The movie stayed true to the original in almost every way and overwhelmed me with nostalgia seeing some favorite characters come to life.

I got chills from Halle's voice singing the classics and new music. Adding in the new songs was a great way of including originality paired with the classics. Overall the film was a great adaption and love action remake, so much so that I needed to leave a review."
"Just really happy about this whole production!I am overjoyed at how wonderfully they managed to pull this off! While I can find some things to nitpick that I wish would have been handled differently or included the way they were in the original animated movie, this live-action offering is a beautiful and soulful re-telling of the story that has been with me since childhood :) I was getting goosebumps multiple times and felt myself be taken in by the charismatic and authentic performances of all the cast members but especially Halle Bailey and Melissa McCarthy! I couldn't imagine a better Ariel after seeing this and Ursula is as good or better for me than the original even (actually I can say the same about Halle, atleast vocally she's my favorite english-language Ariel so far!) I really don't see how anyone can hate on this movie compared to the 1989 version, since all the important scenes and story beats remain and are done in a way that honours the source material. So so happy with it and will be watching it again in the next days!"
A Movie Full of Life and Heart.I usually don't do this kind of stuff of reviewing but after watching this movie I felt compelled to. This movie is a PERFCT rendition and masterclass of how to do a live action from animation. From the A class caliber acting and casting to yes Ariel herself. We all know that story of the Little Mermaid and know what happens but as I watched the movie with my family I couldn't myself but too root and still immersed in its outcome. It's just an awesome feeling of great celebration to love and unity! The trolls and critics must truly hate their own lives to continue hating after watching this movie.
"Great watchWent and saw this on Memorial Day with my wife and oldest son. All 3 of us loved this live action remake. 9/10 because there was a scene with prince Eric that I thought didn't make much sense or add to the story telling of the movie. Great casting, Halle Bailey sounded just like the cartoon version of Ariel when singing. Melissa McCarthy did a wonderful job as Ursula and I thoroughly enjoyed Daveed Diggs as Sebastian. My wife and I talked about going back to see it again in theaters except maybe in 3D next time. Visual effects were very entertaining, especially when recreating ""Under the Sea"" scene and the boat scene with ""Kiss the Girl""."
"I loved it!!I really enjoyed the writers fleshing out the love story of ariel and erick! They were so sweet but still allowed space for Ariel to be her own person (mermaid, lol). All of the underwater sequences were amazing. They put a ton of work into the cg elements of this film and it's really beautiful.

I loved the original, but thus remake made the scary moments scarier and the funny moment funnier. Everyone was more human and grounded. Not to mention Halle Bailey we such the embodiment of Ariel from the way he voice sounded to her attitude and spirit. I highly recommend this film, it was a joy to watch!"
"Better than the original.This movie exceeded my expectations. The cast was absolutely fabulous and Halle Bailey was so enchanting as Ariel. She was made for this role, and her chemistry with the actor who played Eric was so lovely to see.

I also really liked the updates they made to the movie. They cast and crew truly came together and made magic on the screen.

The visual effects were some of the best I have seen from Disney in a while.

I remember watching the original when I was 7 and I was NOT impressed. This version blew me away! I am so happy little girls have this updated version.

I will definitely be back to the theater to watch this again!"

"Endearing, funny, fresh but still true to the originalEndearing, funny, fresh but still true to the original. I laughed, I cried, and just loved every minute of this.

The visuals were stunning, Halle's voice is beautiful, and I enjoyed getting to know more about the Prince and seeing more of him and Ariel together. It made their love story more convincing and they were just very sweet together.

We've seen how hard it is to do a live-action remake right, and Disney have done a pretty great job here. My only gripe is that I think the last quarter of the film felt a tiny bit rushed but otherwise even Lin-Manuel Miranda's songs in this couldn't affect my joy watching this (I'm not a fan if you couldn't tell). I know I'll be rewatching this countless times in the future.

Special mention to Melissa McCarthy who was BORN to play Ursula, and the diverse casting which made my heart very happy."
"Gorgeous ProductionOnce again, Rob Marshall has astounded us with his masterful and artful direction in this adaptation of The Little Mermaid. The vivid colors brought the musical to life and left me enchanted by the two worlds of land and sea. The musical numbers were gorgeous, powerful and impeccably timed- and far exceeded my expectations. The theater was filled with laughter and excitement coming from children. The acting truly captured the essence of the story's charm, drama and comedy. This cinematic feat, half of it taking place underwater, is a testimony to the ingenuity of modern filmmaking. As a child, I dreamt of this live adaptation coming to life. And finally, it has arrived in all its luxurious, magnificent glory. I, along with my father, was moved to tears."
"Fantastic! A must see in 3- D on the big screen!Halle Bailey is Fantastic. Her singing gave me goose bumps. I've already watched it twice in theaters, and it was even better the 2nd time in 3-D. The new songs are enchanting, and loved the extended new scenes. The actor playing Eric is wonderful. They have great chemistry together, and Melissa McCarthy is a delicious Ursula. I've been a fan of Director Rob Marshall's Chicago, and he does an excellent job with this musical. Lin Manuel Miranda's new songs are very good. Can't wait to see it a 3rd time to share with friends. This will be "" part of my world"". I only wish there would be a sequel. Would love to see a new adventure with the actors and this team again."

"Definitely one of the better live action remakesFlounder lost his charm but I never really liked him much anyway. Sebastian was pretty good. Scuttle alright. Thought Melissa McCarthy would be better but still alright. Jonah Hauer-King as Eric was alright. Halle Bailey was great. So sad about the hate she's received.

Overall pretty good. It doesn't really have the charm of the original and I don't think any live action Disney remake ever will. Have to leave that expectation at the door and try to enjoy it for the reinterpretation it's trying to be. It is too long though. Nostalgic adults don't need it over 2 hrs and the little children which will make up over half the audience certainly don't. Rarely do newer inserted songs ever hit as well as the classics too. Maybe one new would be enough. Thankfully no one part really felt like it dragged on, but overall could have been 20-30 min shorter. Nevertheless I enjoyed it and so did my kids (10 and under)."
"Not PERFECT but Best Live Action Yet!A lot of people are being hard on this movie based on the CGI. I thought some scenes like Under the Sea, were beautiful and the lagoon scene was exceptional. Halle Bailey could just sing Little Mermaid songs for hours and I would still love it. She was SO endearing. I do think Flounder took a backseat, his design wasn't great, and honestly neither was Sebastian. He was a little too low energy for me, but I never watched the movie for them, it was always Ariel. I choose to rate this film on the performances. Halle, Javier Bardem, Awkwafina did amazing. Melissa McCarthy was iconic and hilarious."
"Disney's best one yet!This could be Disney's best action remake yet. There's no comparison considering the previous remakes such as The Lion King, Pinocchio and the likes.

Halle Bailey was outstanding, with or without her voice, she played Ariel so well & made being a Mermaid believable.

Her voice is so powerful and the singing was perfect. Definitely a great choice for this generation.

Of course, some of the new songs sound forgettable and could have been left out of this one. The missing one star will be for parts where the movie looked like a scene from Sponge Bob.

But all in all, an enjoyable experience that will last a long time."
