Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"I'll never understand why they always opt for realistic looking talking animals in their remakes.

They massacred my boys Sebastian and Flounder. :("
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Looking at these, I thought Nicholas Cage was going to be playing King Triton..."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"King Triton: I need you to step out of the sea, sir"
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Why do the animals always look scarier in these remakes?
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',My biggest complaint is everything from the trailers just looks so dead and colorless.  Especially compared to avatar 2.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Oh, Halle Berry!

*squints*

Oh."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"They’ve turned the cute, lovable Sebastian into pure aquatic nightmare fuel"
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',All of these posters look like AI generated art that was done on the way to the meeting to present them that started 10 minutes ago.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Flounder and Sebastian look ridiculous.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Those sea creatures are creepily deep in the uncanny valley... They should have either gone all in cartoony or all in realistic.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Why is everything so dark, even the human characters in the sun have their faces in shadow and Ariel's poster is so dark, you can only make out her face. The animals also seem washed out, have these people seen a coral reef or watched blue planet?

Bring out the color, showcase it, why is this so hard?"
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Oh god it looks so bad
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Sebastian looks so fucking bad hahahahaha
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',They went out of their way to make Flounder as ugly as possible
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',I thought this already happened
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Flounder looks like he’s seen God
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Scuttle looks like he's about to kill someone with a fork
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Everyone upset with Black Ariel, here I am trying to figure out the casting of Melissa McCarthy as a character inspired by Divine? What was the thought process beyond larger woman = larger woman?"
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',The Shape of Water sequel is looking good
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',No thanks.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Everybody hates it. It makes a billion dollars. ^(repeat)
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Just fucking no.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',I'm a little worried that they learned nothing from their Lion King remake
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Lowkey a little sad they didn't go with a brighter red for her hair. IMO, it would have looked really great on her."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',This will be a shit show
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"> Awkwafina

Aight im out"
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Looks very bland. The movie will be panned down along with some trolls citing it as their win and media/Disney will catch these trolls tweets and claim “The Little Mermaid” was target of trolling and no one will care if it looked bland and disinteresting
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Flotsam and Jetsam look cool i guess
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Awkwafina? Someone is actually called that??
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"I just cannot convince myself this movie isn't fake, like it's like a parody of those shite live action Disney films. It's going to make a billion dollars and people will flock to it but STILL this is maybe the worst trend Hollywood has had film wise in a long time. Next they're going to remake the live action remakes back into animated ones I swear to god."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',They didn’t even try to make her look like she’s underwater except for that CGI’d ass hair behind her
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"""Excuse me where's the little mermaid theater for 7:30?""

'it's over there, UNDER DA C, UNDER DA C!'"
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"wtf are they going for with this movie? What is gained by making this live action? It looks bleak and weird and doesn't seem to improve on the original. Come to think of it, none of these live action Disney movies are improvements. They just seem like shameless cash grabs. Cringey era for Disney."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Whats the next Disney live action remake of an animated classic going to be? I hope they remake Brave, I've always wanted to see what Scottish people would look like in real life"
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"That Flounder scared the fucking shit out of me, i I saw that coming towards me and start talking, I would fucking run!!! (Or swim!)"
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"This looks so fucking goofy lol. Ofc it’s probably going to make a bajillion dollars and we’ll have to put up with more of this lazy, brain dead reboot nonsense"
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Really bad casting
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',No
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Nothing about this movie that looks remotely interesting to me
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Awkwafina…oh cool so it’ll just be her doing the same thing she’s done for forever 

Also why does Javier look like Nick cage??"
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Read that as Halle Berry at first.

Think she's 56 now, still fine but probably can't pull off playing a teenager."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Oh my god, the fish one"
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Seriously? They could have made Flounder look waaay better, but instead hes just a regular fish with 3 pixels of yellow."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',I REALLY miss the old school Disney vibes. They're ruining every IP they own now and blaming it on the audience. I think the last decent movies trickled out in the mid 2000's.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',As soon as awkwafina is involved im fucking hard passing whatever movie it is
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',At least Eric is still hot.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',I am of Danish ancestry and this film is offensive.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Those hyper realistic animal characters are so fucking awful. Like absolutely fucking terrible. I was never going to watch this because I’m not six years old, but god damnit. Even six year old me would have though this film looks ugly as shit. Fuck Disney for being so god-damn lazy. You have one job Disney. Bring children wonder. This isn’t bottom of the barrel this is underneath the barrel."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Isn't she a little old to be playing a teenager?
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Sebastian is giving me ugly sonic vibes. 

Also, inB4 this thread is locked"
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"I won't be watching the movie, but I will be listening to it. Halle has a great voice and its basically more covers of songs I love."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"I like the designs of triton's armour, but then Eric is just so plain :-("
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',This is going to flop so hard.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"One thing I don't get is, why didn't they make her hair red? She's a fictional creature yet Mera from Aquaman pulled it off. I like she dyed it with clay, but that impossible underwater."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Looks like more cgi trash. No thanks.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',I don’t like how nothing is brightly colored anymore. Everything is super dark.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Her hair should be more red it’s just brown
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',I’ll stick to the cartoon where Disney belongs.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Dollar Tree knockoff Halle Berry in the lead role.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',I want to see a remake of Tarzan with a black lead.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',[removed]
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"The trailers made me think Melissa McCarthy was miscast.  She's too soft-spoken to be Ursula.  I can see in her eyes that she's hoping her performance is good, rather than seeing Ursula."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',I thought this came out like a year or so ago. I feel like I've heard about it for ages
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',I can’t believe they’re casting a grouper as flounder. This needs to stop!
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',I feel like they’ve been promoting this movie for legit ten years
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"A story about a minor who really wants to fuck the handsome mid-20s guy next door, with the help of her local pimp."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',The idea of a 'live-action' film with talking animals peaked with Cats and Dogs.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"I wonder if the animators will include all the same phallic depictions, you know, to stay true to the original."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Haven’t watched the last few live action cash grabs, doubt I’ll watch this one. I honestly thought it had already released.

Hopefully we get some good memes out of it"
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"They played the trailer before the Mario movie and a little girl said ""That's NOT Ariel"" and the whole theater laughed."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Yikes
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Cant wait to see how they screw up the live action Stitch…
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"If they were going to change the names of ALL of the sisters, why TF didn't they just change the name of Ariel as well?"
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',The realistic looking animal thing they’re doing with these is so stupid looking
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Garbage
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',This movie looks so bad. 🐠
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Get ready for the most exhausting and stupid debate of all time over this movie. Normal people will just agree it's bad and move on, whereas dipshit right-wing grifters will lament its ""wokeness"" and Hollywood agenda, while knee-jerk activism-by-media-consumption braindead liberals will decry any criticism as racism and sexism."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',I already know Awkwafina is going to ruin this for me.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"🎶it’s so shitty (it’s so shitty), it’s so shitty (it’s so shitty), there’s no mistaken, this turds a maken no money. (It’s so shitty). You’ll never get this out your head, you’ll sing these words until you are dead, it’s so shitty🎶"
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"So, Cleopatras dad is white? Hmm"
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Woah Halle Berry is young looking still! Said myself unbeknownst of the modern crime of humanity false advertising
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"I do wish her hair was more red, it is such an iconic part of the Disney version of this character."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',They made Ursula white?!
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Soooo they’re going for the emotionless look with the sea creatures… because it worked so well in The Lion King.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Just because Jungle Book was a success, doesnt mean to they have to adapt everything else to a realistic looking creature. They never learned from Lion King"
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Shes white as a ghost with red hair, enough of the overly inclusive virtue signaling already."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',[removed]
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"The Little Mermaid is my favorite Disney film, and I think this is going to be lovely. You have to hope that they took A GREAT DEAL of care in honoring the source material (1989), knowing how many people love ""The movie that saved Disney Animation"".

I think Halle Bailey is a great choice and her voice is amazing, judging by the previews. I'm predicting that it will be a different spin, but a satisfying one, and I do hope that people give it a chance before knee-jerk panning a film they haven't even seen. This is a big responsibility for this young lady, and I hope people give her a chance."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',These are actually really nice
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',So this takes place in the Galapagos? Scuttle is a bird native to the islands
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',What's wrong with the Ursula poster? I can't quite put my finger on what it is but something just looks incredibly off
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"I've been ignoring these remakes, but I have a good chance of having to see some or all of it with my nieces at some point. The older one flashed me the biggest smile when telling me how the new little mermaid is black, like her. Yeah, it's a soulless cash grab by Disney, but if my niece enjoys it and feels a little better about herself, I'll deal with it."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"I actually like this kind of character poster

it seems like they're in a scene, and you shot them

&#x200B;

unlike some character poster, especially in marvel ones where it seems like they are in photoshoot or sometimes a badly photoshopped actor"
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Someday I will not read Halle Berry, but this is not the day."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"I can't wait to never watch this. The Little Mermaid was/is my favorite Disney movie, and so far all the remakes have been sad or terrible. Not going anywhere near this."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',I could have sworn that this movie came out months ago.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Lmao I hope Scuttle is as nuts as their appearance 😆
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Beautiful!
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Are people making as much noise over the dull and unsuitably potato-faced thirty-something Prince Eric actor as they made over the actress playing Ariel?
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',She’s just so pretty. And her voice is amazing. I’m super excited to see it!
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',I’m gonna stick with the live action Beauty and the Beast with Emma Watson. It’s a GOAT.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Wait…there are actual adults on here mad cause it’s not exactly like the cartoon? Lol
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Damn her hair is gorgeous in that poster.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"As thousands lean into their keyboards ready to type   how offended, oppressed, and triggered that she's the wrong race, skin tone and that none of the other fish or characters are trans."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Love Halles hair

Jesus getting downvoted that much for liking her hair? Holy fuck"
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Eric and Triton look great. The rest are either ridiculous or meh.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Wow the casting for this is great, looks how I remember the movie."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Good looking, even Melissa that i can´t stand its nice as Ursula"
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Daveed Diggs As Marquis de Lafayette As Sebastian
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',I wish they made her hair more red :/
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Halle Bailey? Halle Berry
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Holy shit Awkwafina is just so hot right now!
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"First Disney movie to make zero money, no way"
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"I wish Jacob Tremblay would do another live action, dramatic role. He's such a powerful actor."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Finally a fitting role for Mellisa McCarthy.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',I hope it's a good movie!
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Stunning!
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',I don't get how everyone is so pissed off at the Ariel casting.  That's literally the only thing I've seen about this that doesn't annoy me in some way.  I'll give them a chance as this story could actually work well in a live action presentation but I think they're gonna botch it.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"lmaooo has this not come out yet?!

&#x200B;

W all the racists losing their mind I assumed this came out last year"
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Anyone has textless?
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',You’re not supposed to want to fuck Ursula!
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Put YMS on suicide watch
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',[removed]
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',People are going to have so many opinions about these... But I can't get past the poor kerning.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Is Zack Snyder directing this?
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',They totally botched the animals. Christ how hard is this? How can anyone think those are acceptable?
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Triton and Eric's look like Gucci print ads.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Ah yes a walking cooked crab
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Anyone else find some of the characters to be very creepy? The whole thing seems so dark and spooky.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',king triton not hot enough
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',DAVEED DIGGS IS SEBASTIAN?!?!
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"I've only seen the original animated movie, so I guess I missed Flounder developing a meth problem."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"I’m getting Paul Dano vibes from flounder,"
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',I thought with all the complaints this already came out. You mean to tell me it hasn’t even come out yet?!
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Nah man, Imma watch Barbie and Oppenheimer, ON THE SAME DAY."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Everything I've seen of this remake so far is utterly awful, which would apply to every Disney live action remake before that as well. Even the singing felt hollow and lack emotion, it's just a lazy imitation of the original animated movie without the heart and soul."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Awkwafina continues her conquest of trying to be in every kids movie lol
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"cool posters, but wow Sebastian looks creepy to me"
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',That Sebastian looks awful
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Is anyone else seeing Brandon Fraser's ""The Whale"" face in Flounder?"
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"But really, does anyone else absolutely hate Melissa McCarthy in this?  

Like, all I can hear is a harsh discordant cackle, not someone who can be sultry and even a little seductive.

Couldn't they have at least gotten Queen Latifah?"
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Looks like a 'ill be waiting for it to come on Disney+ and then maybe ill watch it just to see how bad it really is' movie
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',We all know the biggest problem with these is the art direction (remaking it as an animated cartoon might be a better idea than these bland live action). But the casting for these is a close second. Melissa McCarthy? It is a name I guess.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',I read that as Halle Berry and became instantly confused at what year it is
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"The hyper realistic animals and Melissa McCarthy casting are still tripping me up. We shall see. 

On D+."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Why is flounder white? 
Gretchen: omg u cant just ask why ppl are white"
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Why does Javier Bardem hair look dry? Isn't he supposed to be coming out of the water.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Ursula along with Flatsom and Jatsom have the best designs. Melissa McCarthy looks great as Ursula and Flatsom and Jatsom actually look pretty terrifying but in a good way. The others look fine but Sebastian looks really uncanny with those eyes.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',The prince is very handsome
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"They got Ursula’s look spot on

But the thing is Sebastion one of my favourite Disney characters doesn’t look fun like he did in the animated version"
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Kinda wish they had use prosthetics for Ursula and make her generally scary to look at
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Fina with her blackcent...I.never really saw it as anything other than how she was. Apparently it's a thing she does. Wonder if she'll catch shit about it again. 

I hope not but with everything else this movie has going against it. I can see that being added to the list."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',I mean who uses a rectangular movie poster?!  It's so gimmicky!  And what is she supposed to be singing or something?  Not believable.  0 out of 5 stars.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Ursula's eels look so cool! Eels have got to be one of the cooler sea creatures.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Personally, I’m looking forward to Batgranny’s cameo most."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',So is Ariel still 16 and chasing that dude??
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Sebastian looks like crab...
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Somebody was spreading a hoax of what Flounder would look like a few months ago: https://amp.knowyourmeme.com/memes/live-action-flounder-hoax-little-mermaid

… honestly, I can’t tell which looks worse at this point"
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Such weird casting for Ursula and Triton.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Shouldn’t it be “lil mermaid”?
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Flounder isn’t even a flounder…
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Wow this is going to fail, looks horrible. Wonder what Disney will blame."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Seriously, why is Disney doing this to us? This is my favourite movie as a child."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Easy fix. 

Have the animals look like the cartoon counterparts to the merfolk and each other (and therefor also to us, the audience), but like 'real' creatures' when encountered by the humans. 

Sorted."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Is that the mermaids friend or something?
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"All the other issues aside, Melissa McCarthy looks like Marcia Gay Harden."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Why did they make eels the bad guy???
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',I’m ready for this to bomb
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"I usually don’t even bother watching the Disney live action because they’re so awful (I’ve tried to get through beauty and the beast, Aladdin, and lion king but had to turn it off halfway because it was so boring/irritating) but I’m holding out hope on this one being fully watchable. My prediction is that it’ll be uncanny and lifeless much like the others BUT I think Halle is a rare gem, her vocals are perfect, and she appears to have the charisma and energy to bring Ariel to life. I expect she’ll be the standout in an otherwise mediocre film."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',I hate the realistic animals but someone tell me why flounder is a Sergeant major fish?? There's literally an official  poster with a bright yellow fish with blue Stripes (Royal Angelfish). Surely that would have been a better pick? I don't think the original flounder was meant to be a sargent major fish so it confuses me that they didn't pick a fish that better fits his original look. Such a weird choice.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Live action remakes should stop.  
Hopefully after this flops, they will learn a lesson."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"[she looks all wrong, this is much more realistic!](https://ih1.redbubble.net/image.335585626.1313/flat,750x,075,f-pad,750x1000,f8f8f8.u3.jpg)"
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',It's a cursed image for sure.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Really highlights how stupid these live action remakes are and that animation makes the most sense for stories involving talking fish
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',He looks dumb as hell.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',All the posters just show Disney didn't learn from Lion King - afraid of color and sacrificing character and aesthetic pop for the sake of realism. Ariel's hair isn't eye-popping red and that alone is a sin.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Flounder? You mean [Kent Dorfman?](https://tenor.com/fr/view/animal-house-gif-9018501)
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Can’t believe they did Flounder like that.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Those dick-sucking lips...
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"These uber serious posters with these somber “For your consideration” Oscar nominee fonts is beyond ridiculous.  I mean honestly, what do they think they’re making here?"
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',It looks like a fucking mojarra. I'd have no problem eating it for lunch.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',I really love the human / mermaid character photos but the animal ones are oddly terrifying.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Looks like he's got Downs syndrome
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Rest in peace 😔
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"You would have preferred he have a big, giant fleshy human nose? Realistic cartoons are nightmare fuel."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Flounder looks like he's going through his emo phase.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"For real. [This ""deep fake"" video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1HGgICqZ3c) shows that you can make them cartoony and realistic."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',">I'll never understand why they always opt for realistic looking talking animals in their remakes.

I mean, that's part of the whole thing: If the whole point of the remake is to make it ""live-action"" they're hemmed in. if they don't make the animals look ""photorealistic"" then it's considered a failure full stop. If they make them look animated (i.e., you know, GOOD) then what was the point of remaking it in ""live action?"" 

The money is in telling the audience ""That cartoon you loved is real now, so you can love it more."" and in paying (non-unionized) VFX teams to be animators (who are unionized) and animate ""real"" cartoons instead of the ones that can actually emote. 

Why nobody at Disney has seen fit to consider maybe remaking these animated films.. as **newer animated films**... I don't know. Like, retelling the story, but with new voice actors, new story changes, new animation styles and techniques not possible in the 80s... like any other remake might do. It's not an option. Because the first and only option for an animated remake is to make it ""live action"" 

But it hasn't been a single one of these ""Live-action"" remakes (that are still 75-80% animated anyway) that has looked better than their animated counterpart. They've looked ""realer"" I guess... and considering why these are being made, that's the aim, and therefore sad Dallas on the Nostromo Killll meeeee Flounder is a SUCCESS."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Scuttle is a Nazca boobie, a type of bird near Mexico, Central America and northern South America. He also lives on the Galápagos Islands 

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazca_booby"
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Sebastián looks like dinner. it was passable in jungle book and lion king but i can't genuinely see Sebastian and have him give me any emotional response his scenes in the trailer look like tik tol dubs
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',It's pretty obviously why. If they make Sebastian and Flounder as a cartoonist caricature.  Then they will have to make every sea creatures and land animals as caricature as well.  I mean it would be kinda weird seeing a realistic human riding a realistic horse body with a caricature head.  Best thing is don't make them talk.  Making a realistic animal talking with their mouth movement is pretty cringe. Just make the her like she is talking to herself when she is communicating and responding to the sea creatures who are making bubble noises is more than enough.  But they can still make every animals/creatures as a realistic caricature because I don't think people even care since it's a Disney movie.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Because despite the film being complete dirt, The Lion King made $1.6 billion"
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',I'll definitely sign unto that outrage.  What are those creatures?  They need the sonic treatment.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"This is the most miscast movie I can think of. Why does Sebastian look like that? Did nobody working on this see finding Nemo?

And Melissa McCarthy does not have the right voice."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Yo seriously, if you think about it, it’s just a picture of a fish lol"
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"That irks you but not the fact that Arial was white with red hair?? Lol, what a fucking world.  Gotta have ""inclusivity"". Oh wait, it's racist saying that but not the other way around."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',I can't wait to see how nightmarish they're gonna make Tamatoa in that Moana remake
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',I am 100% here for Awkwafina as Scuttle but that fish is deeply upsetting and no casting will save him.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"That was my thought too. Like forget the skin color controversy, this is the big problem in my mind."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Probably to mesh with the human actors, so it all looks live action and not like a Roger Rabbit world."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Flounder looks like he has a receding hairline
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"It looked soo weird in The Lion King… you have all these realistic animals, that talk like cartoons. It feels like a huge disconnect."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Cute mascot ❌🙅‍♂️

Literally just a fish ✅💁‍♂️"
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',They look fine to me (???) because cartoony would just look silly amongst real people.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"I’m embarrassed to say that after 30 something years on this planet I only now found out that Sebastian was a crab. I thought he was a lobster. My entire life.

Disney has put me in an existential crisis. What could my life had been like had I known the truth? I am now what DeSantis fears.. woke."

Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Because they lack any of the neotenic features that usually accompany children's animation and character design in general.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"The art direction really is a head scratcher. Everything is dark, murky, and flat in color."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"I know it’s not realistic but I really wish they would have cranked up the red for Ariel’s hair. As gorgeous as Halle Bailey is, the hair needs some vibrancy."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"It's astonishing that the color grading *deliberately* went for that look. Doesn't seem to be an on-set lighting issue (Bojan Bazelli is an excellent and very versatile cinematographer), they just... digitally drained the images of life. On purpose. On a remake of The Little Mermaid, of all fucking things."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',I had the same thought. It looks like a Synderverse DC movie. I don't get it.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Tbf avatar 2 is an incredibly high bar as it's one of the most gorgeous looking movies, but yeah. It looks very dull."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Oh man it's brutally bad.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"> dead and colorless

Thats the art direction for all disney remakes. Absolutely soulless."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Not the cultural erasure, but the lack of color?  I thought leopardsatemyface folks were more progressive 😔"
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',The 90%+ dislike ratio on the last trailer means you're probably not the only one unhappy about that.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Because the scenes are happening at night time
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Sounds like the LADRCU (Live Action Disney Remake Cinematic Universe) to me
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Damn she looks good, would never guess she's 56 years old!"
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Every. Time.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"O good, I thought I was the only one."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Didnt even realize it wasnt until you said something
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"He literally just looks like a crab, are you afraid of crabs?"
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"I'm gonna be honest, it's original Sebastian that was nightmare fuel. His entire head had no chitin on it, like it was just raw exposed muscle. And he had *teeth*. He could even retract his head into his shell, becoming the shape of a regular crab, implying that he *is* a regular crab whose mouth and eyes are doing some kind of a facial prolapse.

This thing, on the other hand, looks more or less like a crab. It's got some anthropomorphization going on what with the shell being shaped like there's lips and cheeks but if I saw one in real life I'd think it was kinda cute instead of vomiting on it."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',How is a normal crab nightmare fuel?
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',He's still cute in the clip released tbh
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"I always thought Sebastian was a lobster, not a crab."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',That is pretty nuch as realistic as they can get with the fish still having emotion. Don't forget one of the bigger feedback of the lion king was a lack of emotion and too realistic. Like a dubbed nature documentary.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',This is the gritty Synder version where they show the effects of pollution bleaching the oceans.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"To be honest, Blue Planet isn’t really how shit looks. Have you ever been diving? This is what it looks like down there. Actually, often times it looks even worse. It’s not crystal clear and bright blue down there."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"No, all that fuss was before anyone had even SEEN it."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"It's been in development hell for years. Partly due to coronavirus shutting down the initial shoot, and then they (from what I heard) had their budget slashed in half. Disney will be very lucky to break even on this."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"She now apparently, voiced by awkwafina"
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Guy Ferrari would have been legendary in that role. What a waste.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"If Disney had any real guts, they’d have cast Harvey Fierstein as Ursula."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"> a character inspired by Divine?

Huh. TIL Ursula was inspired by John Waters."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Melissa McCarthy used to perform in drag as Miss Y in NYC. She even performed at Wigstock. Here’s a [link if you’re interested!](https://www.queerty.com/melissa-mccarthys-not-just-a-drag-fan-ally-she-was-also-a-drag-performer-at-wigstock-in-the-90s-20230317)
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Well you need a larger woman, for starters. And they clearly wanted some recognizable names. I don't see what's surprising"
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"My one thought was, ""How does hair loc up underwater?"""
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Disney really had a chance to cast a gay drag queen (maybe even a black one) as tha character is basically is a drag queen and decided to go with some white woman.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Simply another checkmark for the quota
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"It was inspiration, not the whole character. It was still a woman and Melissa McCarthy is great."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Normally black women are cast as strong and independent types. 

Ariel as a character was not really in that mold so knowing Disney I’m sure the goal is to beef up the character to empower women as well as play her transition in a way to specifically connect with to the trans audiences."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Black Ariel isn't even the problem if anything I'm glad they're giving Halle Bailey a shot as her singing is great. But the rest of the movie, the lighting, the effects, the ultra realistic, lifeless characters. It's all so dull and drab in an attempt to keep the budget low(er) and print Disney more cash"
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"I've heard people say ""everyone upset with black Ariel"" a hundred times but have yet to actually see anyone upset with that"
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',The trailer doesn't give much hope. It feels like they needed a name and so went with a famous larger lady regardless if it fits.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',I don’t think people are upset with black Ariel as much as they are upset that they deviated so much from the iconic Ariel from the animated version.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"People say it was because of getting the water effects right, but I say the main reason it took them this long to remake Little Mermaid was because of the Ursula casting.  Was a true “damned if you do damned if you don’t” scenario.

Like, if you cast a large woman, it’s fatphobic.  If you go the Divine route, it’s anti-LGBTQ.  If you say screw it and go a different path, fans whine about it not being “true” Ursula.  

I honestly think they did the best they could with that character, from what I’ve seen.  In terms of everything ELSE about the movie though, holy fuck.  Well, I shouldn’t be harsh, and I’ll reserve judgement till I’ve seen it.  

But considering the last Disney “live action” remake I liked was Cinderella, I have zero good feelings about this one."

Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"More like vocal minority on reddit hates it. That's why all these movies that reddit claims ""everybody"" hates make insane box office returns. Evidently, everybody doesn't hate these movies."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',I’m pretty sure this movie will be as disappointing as the previous Disney remakes. I’m also pretty sure I’ll see it in cinemas.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"You mean the highest grossing animated movie *of all time,* when it released?  I suspect they definitely learned, for better or worse…"
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Oh they learned how to make a lot of money with that movie, so they're doing the same thing and hoping it works a second time. And it will, because people are suckers and will give Disney their money"
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',They learned all they needed to when the movie made a billion dollars.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',they learned that people will see this crap no matter how bad it is.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',It made 1.663 billion USD. I think they took a lot away from that.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Disney really had her wearing her hair in scarves for like a year to hide the red, and then it's this..."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Agreed. I just wish her hair was a little brighter, because her red hair and green tail were meant to contrast. Having brown hair and blue-green tail just looks more dull."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Getting rid of redheads is a very weird but common trend in remakes.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',They actually trie but they fear that any more bleaching would cause damage too her hair (she us not jsut an actress and loc like this can take 5 years to grows) and the temporary dye was washing out in water.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Totally agree. Idk if it’s the grade or what, but the hair colour and her makeup makes her look very washed out. Everything seems muted."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"I think it looks good. Obviously red while suiting her complexion and looking natural. Fire truck red is just not a common natural color even on real redheads, it’s tricky to find OG Ariel colored dye/wig where it doesn’t look cartoonish or tacky."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Good thing it wasn’t designed for adults but for little girls instead.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Scuttle has always been an annoying character. I think the original was Buddy Hackett with that terrible New York accent. Bleh.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',I was so disappointed when I heard her voice in Raya.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',What's with the Awkwafina hate? I'm out of the loop.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Immediate pass for me as well.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Holy crap ! So the orca (sextina akuafina) from BoJack horseman was based on an actual person ? Wtf 
 Is it good that I haven't heard from it ?"
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',I thought she was a terrible choice as Sisu. She was good as Webs in The Bad Guys though.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"How awful is it that this cycle is understood now? Like, when Kenobi scapegoated racism for the reason the show was underwhelming? Or Lightyear's lack of success due to a kiss? 

They have this built in excuse to cover for the uninspired writing and bankrupt creativity when their products, once again, are culturally irrelevant."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Ass hair?
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',“YER DA SELLS AVON!   Now go get an Irn BRU so we can watch Still Game!!”
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Which ones?

Awkwafina is annoying as fuck, but the others are all pretty good

Or are you one of those ""FISH LADY SHOULD BE WHITE"" morons?"
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"As a girl I honestly find eric underwhelming,"
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"*respectfully* disagree. 

My unpopular opinions: I’m warming up to the new Sebastian. Looks kind of cute the more I look at him. Prince Eric, while nice looking, lacks the “hot” factor.

I actually really like their casting for Ariel, as long as she can act well (haven’t seen her previous work)."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Is this a sarcastic joke? I'm of Danish descent, and I'm trying to figure out why this would be offensive. Because it didn't stick to the book? The previous Disney animated version didn't. They changed the characters' basic features? Miyazaki did that with Ponyo. Because it's probably not great? The circus version already was. Not enough parkour and interdimensional aliens? Bubble has you covered, at least."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',You’ll survive
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',in recent years adults are almost always used to play teen roles. she’s only 23 so out of all the casted live action princesses so far she’s the youngest one. Jasmin is a teenager too but Naomi Scott was 26 when Aladdin came out
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',She was still a teenager when she filmed it.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Do you need to check the last name closely? I did...

This actress is only 23"
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Hopefully they aged her up.

Rewatching the original with my kids and realizing she meets the prince and gets married at 16 has me feeling MAJOR ick."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Yeah, I am honestly looking forward to the soundtrack, though not the movie itself. It's also got original songs with lyrics by Lin-Manuel Miranda and music by Alan Menken, which is a pairing I've wanted to see happen for a while."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',I heard her full version of “Part of Your World” released today. That voice. Wow.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',I’m glad they cast someone who can actually sing. Emma Watson was struggling as Belle.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',I don’t find Halle’s voice to be that good tbh
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Dude was basically just Guy in White Shirt in the animated version iirc, right?"
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',His trident looks blunt and moldy.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',I remember when everyone was saying that about Aladdin.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"This movie is going to do well, but maybe not as well as Beauty, Lion King or Aladdin"
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Flop creatively speaking ? I couldn't agree more. 

Flop economically speaking ? I think you underestimate the power of parents, grandparents, uncles, aunts taking their whole families to the cinema theater to see a family-friendly Disney movie that has a familiar story. 


I hate those remakes (except Cinderella, that one has a special place in my heart) but... what can we do ?"
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',[deleted]
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',I heard pre-sales for Little Mermaid appear to be strong. Aladdin all over again.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"It's a fish-out-of-water story, of course it'll flop."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"I wouldn’t make any sure bets either way. It’s certainly *possible* that Disney-remake fatigue has finally set in, but on the other hand, Disney nostalgia is a pretty powerful force. As is parents just taking their kids to see a movie appropriate for them, critical success be damned."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"There is a theory going around that everything is desaturated in the water because Ariel finds it all so dull

And when she goes to the land, everything will be bright and exciting"

Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Plz no :(
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"You can’t deny that this is just stupid though and screams diversity quota. If they actually wanted to have a black princess, Princess and the Frog would’ve been MILES better to adapt. Such a better movie to go off of too."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"It is the hair I don't understand. As far as characters go, Ariel's hair is pretty iconic. It is the desire to go hyper realistic that spoils these films. While I feel like it is a mistake casting Merissa McCarthy as Ursula, she at least has the iconic look (weirdly I thought that would work going hyper realistic)"
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',I guess the only winning move is simply not to play.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Two reasons for popcorn!
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Especially since there’s century old evidence that the “Little Mermaid” is actually brown.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',what….
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Apparently it did, at over $1.6 billion in revenue."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',You mean the Lion King that made over a billion dollars?
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"I wonder whether you actually want to know why, or just want to act indignant."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Considering that mermaids only live in the deepest parts of the Mariana Trench, I don't think Disney is too concerned about realism.

They'll learn their lesson when nature-savy kids are leaving the theater crying and red-faced parents are screaming for refunds."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"""this movie about mermaids isn't realistic enough, that bird doesn't live where the movie takes place!"""
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Eh, broadly probably pretty close.  Dutch West Indies would’ve been my guess for a good age of sail setting."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Melissa McCarthy is on it.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',I saw a picture of them standing together and people were saying she looked liked his kid on her first visit to the beach.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',the way you got downvoted for being excited for a disney movie is crazy lol
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Not surprised at all that you're being downvoted.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Cultural appropriation.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Oh you know why they're pissed lol
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',I find it hilarious. they are seriously underestimating this movie. It’s so interesting that anyone in these comment section say anything positive at all about the movie they’re downvoted.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"I agree, the actress has a cute baby face and a nice voice. I really dislike how it's difficult to talk about actual merits or issues with a film/TV show nowadays. Just endless boooring (and yea racist) manufactured outrage about casting."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',[removed]
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"McCarthy use to do drag and she impersonate the drag queen that Ursula was inspired by, she will do fine. I do wish they would stop with the realistic animals and just make them a bit cartoony."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"This is your favorite movie as a child, perhaps it is time for it to be another child's favorite movie.

A new version does not negate your version."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',And not Sebastian?
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',[removed]
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"It's all heavy animation still, but again Disney is just going with the really weird choice of highly-photo realistic designs for their non-human characters. It just doesn't work very well.

 You're trying to get a fish to emote like a human while looking exactly like a fish, without any embellishment on facial features. Unless they do something really clever with the kinematics it is unfortunately going to be a really flat performance for the characters."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',You mean your fish don't talk to you?
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Ehh it's probably because we're coming from an animated film.

Plenty of movies with talking animals work."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Disney doesn't care how stupid this looks if suckers still line up to watch it in theaters. If the lion king can make $1.6 billion then this will print easy money and until they stop printing money these lazy remakes will continue
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Its not that bad in motion in the trailer. But obliviously a realistic fish talking is going to look weird. No real way around that.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Are we going to successfully bully them like Sonic?
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',He looks like food.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Disney learned from Lion King that these movies make billions and are a guaranteed box office success.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Why would anyone want their animal that SPEAKS ENGLISH to look realistic?
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"> All the posters just show Disney didn't learn from Lion King 

Didn't learn what? How to make money? Disney made $1.6 billion on TLK remake. They know audiences won't give a fuck and will be lining up to watch this slop, and it will gross another easy billion for Disney. They don't need to ""learn"" anything when the winning formula to make lots and lots of money is so simple (creativity be darned)"

Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"It's crazy how much more expressive the ""cartoony"" ones are. I have no idea what emotions the photorealistic characters are supposed to be conveying."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"This looks far worse than the original remake, but to each it’s own… if I wanted to see the OG designs I’ll just watch the original animated movie…"
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',It wouldn’t have looked that bad if they could have just animated the faces to look like they were emoting.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Have you seen YMS 's vids on Lion King? ""your movie sucks"".

This dude has a PhD in everything Lion king related.

If they ever make anything Lion King Related.. They need To hire him om. Board.

Including kimba The white lion.

Dude has horus worth of vids analysing lion king and kimba."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Personally I think that's a little too cartoonish to look cohesive in a film aiming for a near-photorealistic aesthetic. I think something more akin to [this concept art for the 2019 Lion King movie](https://www.deviantart.com/michaelkutsche/art/The-Lion-King-Scar-Character-Design-806972678) would fit the style a lot better. Strikes the perfect balance between realism and the animated charm of the original character designs.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Nah, that looks worse. Going all the way with the realism looks better than some weird in-between."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',For something that they probably put together on a fraction of a fraction and with less time that still looks better.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"That's good if they wanted to make them cartoony.

They don't."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"The “fixed” version is frankly distressing and gross. It also destroys the point of a “live action remake” and instead just kicks aside hand-drawn animation for computer, which is far, far more insulting.

Thanks, I appreciate what we got more now. It could’ve been this nightmare fuel."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Why do I have a feeling that if they went this route, I wouldn’t be rolling my eyes every time I see them they and pull off a live action classic?"
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Sonics redesign was perfect for that realistic/cartoon look. Not sure why Disney can't do the same
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',pokemon movie did it well too right?
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Wow…that dude fixed my childhood with AI…
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',The only Disney live-action remake I've enjoyed so far was the Cinderella one. Mainly because they didn't copy the original story/music beat for beat.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',">If the whole point of the remake is to make it ""live-action"" they're hemmed in. 

Live-Action Mulan disagrees.

Oh...wait...you were looking for a good example...

Never mind.  I withdraw my argument."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',The Jungle Book was an enjoyable film. Though the musical number from Walkin was probably the worst part.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',The problem is that Jungle Book invalidates your comment
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',I'm sad my boy Krakatoa is probably not appearing in Moana because if he looks like an elden ring crab i will be depressed
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',And Flounder is a [sergeant major fish](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergeant_major_(fish)) which is found in the Atlantic/Caribbean. No real overlap in there ranges.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Not quite. Scuttle is a [Gannet](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_gannet) which are closely related to boobies.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',So Disney went with ultra-realism...except for the part where they misplace a species.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Why is it that Scuttle's poster kinda works, but the other two don't? Is it the eyes?"
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',But flounder literally says “there was this seagull” which outs Ariel to king triton. So why not use a seagull?
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"> Best thing is don't make them talk. 

Gritty reboot time, where Ariel is insane, pretending the fish talk to her and demanding a crab conduct the orchestra."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',">Just make the her like she is talking to herself when she is communicating and responding to the sea creatures who are making bubble noises is more than enough.

Like Sven and Kristoff in Frozen? Not sure that would work with 3 supporting animal characters. How would they talk to each other?"
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Jungle Book proves you comment false
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Even the live action Tom and Jerry (2021) made every single in-universe animal into a 2.5D hand-drawn animation
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',She's a fictional character they can do whatever. She looks great in the role. The animal characters not so much.

Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"At this point this shit look is so common for rushed, soulless executive meddling-filled studio projects, that I suspect they do it intentionally to hide the poor compositing and rushed effects. 20-year-old CGI generally looks better than the biggest movies today."

Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',I have to agree. His face was a giant lip.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',This makes some sense and your explanation is terrifying. I think you’re applying logic to cartoon character designs though. I’d bet we could apply this same analysts to other Disney characters to hilarious effect.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Basically they made him a crab crossed with a turtle.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Jungle Book disproves this though
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',But it's about mermaids and talking animals so I feel like they don't have to use realism in the settings.

Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"I was a bit sad when Ursula’s actress was announced; I had hoped a live action reboot would launch at a time where a male drag queen would be allowed in a Disney film to honor the iconic Divine.

for worse. Definitely worse."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"It still shocks me that people went to see that movie in their droves.

I know, it's some crap to sit the kids in front of for a few hours, but like... was there *nothing else* on in the cinema that week?"
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',It was the highest grossing animated movie of all time because of the music and nostalgia. It was always going to be a commercial success. The photo-realistic animation for singing animals was widely criticised though. Looks like they've done it here too.

Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Oh I assumed this was a wig, tbh. I guess it makes sense, but I'm not sure they needed to bleach further - just use a more intense red after the bleach was finished."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"I wouldn't really say that I'd prefer firetruck red anyway. But this doesn't really look red to me at all.

Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"I don’t really remember anyone from Kenobi saying the criticism of the show was because of racism? I don’t think anyone from the show actually commented on reviews, critic or otherwise as both were quite average.  

There were genuinely tons of people commenting racist things about Reva’s actress among the tone of people who actually didn’t like it. You really just had to go to YouTube or instagram to see

Same for lightyear. I never saw an executive blaming the kiss as to why the movie wasn’t successful. If anything I saw more people say “it wasn’t Toy Story enough” (equally dumb reasoning) as to why it failed. 

I see this “Disney uses this as an excuse when their movies flop” but I’ve literally never seen an actual executive on one of these remakes say that"
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"What a hot take that you can scapegoat racism.  I think you need to reflect a little, friend."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Seems like there's another cycle, though: Casting is announced and the usual types make statements of varying defensibility, many outright racist. There are pieces written about the racist hate online the star has been getting, and anti-""woke"" rants from some internet radio guy that make the rounds, clearly contextualizing the casting as a threat to their culture. Maybe a producer talks for a second about that harassment or makes some general reference to not worrying about the opinions of ""that sector.""

Then the people who said that shit point to those pieces and statements as the reason they were mad in the first place, and try to rope other people in because ""they're calling all of you racist!""

None of the culture war BS deserved over a remake that looks mediocre AF. But if we think the Right doesn't consider racial equity a threat, we're ignoring them completely."

Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Nah, I actually kinda like the Sebastian design. The shape of the shell makes him look like he has these huge bags under his eyes and big jowls, so he has a kind of ""exhausted old man"" vibe that suits him. Though obviously how well it works depends on how hard they lean into that during the movie, and how he looks while he's moving."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Someone on the design team saw the animated film and instead of realizing that Sebastian is obviously a Hermit Crab, just thought “oh that’s not what the crabs at my local aquarium look like, I’ll fix that!”

Sighhh"
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',I'm not sure how Sebastian is supposed to emote looking like that. Hell how are we even supposed to tell the voice is coming from that thing?

Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',It's the same problem The Lion King had. Aslan in Narnia emoted just fine 15 years earlier.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',What we need is hi-def remakes of classics that retains the classic animation look and feel with higher frame rate and more pixels and colors. Something like Paperman (except the color part). Not these live-action remakes.

Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Sonic was not a guaranteed hit and the bad reception to the ugly design made shareholders nervous so they forced a redesign. The Little Mermaid is a guaranteed hit, whether it's good or not. Printing money is what Disney does"
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"There's no way Disney would back down because they don't care, they know they'll make a few hundred truckloads of money on this movie even if it is hot garbage. Paramount couldn't afford to have such hubris when they made Sonic and I'm sure they were genuinely concerned the movie would flop if they didn't change it."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Not guaranteed at all. The more recent remakes are flops and this Mermaid movie has been in the works for 4 years, only just releasing now, it ain't gonna be good. They can't cancel it though cause they spent so much money on it already."

Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Plenty of people must like the realistic look or it would not have made so much money after people saw the trailers.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Well yeah if I wanted to watch the Lion King I'd just watch the Lion King. The remake just doesn't need to exist either way. I think the main problem with the current look is that the lions are indistinguishable from one another.

Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Man I wish that movie had been good, because it's exactly what I would want out of these remakes. I want the stories to be told differently and not bother redoing stuff from the animated movies. I was *glad* it wasn't a musical, and I was glad Mushu was gone. I just wish what we got was better. I wish this new movie would just take a totally different direction than the animated one, but it seems like it's going to mostly follow the old script unfortunately.

At least the villain movies (Maleficent and Cruella) have been good."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',And none of that shit is near Denmark.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',I know it’s a fantasy movie but I wish they had done a little more research on the fish and wildlife. They should at least be consistent to one region.

Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Is the bird just chilling underwater?
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',">I've heard that maybe they are afraid that no adults are gonna give the movie a try if the colors are super vibrant and lively

That does indeed sound like the kind of stupid surface-level logic that a studio executive would confuse with insightful analysis and then impose upon the filmmakers. ""Let's make it darker and drain out the colors, I'm sure this will convince adults ashamed of their inner child to go watch a movie called The Little Mermaid.""

>Because honestly yeah, lots of modern ""adult/mature"" cinema (and even videogames) feel like you are inside a goddamed cave

Indeed. And you know what's funny? That style never wins the best cinematography oscar. Dune is probably the closest it ever got, and even Dune is careful with it (Greig Fraser is one of the few cinematographers who can pull it off properly, though even he overdid it on The Batman). Roger Deakins doesn't use it. Emmanuel Lubezki doesn't use it. Robert Richardson would rather die than use it. And yet, that extremely dark look persists."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',This is BS since Alice in Wonderland made a billion dollars
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Weird thing is, in The Little Mermaid's case it's not hiding the compositing, it's making it *more obvious*. I'm not exaggerating when I say that the saturation of the image is often lower than Saving Private Ryan. I'm serious, I checked it on a fucking vectorscope. Saving Private Ryan, a movie that was *deliberately desaturated in post with a bleach bypass*, has a higher level of saturation than several shots in a live-action remake of The Little Mermaid.

But what's worse is that the saturation levels are not consistent in the compositing. The protagonist's contrast curves and saturation absolutely do not match the background in [this shot](https://youtu.be/kpGo2_d3oYE?t=98). The vividness of the blue is completely isolated in comparison to every other color, particularly the protagonist's colors. She doesn't look like she belongs. The muted highlights on her hair are particularly atrocious.

To make matters somehow even worse, when looked at on a waveform, the brightness of that shot - which is sunlit on a bright day - barely makes it to 60 IRE. In case you don't know, the scale goes from 0 (completely black) to 100 (completely white). 60 is where that *sunlit* scene tops out even at its brightest spots. [This fucking night scene](https://youtu.be/opDlMeqRACI?t=32) in Blade Runner 2049 is brighter than that, and is way more saturated, too. And the more comparable underwater shots in Avatar 2 are easily above 80 IRE, nearly 100 in some cases.

So to summarize: whoever decided that The Little Mermaid should look like that is doing this for absolutely *no benefit and no reason whatsoever*. It's genuinely baffling and gives me an existential crisis.

EDIT: And to clarify, I talked about IRE in really simplistic terms, it gets more complicated than that, but for comparison's sake it was enough. I can already picture some color grader reading this and understandably frothing at the mouth at the lack of nuance."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Speaking as someone who does this for a living: the color grading looks incredibly artificial and nonsensical. Even when she's on a rock above sea level and under direct sunlight, the saturation is *absurdly* low and the highlights are visibly dimmed. In some of the brighter sunlit scenes underwater, the saturation in the blues is *much* higher than in other colors, so the water looks vivid while the protagonist is clearly dulled, and that makes the digital composite much more obvious. The contrast curves are horrific across the board and the dynamic range of the images is severely underutilized.

This isn't an impression, I've checked the images on a waveform and a vectorscope. The contrast and the colors aren't even *close* to how the human eye would perceive them in real life. The saturation levels are around the same as Saving Private Ryan, a movie that was deliberately desaturated with a bleach bypass on the negative."

Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Sebastian seems to show some emotion. Probably the most emotive sea creature of the film.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"He’s not a hermit crab. Hermit crabs get their name from the shells they inhabit, which they change out as they grow. They borrow these shells from other species, making them one of the most distinctive crabs out there. They’re also mostly quite small, maxing out at four inches, while Sebastian is a bit bigger than the size of a human hand. Outside of their shells, their body is actually spiral shaped.


https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermit_crab



Sebastian is a cartoon crab, so a bit amorphous to begin with. He’s likely just a general idea of “crab”. Even the crab emoji 🦀 gets across what we see as the definitive crab “shape”, which he adheres to. His shell is attached to his body, is flat and red and vaguely heart-shaped, and he has thin legs compared to large claws. Completely unlike hermit crabs. He does resemble a Christmas Island Crab, or an Atlantic Deep-Sea Crab.  The problem with the first is that is terrestrial, and the second is mostly aquatic, and both tend to grow very large. 

The crab they chose for the LA, the Ghost Crab seems like a good choice, being red, big-eyed, and capable of living on land and going in the water, though apparently it can’t handle living under the water indefinitely. Still. Works visually, and is much more expressive than the other crabs."

I fear this reality and that we're already in it."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Are you referring to the Disney live-action remakes? Because that’s not true, and the box office results of the other three live-action Disney Renaissance remakes so far (Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast, and The Lion King- not counting Mulan, which ran headlong into COVID) look pretty promising for The Little Mermaid. It also supposedly has a $150M budget, which would put its break-even point at around $375M, and it would be difficult for it to miss that.

I don’t like the Disney live-action remakes either, but audiences turn out for them, especially remakes of Disney Renaissance films. This one will likely be no exception."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',doubt it reboots print money. Disney plus antman and weird wold?( can't remember) have been the biggest loses i think
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"I'm not sure that's true. Nostalgia is just a huge market right now. Quality almost doesn't matter.

Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"He was horrible. Not scary, maniacal, evil or imposing at all. I'm getting the same thing from Melissa McCarthy in this one. 

They cast for the look, over actual talent. She's talented but has none of what the original VA had and she was just a voice.

Even with her whole body, I wasn't getting a fraction of what Pat Carroll voice conveyed."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Too handsome
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Isn’t the Disney Little Mermaid set further south anyway? The houses look more Mediterranean to me. 

Apparently the LA one was filmed in Sardinia. Which is also the Mediterranean."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"At the very least, couldn’t they make Sebastian, the singing Jamaican crustacean, something besides a species of crab that can drown?"
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',I mean maybe they did their research and decided a variety of fishes /animals from different locations was what they wanted artistically
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Why? What benefit do they get from people being able to go “you know these fish actually would be found in the same region in real life”
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',You wouldn’t buy scuttle getting lost?
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',She looked so bored lol
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Yeah, I don't get it at all. Those types of comparisons (like Private Ryan) really make it seem like a joke SNL would do about some dark, gritty reboot that takes out all the joy, except it's real. These fucking billion dollar family movies come out looking like a Saw movie, and the compositing looks more and more like those old MTV Movie Award sketches where they'd splice comedians into other movies."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',*WHY DID YOU SING THAT NAME?!*
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',It's not Danish Folklore.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',">The Little Mermaid is Danish folklore.  It was never about black people.

The disney version wasn't ""about"" white people either lol. The people in it were white, but their skin colors were largely irrelevant to the plot. 

And it's absolutely hilarious that you'd try to reference the folklore, because when you read it (and you 100% have not read it yet) you'll find out that it's far different from the Disney version."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"That's a lot of words just to say ""I'm racist."""

Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',I’m not trying to date her. I just want to look at her.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Not that I am surprised. But whats the tea there?
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',What happened? I've never heard bad things about her apart from the mess of a movie Catwoman was
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Minus that part, haha"
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',yours don't?
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"They’re still animals, this is being redundant. Look at finding Nemo"
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',And half the US states from the looks of it.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Right, it's China they need to worry about. Was it Chinese libraries that schlubby Second Amendment chuds were showing up at armed to protect the kids?"
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"They ain't making no money from this, that's pretty much guaranteed."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"🙄 It was while acting in a movie. I like that subversive stuff in the name of unhinged, evocative performance art, like Ozzy Osbourne biting the head off a bat on stage.

I don’t mind Divine himself not being in a Disney film, I get it. But if Disney thinks it’s fine to reference his character heavily in an animated kids’ film just a few years after Pink Flamingos came out, I think having a live action reference to him fifty years later is fine lol."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',That is so not all Devine was as a person and performer.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Well, yeah, but I would have thought a woman doing drag means she dresses in a way that’s more associated with men. So how does that count as drag? I’m trying to learn what you mean by “drag.”"
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Exactly! Have you seen the video of him singing Poor Unfortunate Souls?  [Edit ](https://youtu.be/1mz6tw5Zddg)
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Do you think that matter to them.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',You don't need all that to have an opinion m8
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',">he thing is it looks horrible to us - but 5 year olds do not care. They just want to sing along with the (changed - don’t get me started) lyrics.

You don't need to got to the movie to do that now. Especially with the soundtrack available on YouTube."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"I'm speaking strictly from an artistic standpoint, not a monetary one. Photo-realistic animals singing looked weird in the Lion King, and the reviews mentioned that. I was just hoping that might have tried something a little different this time."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Aside from the very opening shot of the sunrise, the entire Lion King remake was animated. So no, it’s not live action."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',DERP
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',I actually don't know what she looks like. I just know Kendrick Lamar thinks she's hot and that I think she was big in the 90s.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Yes, it is. The definition of the “flop” is a movie that is a failure. Of course you can associate the box office, but thats separate. A movie can be a flop and make a billion in box office. In this case im talking just about the quality of the movie. I dont doubt that this is going to make a lot of money cause obviously a lot of families will go watch it."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Thanks man. People are downvoting me for saying that a flop and a box office flop are two different things though 😂 which is a fact and a flop is used universally in the movie industey to describe a bad movie in terms of its production value. Usually in terms of box office people use the term box office bomb or box office flop. But its not wrong to say that a movie is going to flop (despite making billions). But oh well, these internet trolls know everything."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Yes, and in terms of general audience opinion about the movie. From what I saw from the trailer, it looks like another bad live action from disney. This is just my opinion though."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"I'm not sure why you're asking me random questions? I'm talking specifically about something *you* said. So I'll ask again?

What specifically were you referring to? Are you saying white people weren't allowed to audition for Ariel?"
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Duh. It isn't out yet. Disney clearly has good reason to believe it will, though."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',I don't understand your point?
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Animated Sebastian looks way more like a hermit crab than any of those other crabs, due to their huge wide bodies. Sebastian has a small, thinner, longer physique, and has a head more distinctively not a part of his body. [Hermit crab](https://a-z-animals.com/media/2022/02/shutterstock_1820647019-1024x535.jpg)! Or at least inspired by them."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Thats what they were saying.

A better phrasing would be “That’s the same problem The Lion King had, yet Aslan in Chronicles of Narnia emoted just fine 15 years earlier”"
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"It wasn't a slip. I was literally sayign they made Aslan in Narnia emote just fine 15 years earlier, and for some reason didn't do the same with TLK."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',I was thinking more in terms of the Spider-verse style
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Netflix did that with the first Pokémon movie. 

https://m.imdb.com/title/tt0190641/

https://www.netflix.com/title/81223075"
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Eh people enjoyed them
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"I think this will perform even better than the first couple, just because The Little Mermaid was the first good Disney animation film in like 20 years when it came out, and the nostalgia is at peak levels even for people outside the expected demographics"
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Lightyear, strangeworld, and god.. the marvel dumpster fires."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"You are assuming the realistic cgi needs improvement, while the comment your replying to is saying general audiences prefer the realistic cgi and that it needs no improvement. 

Then you added sequels improving the look or quality when that wasn’t brought up originally."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Sure it was. Do you know how many Disney executives needed to make payments on their third yachts?
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"It’s a tech demo, that’s all"
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',B-b-buT ShArEhOlDeRs NeEdS mOnEyS!!!! $$$$$
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Nothing is necessary I guess, but that's life"
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',far too soft spoken. he should have been moustache twirling evil
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Still vastly different than the Caribbean from a wildlife perspective.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"""Unda' di' Sea!""

""Sebastian, Nooooo!"""
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"They needed a crab that was expressive, red, and somewhat amphibious as he accompanies Ariel on land. They made an excellent choice. Very cute cartoony eyes on that species, works well."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Honestly I wanted the movie to take place in South America. I want a South American princess
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',[deleted]
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',[deleted]
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Lots of little things. She was really rude to people during filming of X-Men and a couple other movies. After she got Oscar for monsters ball, she said some things that were kind of dismissive of her mom. I don't know if she's calmed down since then but she turned me right off and I'm going to guess she didn't win herself a lot of friends during these shenanigans cause her career kind of nosedived generally."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Shhh don't say anything! Now they're gonna live action style Finding Nemo!
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"So drag is the performance of *exaggerated* femininity. Or masculinity, in the case of a drag king, which is what you’ve described.  [Here’s an example of a famous female queen](https://youtu.be/PqoWD1elaQ0) Victoria Scone is a cisgendered woman who has appeared on two seasons of the drag race franchise"
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Drag is transformational performance art. There are many types of drag. It can be political or theatrical or comedic or any number of things. It’s an art form to express yourself and play with gender no matter where you land on the spectrum. I mean women aren’t getting in full drag every day when they put on makeup. I highly recommend looking into the world of women doing drag, it’s extremely diverse and gender shouldn’t limit people from getting out there and performing!"
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',They only love tradition until they don't like the tradition and burn it down.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"\> m8

Ironically, from the description alone it could be an American, Australian, or English guy."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Yet somehow it seems to be a pretty strong indicator of who is going to have a strong negative opinion about Ariel being Black, ""m8."""
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',By that logic Avatar 2 is an animated cartoon movie as well
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"I’m sorry, but that’s just not what the term means when describing movies. It is specifically tied to box office performance, a film is a considered a flop if it fails to break even by a significant margin. The dictionary.com definition will not be of use to you here, as that is not referring to its use in the industry."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',I don’t know if they were or weren’t. They obviously weren’t chosen.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',I... just... I can't... I think he's trying to claim that because the statue is brown the character is brown? Which might be the weirdest take I've seen ever during any element of discussion of this topic.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Try reading it in context of the post I replied to.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Not at all. Look at the pictures of hermit crabs on that Wikipedia article. There’s no resemblance. Yes, he pulls his head into his shell, but not his claws. And his shell is a crab shell, not a borrowed spiral shell from another animal. His body is not spiral shaped, but flat.

In the picture you sent, that crabs legs are broad. Sebastian has tiny thin legs. It withdraws its whole body into its borrowed shell. Sebastian cannot."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',No he doesn’t lmao he absolutely looks more like a general crab. I find it absurd you think otherwise.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Oh, apologies, for some reason I assumed you were talking about the Lion King animated film. From the stills Aslan does look better, a nice medium between realistic but with humanising aspects"
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',And many people did not. The lion king remake was artistically bankrupt and nowhere near as acclaimed as the original. Just a cash grab based on nostalgia.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',It is logical. The second one's jacuzzi just didn't have enough room for the fourth escort he wanted to stick in there... so here we are.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Isn’t Atlantica supposed to be a hub of oceanic culture that all species travel to? The god of the sea lives there.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Maybe he’s dead? He is a ghost crab
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"She’s from the sea lol, she’d be Atlantean or something"
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Nah, you're not saying that at all. The animated version erased a ton of the ""cultural story"" you're referring to as well. You'd know that if you read the actual story. But you haven't, because all you actually care about is the fact that Ariel is black."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',[deleted]
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"No one said Lion King 2019 was a cartoon, just that it was animated. As in animators used key frames to animate the characters’ movements by hand. It couldn’t possibly be live action, unless you know any highly intelligent and fully cognizant savannah wildlife that can also sing and impersonate A-list celebrities’ voices.

Avatar was created using performance capture. Which is not animation, but in fact a performance done by humans that is captured and then rendered in the computer. And definitely not animated."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Most of the actors in Avatar were heavily motion-captured.  But there were some animated elements, sure, but no cartoons.  I don’t think they had any actual singing lions doing the performance work in the recent Lion King, but I could be wrong?"
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"I see what you are saying. In a conversation it happened multiple times to be talking with people and saying a movie is going to flop (and they dont mean in terms of box office). When I mean in terms of box office I usually use the term box office bomb or box office flop. A great movie can be a box office flop. Meaning that the movie didnt make as much as expected but it can still be a great movie. When Im talking simply about the overall quality of a movie (not considering its box office) I use the term flop to describe a movie that is bad. And lots of people do. I have been participating in many oral movie debates and usually thats how we say it. Maybe because there is not a specific term to differenciate. So when I said this movie was going to flop, im specifically saying its going to flop in terms of its bad quality. I have also checked many websites about movies and thats exactly what it says. The meaning of a movie flop is that the movie is not good. And than theres the box office flop. Two completely different things. But maybe the term flop is not the best to describe a bad movie. Thats not up to me though."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',">I don’t know

Alright so then your previous statement was pulled out of your ass.

>You can’t deny that this is just stupid though and screams diversity quota"
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"So, isn’t my “take” the more legitimate argument? Frankly I think my has more validity than yahoos with their knickers in a bunch about Bailey being cast. Do you have anything to add?"
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"No problem, I cleared up the wording in my post so it was clear I wasn't saying Aslan was in The Lion King, heh."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"It's a remake. It's not supposed to be acclaimed.

A lot of people enjoyed it, otherwise they wouldn't make so much money."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"And media is never going to please everybody. I don’t care for these live action Disney movies. So I’ve never paid to go see them. I don’t understand why others get their panties in such a bunch over them existing.

They are financial successes. There are lots of people that want to see them. Just because they don’t meet your personal criteria for what a movie should be doesn’t mean it doesn’t meet others’. They don’t need to be critically acclaimed to exist."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',[deleted]
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Dude, I think your ""take"" is something you came up with while stoned off your ass."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',">It's a remake. It's not supposed to be acclaimed.

Then why make it. You’re literally proving my point. It’s a cash grab based on nostalgia, there was no artistic merit. 

>A lot of people enjoyed it, otherwise they wouldn't make so much money.

This is not an argument for quality. A lot of people enjoyed the most recent transformers film. It did not make it good. And many many more people thought it was shit."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',[deleted]
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Dude, what’s your point? Are you salty because she got the part?"
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Pretty much all movies are cash grabs lmao. That's why they make movies.

Movies are meant to be enjoyed. It's like Mario. That movie is mid too but people enjoy it."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',[deleted]
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Movies are generally made to make money yes, but most have more reason to exist than “people liked the original so they’ll show up to watch it no matter how pointless or shit it is”. There’s usually some artistic merit to it. At least with Mulan, as bad a film as that was, it was very different in style and plot, there was a reason to redo it in a different way. The lion king was exactly the same but worse."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',[deleted]
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Most big blockbuster movies have the same reason ""people like X, so they'll show up"""
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',[deleted]
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',And many blockbusters aren’t particularly good cinema. The lion king was particularly egregious though.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"It’s racist because people of certain backgrounds were kept from certain roles because of their skin color. White people have no problem finding roles or having representation. 

Also Bridgerton is based mostly on fictional people. And how is it cultural appropriation when black and brown people existed back then."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Good is subjective
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Well yes, but what’s the point in any discussion on films if you reduce it to that level? 

You described the Mario film as mid earlier, that is meaningless if everything is subjective. Why should anyone care about your description of it, it may be a masterpiece to others."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Now you're understanding
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Why are you commenting if all discussion is pointless then?
