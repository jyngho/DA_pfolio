Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"800M-1B imo. GA does NOT care about VFX, they will eat this up like almost all the other live action Disney remakes."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Remember when Aladdin’s trailer came out and everyone hated how Smith’s genie looked? Yeah, Disney’s marketing for these movies looks bad to us but they end up appealing heavily to the GA."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"I want to like it, I really do. I think a lot of it actually looked really good, albeit cheesy. But I know it's just a trailer, and these trailers end up making the movie seem a lot better than it ends up being (I think of Mulan and Pinocchio which had great trailers as well). Where credit is due, the acting looks good. 

Maybe I'll go see it. The Little Mermaid and it's home video sequel and prequel were some of my favorites growing up."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',At least they made her hair brighter. I love the animated little mermaid but this movie just ain't for me. Not a terrible trailer for kids and young families though.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Is it me or does Ariel’s acting seem a little too stilted and choppy? Ursula looks pretty good though.

Overall, this should end at the higher end of Disney remake grosses, maybe a little below Aladdin."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"This looks really bad, it will make at least $800 million."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"One of the problems with having overworked VFX teams is that they have to hide the small flaws in their CGI, and one way to do that is to make everything dark. The vibrant colors of the cartoon are gone. The palette is all dreary. This does not look like a movie that would appeal to children. It looks bad."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',This movie will need to perform without the entire Asia market. Good luck.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Summer 2023 is MASSIVELY crowded. But this is probably being underpredicted. I don’t see it making $1B, but it should do well, and might give Spider-Verse some tough competition for #1 on that first weekend in June"
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',[removed]
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Halle and her singing is beautiful but other than that this is just not doing it for me
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"I think this will be the biggest wild card for 2023 box office.

For me, I’m expecting 700 million to 1 billion."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"I think the movie is gonna do well, is just not for me. I haven't even seen the original and I have no intention of it anytime now. Assuming GA likes it then it's a billion dollar film. GA loves these Disney live actions. Still salty that they had to fuck up Mulan so bad, the only film I was asking for a 1 to 1 remake and they had to fuck that one up."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Gonna remind everyone that this subreddit is usually wrong about trailers.

See Aladdin and Venom."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"I’m not seeing $1B for this because I think Disney has alienated some of their audience. However, I think it will be a lot bigger than I initially thought (I had it on par with the first Maleficent), in the $775-850M worldwide range, but it will be more domestic heavy than int’l, similar to both Black Panther movies."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"I think the movie will be good, but the visual effects are a little… cheesy? Still think this has a shot at a billion, especially if the music sounds great"
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',This movie better wishes upon a star to pull off an Aladdin upset because this is still not it.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',[removed]
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"600 ww I think, half of it from US."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',At least it looks a lot more colourful than the first trailer did.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',It was super annoying when the Oscars stopped everything to hype this trailer up
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Despite reddits vitriol, it's making a billion. Kids and families are there for the name, so as long as what they recognize from the original is here, which is the music, they will show up"
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',[removed]
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Don't get me wrong Halle Bailey has a lovely voice and can sing...but that's not Ariel and I don't think this film is going to do well at the box office.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',My 6 year niece having grown up on the cartoon watched the trailer and asked …. “Mommy where’s Ariel?”
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',I don’t expect many kids under 7-8 to see this based on this trailer.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',If this has a budget over 200M then that will be truly embarrassing like JL level embarrassing because the cgi looks way too cheap to be 200M or over
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Yeah, this isn't hitting a billion."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Should do around 600 - 750 M
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',[removed]
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',I hope it flops but I doubt it will
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Really excited for this movie. I don't even know why besides the fact that I love musicals. But man can't wait to see it in theaters
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"600m ww because of the brand, but i doubt it'll be good."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',This isn’t coming close to a billion.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',This could hit $1B. The general audience is not in any way similar to redditors.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Arielle is serving so hard vocally. Worth the ticket for that, imo"
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Can y’all chill out about the VFX? Like damn you go try and do VFX and see how hard it is. Not every movie is gonna look like mf Avatar damnit…

Anyways, imma say:

$116.1M OW

$423.7M DOM

$643M OS

$1.067B WW"
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',One billion confirmed.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"The movies look more colorful than expected, but if this film is a crowdpleasing hit then Transformers and Spider-Verse should be worried they could get mixed up in the family market especially Spider-Verse as both movies have black protagonist and in somewhat targeting black families."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Halle is the only thing that interests me. I think her design is great and that tail is amazingly done. The underwater effects don’t look too bad. Can’t wait!
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Alright, consider me a frickin' believer now.  This has been happening a lot this year.  First, Flash, then Indy, and now this.  Gonna be a great year for blockbusters, and I think this one might just earn a billion worldwide.  To hell with the racists and the Disney boycotters.  This is gonna dominate."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',This movie is gonna do 1b and I sense there’s gonna be a lot of deleted comments
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"I'm giving my official prediction. This movie will not gross over 800 Million.
I honestly struggle to see it even reaching 750 Million.

This just looks like any other generic Disney live action remake with non of the colors or liveliness of the animated movie.
The visuals are okay at best.
And from the trailer atleast, Halle Bailey did not impress.(They could have gotten an actress with a tad bit more acting experience).

And before people start making accusations, I have no problem with the casting just Disney half assing these live action remakes. 

And I know people like to bring up the other Disney live action remakes that made money. But if an Alladin movie with Will Smith in 2019(Pre-Covid/Peak Disney) struggled to make a Billion dollars. 
I don't think this movie has chance in hell of making it. 

I see this movie making anywhere between 650 Million to 750 Million. 
Not a flop like some are predicting but definitely not the super success that most are predicting."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',1B is definitely on the table fs fs
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"This could be this years Lightyear.

These live remakes have been going straight  to Disney+ since the pandemic started, similar to the Pixar films and this is the first one post pandemic not going straight to Disney+, just like Lightyear was. 

I have a feeling audiences will just wait the 30-45 days for it to hit Disney+."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Will it profit?I suspect a flop but who knows
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Looks great. I hope it makes 1 B+, then another billion for all the piss-babies mad about black Ariel.

The only thing I don't like is the hyper realistic animal sidekicks. Creep me out."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"It looks like shit because Disney is handing over these movie to talentless directors. But that's pretty much irrelevant for the performance of these remakes at boxoffice 

There's no between with This movie, it is going to either be a huge hit or flop pretty badly at boxoffice 

The original little mermaid wasn't that successful, it was the worst performance out of Disney Renaissance movies at boxoffice and the story wasn't good either, so there's a very good case that it might outright bomb at boxoffice 

In the other hand, the power of nostalgia is strong and the casting might also make the movie overperform in the domestic market hence becoming a huge hit worldwide"
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Looks good, not for me though"
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"I don't know if i have enough money to watch all the things that are coming this year, this year is packed."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',It's looking much better than I expected. Another massive hit from Disney.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"I do wish Ariel's hair was more red, and the design of Sebastian doesn't look great, but I will say this trailer looks quite a bit better than the past ones."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Looks awful, pretty sure this will go straight to dvd, not even Blu-ray or streaming, like just Redbox."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',This movie is going to flop badly.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',[removed]
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',This will not do very well at the box office.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Putting aside my personal opinions, I think that this is going to make a lot of money. There's nothing in particular going against it aside from some astroturfed controversy about the race swapping. Spider-Verse 2 may steal some of TLM's thunder but I think it'll be fine if families respond well to the film. I think that Disney has a winner on their hands with this... They've certainly done worse than this and gotten stellar results (Lion King 2019)."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"All over the Internet I see this getting ratioed right now, but it’s probably going to perform above most expectations. It’s guaranteed to be among this summer’s top five global grossers, and (maybe?) if luck is on it’s side, it’ll make that top 3."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Wth? My comment was removed for being positive about the trailer? The movie looks like… The Little Mermaid. I think it’ll be fun. The trailer is solid.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"21 upvotes to 160 comments...yeah this thread isn't going to be good.

The movie looks good to me. I'll be taking my niece to see it."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Unless this movie has a banger of a score, it's going to do much much worse than the other adaptation."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Just like all the previous Disney films they are the same exact thing I don’t see the appeal. And doubt it’s gonna hit a billion.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"$800-900M. It would have likely crossed $1B before Disney+ and COVID but there are a lot of people that went to the theater to check out Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, and The Lion King that will likely wait for it to come out on Disney+."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"I will watch this it's looking good and because I watched the animated one when I was a child ,hope the story is good because Mulan story was piece of garbage"
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',[deleted]
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"don't think a lock for billion anymore, but little girls  are easy to impress"
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',[removed]
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Out of all the trailers/teasers they put out, this one is definitely the best. And Halle looks engaging. CGI is still very wonky."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"How was my topic about her CGI removed for being ""off topic"" when there's so many others commenting on the appearance too?"
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',$1.28bn mark me down
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"The movie looks bad; the vfx, the dull looking colors, and the lighting are too troublesome to overlook for most when it comes to quality. I know that kids won’t really care about all of those factors, but the lack of vibrant colors and expressive characters & animation will. This doesn’t seem exciting and captivating enough to grab a kids attention. 

Ursula looks great and it seems that Melissa really will deliver. Halle’s voice is also a stand out, but can those two potentially bring in the numbers? It’s tough to predict, but 1 billion is definitely in its grasp. 

I think once we get another trailer and we get closer to release, we will have a better judgement."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',[removed]
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',[removed]
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',That’s what I don’t get. We already went through this with Aladdin. It clearly isn’t going to flop. The 90s nostalgia is too strong.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Sebastián looks and sounds terrible.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Disney knows this. I have submitted to a future of lazy remakes because it doesn’t matter in the end, audiences will be there"
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"All other disney live action remakes that came out pre pandemic and pre disney plus launch 
This is gonna struggle hard"
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Unfortunately the GA will eat up anything which lets Disney to stay on low quality bs
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Reasons they will eat it up: Nostalgia, following the plot almost closely, has all the songs intact, and probably the big one: Halle Bailey's performance as Ariel and her magical voice. Literal chills every time the previews show her singing ""Part of Your World."""
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Phase 1 - Thousands of people angrily screaming ""Who asked for this?!""

Phase 2- it ends up making a billion dollars

Phase 3- ""Th-that doesn't make it **good!**""; ignoring the original question"
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Exactly what I was thinking. Yeah the effects are shit compared to Way of Water but so are pretty much every movie ever. I could absolutely see general audiences eating this shit up
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"This subreddit and the movies subreddit and pretty much all Reddit has a high hatred for Disney live action films.

Look at this post. It's at 50% up voted lmao...

Just saw the trailer and this looks like a solid billion dollar movie for me."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',It’s the same boring cycle. People call these movies bad looking and then they have pikachu faces when they make a good amount of profit.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Definitely. There isn’t much Disney could do to suddenly make my kids NOT want to see this.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',That was my impression as well but it is a little hard to tell with just a few lines of dialogue.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',i agree with ur point but people still flocked to black panther and its sequel though
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',It’s 2023 and y’all still think spider verse is like avatar where it’ll be a huge threat or even competition to other movies. Come on now…
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Summer isn't that massively crowded for family films though.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Both will be big, but if it performs like Aladdin, SpiderVerse should be comfortably number 1 that weekend."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"I hope she's able to get a long career off the back of her performance, but I also hope the rest of the movie is a disaster so we stop getting these lazy remakes."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"I can understand this reaction, but it just won't matter ultimately.  People are gonna flock to it."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',But it’s a remake to an old film everyone knows. Film quality doesn’t matter with these remakes because we already know the story is good. It’s all about the visuals and music that matter.

Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Avatar cost way too much to produce. It would be financial suicide to increase the budget that much in order to make the water CGI quality the same as avatar 2
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',">but that's not Ariel

Because she's not white?"
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Interesting
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"This comment made me think about what the target demography is. It seems like a type of movie that children will find boring and adults will find too childish.

&#x200B;

It's a straight-to-tv type of movie for backround watching for me, personally."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',I can see the budget being $150 million. It would only be $200 million for the inclusion of COVID protocols.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"""Not everything does. Not everything has to."""
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',It could because disney plus is there and if wom is on the level of lion king or alladin live action audiences will skip it for streaming
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',600M is gonna be a hard pull with disney plus and the competition at hand
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"The general audience is NEVER redditors, or twitter people, or the kind of people who obsess over the number of dislikes a video gets.

We have to keep learning this lesson, the internet is not the real world."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"You're right. Not every movie has to look like Avatar.
You can also look like The Jungle Book.
I keep forgetting which studio made that movie."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Dude this movie is like 95% VFX and it probably has a budget of 200M or maybe more depending on how the covid tax affected the production we have to criticize the VFX here otherwise you'll expect more shitty looking expensive movies like this
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"I agree! We shouldn’t be that hard on TLM! After all, it’s produced by small indie company named Disney!"
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Nope. $400M WW. Will do worse than Ant-Man.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Yep. Right along the same folks who said avatar 2 would flop.

Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"There hasn't been a Renaissance remake since the pandemic began except for Mulan, and that was a 30$ premiere release. Lady and the Tramp and Pinocchio are no way similar to this, I don't think the general audience expects this to be on D+"
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',No musical remake has gone straight to Disney+. The last one that's kept the musical stuff in it was pre covid.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Lie again.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"I mean, this one has the perfect formula for a billion dollars."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"> Incoming Weirdos setting up every blockbuster to be a Billion dollar film💀

I know right lmao.

Can also say incoming simpletons trashing the movie for no good reason."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Angry neck beards are not the movie’s audience. Nobody in the real world cares about being “ratioed.”
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Angry boys online are not the movie’s audience.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',It will have the beloved songs from the original.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Alan Menken is back to do the score and every song from the original will be there, along with four new ones written by Menken and Lin-Manuel Miranda."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',But the “same exact thing” carried those previous films to a billion. Why wouldn’t this one? The formula works. Even if we don’t like it.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',But disney plus is right there and this doesn't scream must see in cinemas with the way it looks
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"This is a subreddit about box office discussion, your opinion about a girls voice is meaningless here."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',[removed]
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"According to the box office of these films, everyone."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Eh I like seeing these
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"There's a big difference between 2019's market and today.


Before the Pandemic, audiences were much more open to going to the cinemas to see any movie that was mildly entertaining.
Audiences now have become much more selective.
Also Disney had much more goodwill back then.

Marvel movies used to be sure shot super successes back then but clearly that's not the case now."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',The Lion King music and movie was a massive let down and that movie was still huge. Just from the little tease of the music we've had so far I'm going to say the music is going to be quite good. So it has that going for it.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"And so it goes, round and round."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"The effects are weird, but not shit. It outright looks like people filmed in open air as if to look like they're under water, and it results in a sort of uncanny valley/surrealist sort of vibe. That's not exactly a new quality to this property. I mean, we had the same questions of the cartoon film like ""where the f are all those bubbles coming from underwater every time someone swims around?"" It's weird, but it worked before."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"They absolutely will. This looks like complete dogshit, and the animal sidekicks are uncanny as fuck (which literally defeats the purpose of including them). But as long as families are okay with it, then it has a clear path to success"
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Oh, don't worry, they will."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Idk about this making a billion at all lol
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"I don’t get it. This film follows the same formula as BatB, TLK, and Aladdin in being almost the same thing.

That is exactly what the GA wants. 

Literally it just has to be not an outright disaster (and some would argue TLK was and look at that..) and it’ll make a ton"
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"by this point I doubt people think these movies won't make money, still look terrible though"
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Well, I've been converted.  This is gonna get a billion dollars, and I was one of the early naysayers."

Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',There are plenty of kids/teens that don't grow up with the original animated TLM.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"I never bitched about TLK so not sure what you mean about that. To me, the trailer looked distractingly cheesy, not lovably cheesy."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Hey dear, it may be shocking to hear but there's this phrase that goes ""properly executed implementation of stylization.""

TLK lacked any sort of inspired visual style.

This looks like it lacks budget.

Both are missing the point."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"The only reason people were mad about the Lion King effects is that they didn't give the animals proper expressions, because the director wanted it to be like ""a nature documentary"". Ignoring the fact that lions can emote plenty in real life and they did great with Aslan 15 years prior. All they had to do was make them like Aslan and it could have been great.

The background CGI was good, it was the character CGI that was the issue."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Nobody cares about Spiderverse and Transformers (and even The Flash I'd say).

Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Its a live action of Disney animations they typically go up to 200M and beyond  before tax rebates eg beauty and the beast, mulan, the lion king so its that far of a stretch excluding covid stuff"
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',The majority of people here are claiming that it is going simply because its another live action of their fariy tales
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',You mean aladdin and lion king which both made a billion at the box office? Those movies?
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Right. And here's some proof: the just released ""Halle Bailey as Ariel"" doll has sold out on online retailers."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',You can't be serious....
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',You can hate on it without looking like you know nothing about the box office. You chose... not to.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Yup and its worth noting that those movies pose more threat to LMM than the competition did to TLK and BATB did during their release windows
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"The only film on that list that is competition is indiana jones in June. 

In fact, its going to be hilarious to see the “beloved online fave” spiderverse get curb stomped by a mermaid. Oh the little boys, they never learn."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Actually yes. Pinocchio is a partial musical.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"do you guys forget about Nutcracker, christopher robin, Mulan etc? for every successful disney remake there are 2 others which flop"
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',The backlash from the casting on this one is gonna hurt the numbers. I don’t care either way.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"The formula barely dragged Alladin across the Billion dollar.
And that movie had Will Smith in it. And that movie was released in 2019 before the Pandemic when Disney was at it's peak.

The Little Mermaid is less popular than Alladin.
Has no big name star like Will Smith.
Is coming out post pandemic when the audiences are way more selective.
And is coming out at a time when Disney movies are very clearly not making what they did pre pandemic.

It's not going to flop but it's not going to cross the Billion dollar mark just because of the formula"
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',[deleted]
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"It's LMM, it's guaranteed to be great. He doesn't really miss lol"
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',I don’t think they’re bad it’s just everyone keeps comparing it to Way of Water because of you know water but that movie looks so good it makes almost everything else look bad in comparison
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"The same formula that made Pinocchio, Dumbo and Mulan huge hits, right?"
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',You do realize all those movies you listed was pre-pandemic and also pre-disney plus launch right? The market simply isn't the same anymore since those movies
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Spoiler. A lot of the hatred comes from people being angry that Ariel is black. Not that those people would ever admit.

This looks no worse than any other Disney live action and i have no doubt that it will play well in theaters."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Exactly. We all know that the formula works.

Even the formula for MCU works, it's just that we've gotten so much more of that compared to these musical live Action films"
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',People project their own personal preferences and confuse them for reasonable predictions. People thought Aladdin would flop because “it looked bad.” Well…
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"It has the Perfect formula for a billion dollars.

It's a Disney Musical, people LOVE Disney Musicals.

It has Disney Renessannce one at that too, bringing those who grew up with it too.

It's the first black actress to be lead a live action Disney musical, you'll get people supporting just because of that.

It's a fantasy type film, general audiences love being taken out of their real world into something fantasy.

LMM is writing new songs for it."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Usually you can tell the percentage. Look at how many upvotes the post has compared to comments.

If it has more comments then usually the thread is pretty bad...like this one."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',lmao yeah i dont see a lot of asian people excited for this film (source: i’m asian and live in asia) but this will definitely do well domestically. lots of black americans and left leaning people who want to see diversity are excited to see it
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Elemental coming out the same day as Flash 💀
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"I'm talking family films though.

Next one would be Elemental.

Spider-verse and Transformers are more niche now with the respective fandom.

Flash will be good competition but if you're bringing your kids, you'll take them to see TLM or Elemental instead, same with Indiana Jones"
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"I think the only movie that will unseed Mermaid is The Flash.

Spider verse is niche and so is Transformers...well that IP was kinda killed by Michael Bay."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Aladdin made $42 million in weekend 2 domestically, I'd be shocked if SpiderVerse opened below $50 million."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid', But their parents did
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Born in 1999, never watched The Little Mermaid, and I don’t really plan to in the future lol"
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"It's supposed to look that cheesy!!

Maybe you don't see it but I definitely do.

It's just supposed to be a fun musical live action film."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Lmao if it looked like it didn't lack budget, yall would bitch about something else."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Aslan wasn't really emoting like real lions. They don't do that in real life.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Spiderverse made 400M and has only gotten more popular since it made it online. 

To say no one cares is plain wrong. 

People care for transformers. Make it a good movie and people will easily watch it. 

Spiderverse easily seems like another 400M + grosser

Transformer can easily make over 500M if it’s good. That’s good competition.

And come on dude. Even if the flash movie was the worst movie ever, it will easily make 400M especially with the hype of 2 Batman + super girl and then flash.  If the movie is really good, it can easily make 700-800M +"
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',You have to be living under a rock to say no one cares about spider-verse 💀
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Just personal experience as a parent who watch children movies with my kids, I have a grasp of the quality of Disney live-action movies. Here, I'll make a list for visual aid of live-action disney movies neither me or my children enjoy.

&#x200B;

CINDERELLA (2015), MULAN (2020), BEAUTY AND THE BEAST (2017), ALADDIN (2019), MALEFICENT (2014), THE LION KING (2019), ALICE IN WONDERLAND (2010), DUMBO (2019), ALICE THROUGH THE LOOKING GLASS (2016), PINOCCHIO (2022).

&#x200B;

Now there is one exception. THE JUNGLE BOOK (2016). Even if I don't enjoy a children movie, sitting with my children who does makes me able to watch through it.  

And I specifically only mean the live-action Disney movies here, we still re-watch the classic and newer animated movies quite regularly.

To sum it all up: Have you seen the Aladdin live-action??"
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Ya those movies which came out before disney plus launched and before the pandemic
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Buh buh buh neckbeards disliked a video!
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',100%
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"You’re right. I have no clue what I’m talking about: https://www.reddit.com/r/boxoffice/comments/114rfsr/after_huge_175m_thu_previews_at_us_boxoffice/j8yipy0/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3

And I’ll admit, I’m mostly exaggerating. It’ll do better than that, but truly I don’t believe it’ll finish much better than $600M WW.

My actual prediction would be $550M-$610M. Zero way this thing hits a billion. Especially with actual competition this Spring/Summer."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Barely. It's not labeled musical..
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Mulan didn’t even release in the US, and came out on Disney+. The Nutcracker isn’t a remake, and neither is Christopher Robin."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"The Nutcracker never was a 2D Disney Rennaisance musical, Christopher Robin was a sequel more than a direct adaptation, and Mulan was more like a take on the ballad than an adaptation of the Disney version people actually liked and were hoping for."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Im suprised you remember the nutcracker tbh
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Backlash is vocal minority.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',No it isn't. It's absolutely free marketing.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Fine but you’re still wrong that no one wants to see these movies.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',No reason to call people idiots for something so innocuous.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Dumbo was quite different from the original, Pinocchio released straight to Disney+, and Mulan didn’t get a proper release because it was supposed to come out in March 2020 (you know when the pandemic started). Also, Dumbo and Pinocchio were not renaissance movies.

Bad examples."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',None of those are musicals so they literally don't fit the formula.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',The only live-action adaptation to come out in theaters since the start of the pandemic was Cruella which did well for it’s circumstances.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Yeah the look of it reminds me of aladdin live action. 

The real issue with this movie is that the original little mermaid wasn't that successful to begin with, it's the lowest grossing of Disney Renaissance and it's not going to play well in some regions because of the casting 

Either way I'm very curious to see how this one will perform at boxoffice"
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"And guess who's directing it: Rob Marshall, who is no stranger to the billion dollar club with the fourth Pirates of the Caribbean film. And this is his third movie musical for Disney after Into the Woods and Mary Poppins Returns."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Transformer is a family movie. As long as it is good, the movie is a competition"
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"all of them are family movies, Superhero movies aside from R-rated and something like batman are geared towards families, so is transformers, elementals, Indy, spiderverse and Fast X which debuts a week or two before"
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Calling a Spider-Man film, even one without Peter Parker as the main star niche is a bit off"
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"The original opened 35M

I’d say the same or 38M."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"I'm born in 1993, never watched any of the Disney films besides Hercules.

I'm a fan of musicals in theaters so I'll always watch these."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Sebastian is terrible.  I didn't even realize it was supposed to be him right away because the damn fake creepy crab didn't look like it was talking.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Ignoring everything said in a comment that you responded to just makes everyone believe you're trolling.

I _just_ said that there's an alternative way of handling their film production."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"They don't emote to that degree, no, but they emote more than they did in the Lion King film."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',What? Cinderella? That movie was the best live action Disney film to date. I saw it whilst at Uni and absolutely loved it.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Ah, the new excuse."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Bro I'll take what you're having... I mean I'm not saying it's not impossible but it's like 99% not possible.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"1) I dont understand what that ant man 3 prediction has to do with this if im being honest, youre going to have to make the connection for me, im sorry.

2) i think thats far too low. The other live action remakes have made bank and 1b, so id assume that would have been the data point used. Not ant man 3 ? Youll want to compare it to similar movies/genre. Ant man 3 isnt as close as, say aladdin, BATB, TLk, etc."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',well see at the box office when it releases. like i said i could care less since i aint even watching it but i am interested how it performs. My prediction its not gonna get 1B WW. DOM 450M
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"I said no one asked for it, not that no one would see it."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Right. Mulan didn't even have Mushu
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',And if anything Mulan was more an adaptation of the original ballad and less an adaption of the Disney film.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',cruella didn't have the competition that little mermaid is going up against so thats a big factor to look out for
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',People tend to forget that The Little Mermaid was the first movie in the Disney Renaissance. While i don't doubt that its not as popular as some of the other IP's it was also the first to test the waters so it likely didn't play to its full potential.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Its a beast wars movie, thats niche as fuck."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',I mean is it really? You're not taking your family of 2 kids with the wife and one daughter to that over TLM.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"The first one didn't even make 400m. It's pretty niche film targeted to Spiderman animation fans, not GA."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"It was a Christmas release with a 5.4× multiplier, and exploded on home video and streaming after it won Best Animated Feature. Spider-Man and Miles himself have only become more popular since it opened. I'm not saying it'll make as much as The Little Mermaid overall, but it'll definitely open way bigger than the original opened with. It won't have a 5.4× multiplier again, but it will have a bigger opening and total gross than the original."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',It's not that terrible. Look at Charlotte's Web.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',They really don't.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Its not an excuse these things did not exist in summer 2019 when these films came out so now you have a huge variable for TLM box office gross where moviegoers are gonna say wait til streaming if the wom isn't good enough
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"I’m mostly exaggerating haha. My actual prediction is $550M-$610M. 

Just look at my Ant-Man prediction: https://www.reddit.com/r/boxoffice/comments/114rfsr/after_huge_175m_thu_previews_at_us_boxoffice/j8yipy0/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3"
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid'," Not every live action remake hits a Billion... Dumbo made 300M, and Alice 2 made about 280M. Along with that, Mulan, Lady and the Tramp, and Pinnochio were all poorly received on D+. I don't think TLM will bomb, but 600M seems about right"
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',No one asks for pretty much all movies though.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"If people see it its because they wanted it and thus asked for it.
Supply, demand."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',This is *The Little Mermaid* lol not some random movie like Pete’s Dragon. Come on now
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"I don't think the first to test water is as of a big hurdle to overcome in 1989 as people are making it out to be because back then originals were dominating the top 10 highest grossing list anyway and movies stayed in the theater longer 

I think the real problem is that story of the movie isn't good compared to the little king, aladdin or batb"
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Transformer the name isn’t niche.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"It’s up to the kids. If the kids want to watch transformer, the parents will take them there. The parents aren’t gonna be like you wanna watch transformers? Too bad. We are watching the little mermaid"
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Spider-Verse isn’t niche, I think you’re ignoring how successful it was during and especially after it’s theatrical run."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',let's see how the sequel does
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Spiderverse couldnt even outgross the amazing spiderman movies.
Targeting only two quadrants will always limit your box office."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Its 2023. Audiences still like what they like. Plenty of other films are making alot of money. You’re talking like its 2021.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',What's your reasoning though
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Movie isn’t even out yet… so we don’t know how many people ‘want’ to see it.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"The little mermaid is less popular than either batb, the lion king or aladdin, so other movies have much better odds to make money going up against the little mermaid 

The original little mermaid was the lowest grossing of Disney Renaissance."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',And disney plus exists so if the reception isn't steller enough to carry then expect little BO returns
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"It's not that. TLM came first. It's literally the only reason.

It was a critically acclaimed film."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Let's be honest if you have one girl, one boy, with the wife, TLM is getting chosen."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Dude spiderverse is niche. Get out of your online bubble.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Quantumania says otherwise
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Well, all these live action versions make about a billion. It’s a safe bet. But you know better, random internet person?"
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',">The original little mermaid was the lowest grossing of Disney Renaissance.

That's partially because it was the first film in the lineup."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Lmao it did the lowest because it came out first........
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',It making less around 30 or so years ago than the others is irrelevant. It’s 2023 and it’s solidified itself as an iconic piece of film with just as much as a cultural impact as Lion king and Aladdin. I don’t get this narrative.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"I fail to see why coming first would have been such a huge problem in 1986 when most movies were originals anyway, no streaming at the time so movies stayed longer in the theater"
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',what are you being honest about? We don't know shit about what goes on in mind of families when they pick up movies.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Its 2023, boys can like dolls and girls cars"
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Everyone I know online and in real life are excited for spider-verse. The trailer has 31M views and 900k likes, what kind of people do you talk to?"
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"“Eternals says otherwise”
Then the next three MCU movies are in the top ten highest grossing films of 2023.

I mean, thats like declaring the MCU dead after thor the dark world."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Because anything that comes first is usually always going to make less than after.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"TLM has something for everyone, which is my point."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"No shit. 

But TLM has action, princesses, dance, evil villians, etc you'll have something for everyone."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"“Everyone i know.”
Well who could argue with all that polling data?

I’m using the first film’s meh box office as proof."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Thor 2 was a massive hit that did significantly more than Thor 1 and boasted genuinely good contemporary user reviews across the board (all while not being very good). Coming off of Avengers 1, audiences liked Thor: Dark World because of how much they liked the first Avengers film."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"You do realize Quantumania made less than the first antman movie despite the larger opening weekend right
this isn't a dark world situation where it's just another mid sequel its actually not going to break even and some of this can't be attributed to the disney plus release where audiences just wait to see it there

People were doing this for wakanda forever, love and thunder and multiple of madness so its not a unique thing its kinda a recurring problem here"
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Fair enough, but you have to be ignoring its popularity online and elsewhere. You’re also ignoring its popularity with teenagers."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Thor the dark world is one of the worst films in the MCU. Its hated.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"And the eternals was a clear sign that wakanda forever would not make 800M.
Oh wait….

Also, multiverse of madness made like 900 million.

Clearly, the eternals spelled the end for marvel."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Its mostly popular with two quadrants. Young and old males. That will never get you on the big side of the box office.

A live action Miles film would be big."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Use the way back machine on Thor 2's IMDB or Rotten Tomatoes score. Look at the film's cinemascore. Look at the film's box office gross. 

Literally all of the data shows the film was liked on release. It's always been a bad movie but an Avengers halo clouded it and the fact that it's an MCU film meant that people continue to focus on it, driving perception downwards while equally bad or worse films are forgotten about rather than reevaluated in a negative direction.

e.g. Look at this healthy [7.5/10](https://web.archive.org/web/20140209082852/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1981115/) on IMDb and look today and see a 6.8/10 average."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',Actually it was love and thunder that spelled the end
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"[TheQuorum’s current tracking of Spider-Verse indicates, 81% will pay to see it 19% will wait to stream it for free.](https://thequorum.com/pay/) Unless I’m interpreting this wrong, in that case let me know."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',And then wakanda forever bombed…oh wait…
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',I’ll be honest I dont know how to analyze that data.
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Wakanda forever had the advantage of being made for the black audiences which allowed it to reach way more people outside of the mcu fanbase no doubt it was going to make money 

Quantumania is setting up the villans for the next avengers its a main event and it's not even catching the first antmans BO thats most certainly a huge indicator that the franchise is falling apart 

Now with the main point I was making is that the disney plus release is giving people another option here to just avoid the cinema and it's likely to repeat with TLM as well"
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Honestly, neither do I. Either way Spider-verse is ranked highly."
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Lol more excuses
Buh buh buh"
Official Character Posters for 'The Little Mermaid',"Ok then explain to me why so many people will go see TLM in theaters over streaming 

It doesn't have practical effects to wow the audience like top gun does so its not gonna play like top gun maverick 

95% of the movie is CGI and it doesn't even look that good compared to avatar or even the batman so it's not gonna play like either of those 2"
