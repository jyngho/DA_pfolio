The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,I honestly don't care who is playing ariel. I want to see live action Ursula. I'm going to be pissed if they replace her song like they did jafars.
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"So my dumb ass kept hearing that Halle Berry was cast and I was surprised they’d cast her cause she’s like 50 and the character is supposed to be about 16. Then I see the pic and I’m like; damn they CGIed her face too much to make her look younger - it’s not a bad face but Halle’s face was just fine….. 

TIFU by learning there’s an actress called Halle Bailey who is NOT Halle Barry."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"I don't care much about the race swap as much as this is just another low effort live action remake for Disney that will 100% be a lesser version of the original.


Edit: I'll be honest while I didn't care much for it at least Malificent while a spiritual retelling of Sleeping Beauty it was pretty much it's own thing 100% Hell I probably won't watch it, but the new Mufasa movie will probably be more enjoyable then the Lion King remake just because it's new ground."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"i mentioned on here that my only issue was that her hair wasn't very vibrant and more of a natural red and had someone say it's not a natural shade since black people can't have red hair. i linked an article stating that yes, black people can in fact have red hair and they blocked me and reported me for being suicidal.

these people are everywhere

edit to confirm; *i* am not the one who said that black people can't have red hair, it was the person who blocked me over it who claimed as much."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,Even tho I’m black. Don’t really care who they casted as the little mermaid. Just wished they stopped making live action remakes no one asked for. The originals are fine.
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,I can’t believe they hired a surface-dweller to play the little mermaid!
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,I’m not mad that she’s black. I just think this movie doesn’t translate to a live action remake well. The animation is more colorful and vibrant. The lighting  choices in the preview just seem dingy. I wish they took a more imaginative route and went to the extreme with bioluminescence.

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,The lobster is actually a crab
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"People who are upset about this to that extent need to calm down. 

I was a child with very vivid red hair and was bullied for it. I adored Ariel because growing up she was the only Disney character that looked like me. I always got the Ariel barbie and had to be Ariel when playing pretend. I had a massive association with her because she looked like me. 

When the casting first broke I had a split second of disappointment that the live action version wouldn’t look like me. And then I realised that that was the situation thousands and thousands of black girls had growing up, except they didn’t have an Ariel then. So, I’m happy and honoured to share her.

If you can’t get over the fact that she looks different in this movie then simply you don’t need to watch it. But you also don’t need to devote your time and energy to tanking it - especially not going after this young actress, who is a real person with actual feelings. 

It’s not hard simply not to think about it anymore and not to be a dickhead about it."

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"My only complaint, and I'm not even sure if I'm correct, is that wouldn't your skin naturally be pruny, pale, and semi-translucent living as deep in the ocean as they do?

But, that's from a scientific standpoint. In reality this is a fantasy movie about a half fish girl with issues. Who gives a crap what color she is?"
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,Thousands? Rumours say it has like over 2M dislikes from around the WORLD!
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"The Disney version of Ariel was originally supposed to be blonde. But the animators didn’t like the colour they had to use for her hair in the undersea shadows. They thought it looked grey and boring. So the chose red hair instead. 
Point is, her look or ethnicity was chosen more by animation paint colour, not social or political reasons."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,ppl complaining that she’s black and I’m over here complaining she’s actually grey and that hair just looks like old period blood … where is the magic??

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,Damn so much division over a kids movie. If we actually put this focus to real shit and realize we’re being pinned against each other we’d be so much better off
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"Did I like seeing a character with very pale skin like me. Yeah I was.

Does it matter to the story line. No 

Do I care that character is played by a black actress. Nope why the hell would it matter, when it doesn’t affect the storyline. Why would it matter when it makes so many kids normally excluded included? 

At the end of the day you can identify with the cartoon version without being slighted about the live version."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,I feel like the people who are upset with the casting of this movie are just highlighting there racism. There is nothing wrong with who they chose
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"The racial discussion on this is so stupid because this is a live action with music comparable to that of a broadway performance, and broadway hasn’t been casting based on race for several years now but rather casting for adapting the music…. Like look at Hamilton…? Philippa Soo, Daveed Diggs, Renée Elise Goldsberry… 

I wonder if these people that care so much about the choice in casting for Ariel will give a single flying fuck when they see Sebastian hasn’t been cast by an actor from the Carribean… but a Jewish black guy? Don’t care? Then shut up…"
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"I've seen the trailer and my only though was that the song is beautiful, it was a lovely voice"
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"Fact of the matter is: nobody ever asks for these remakes, nobody cares to even give them the light of day because they seem to be a cash-grab and changing the very lure of what made the original animated one so memorable (like the unlimited possibilities with animation) and the poor casting decisions that exist solely to be inclusionary as opposed to original, they could’ve easily done a mermaid movie that would put Splash and The Little Mermaid to shame instead it just reeks of Hollywood’s decline and pandering to filmgoers who aren’t interested that much anymore.

Look at Regal’s bankruptcy.

Look at AMC’s huge decline.

Look at the box-office returns for some films.

I’m tired of remakes. I understand they don’t make up a huge chunk of films these days but they are getting very redundant and at this point deterring more people as opposed to uniting more."

It should be a triumph for her, and I hope she has the strength to still feel that way."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,It’s a kids movie. I bet if you asked little kids what they thought of Ariel they wouldn’t have an issue. It’s the stupid racist mothers and fathers making it an issue. I think she is lovely.

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,I'm actually curious what a mermaid creature should look like. If it was real would they really be blue or something? Or maybe see through if they're from the depths. Would their hair be fins instead of the hair that creates all that drag? This whole controversy only made me curious.

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,I’m a huge fan of the 1989 The Little Mermaid film but it’s almost 2023 and people getting pissy over Ariel being black are ridiculous. Disney didn’t come up with The Little Mermaid… Hans Christian Andersen did. There have been many adaptations of this over the years. Brandi played Cinderella before and I enjoyed that movie. I liked Hailey’s version of Part of Your World from the trailer. I mainly had issues with how dark it is (I get it takes place during the night) and the swimming looked a bit fake but I’m still willing to give the movie a chance.

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,I seriously feel like I’m in a fever dream between Rings of Power and now The Little Mermaid. It’s getting to the point that when someone says “the woke crowd” I feel like it’s a stand in for the n-word. Pieces of shit hiding behind keyboards.
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,I am usually a “stay as close to the source material as possible” kinda person but Disney’s little mermaid is already completely off from it’s source material and one of those stories that could be reimagined with a variety of casts without it affecting their world building at all. I don’t get the outrage? Like we have Brandi Cinderella and Downton Abbey girl Cinderella and they’re both great and we can enjoy both? The “anti-woke” crowd needs to chill.

Yeah it's not the vibrant color of the animated version but I think the cold darkness really meshes well with Ariel's desire for the surface world. She's trapped in the deep darkness of the ocean and longs for the sun. I'm hoping it will contrast with vibrancy on the surface. Could be a really interesting take to really emphasize the difference between the two worlds."

Pretty sure the people that are shitting their pants in fury over this is because they didn’t like the movie to begin with or they’re not happy with the race swap. Plain and simple."

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"Ngl, bothers me her hair isn’t red. I read an illustrated version of the original by HansC Anderson and the mermaid was blonde which I hated. 

Tbh tho all the people hating she’s black… it’s set in the Caribbean, not Denmark, smh lol. Stay mad. If I dislike this movie it’s going to be bc it sucks, not bc she’s black. She’s also gorgeous, like why is it so offensive? I hate the thought of live action but Disney does a great job. I anticipated hating beauty and the beast and it was decent. 

You can’t please em all"

But for the one where the the main actress looks like she can actually sing and hasn't been released?  

Racists out in fold or else no one would have cared if they sludged through all those crappy remakes.

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"Please take note that Disney always waits for people to already be sick of a trend in their content before casting a black lead, guaranteeing focus will be on race.

1)Racists lose their shit

3)Actual criticism of content is drowned out

4)Disney lives another creatively bankrupt day

5)Rinse and repeat."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"I think the actress is fine. I’m just so done with Disney remaking average movies to be shit live action films and cashing in on woke points. This movie will be shit like the other live actions, not because she’s black but because it’s fucking Disney ruining everything yet again. 

If they really want a successful live action stop remaking musicals and do Atlantis. That movie slapped, you can fit more representation without people getting too upset about ‘retconning’ as it has a good amount of representation naturally in the main cast and it probably would actually be good and not many people saw the original so it’s a great chance to open up a whole new consumer base and possibly blow up a new franchise by getting out the old merch they never sold."

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"First of all, I don't care that she is black, I love it, I love little girls cheer cuz their hero looks like them. It is so important and incredible, and heartwarming. 

What I am upset about is that Disney DIDNT NOT PREDICT THAT THIS KIND OF OUTRAGE WOULD UNFORTUNATELY HAPPEN AND PUT A BEAUTIFUL TALENTED YOUNG LADY IN HARMS WAY. They had to know this would happen and they tossed her to the wolves, just like the industry has been doing to young girls for years. Her skintone generates conversation and free marketing??? SHAME ON DISNEY FOR SUCH EXPLOITATION. This is what I am outraged about and this is what I think everyone should analyze and consider. She was done dirty. Years later we will look at this and finally see the horror we collectively put her through.We can make it better now. This is why I still can't justify giving my money to Disney.

And this is for sure a marketing strategy because now there is a choice, you can go watch a movie to support  HB and make it better for her and do exactly what Disney wants you to do and give them money... or is what majority choose will do nothing and then this big thing will crush and burn and bury her under itself. Or you can write a chaotic weird angry post somewhere where people will see it and say that we need to stop bullying a young lady, and maybe be kinder to her online, while telling Disney that they need to do better or their business will suffer.

I hope i got my point across. My heart is breaking for this young lady. Someone please put it in better words than me, I am not eloquent enough

Let's do better. It was us who had been watching and aiding in exploitation of young people, men and women by the industry. We saw Britney break down and lose hee freedom, we saw Vanessa H apologizing for having her private vulnerable pictures be posted by a person she trusted, we watched these girls be ruined and we should not let this happen again."

But I'm still sad for childhood me, who was so excited to see myself in Ariel as a red-haired girl, and I don't see that anymore. She was my favourite princess solely because she looked like me. 

Because of that, I understand the joy black Ariel brings, but it still makes me sad that they rebranded an established character instead of making a new one for black girls to see themselves in."

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"Excuse me but i don't get it,why does it matter if the character of a movie/videogame/cartoon is not white? Why does it matter so much? I mean i don't care what color or ethnicity that character is as long as the movie is interesting to watch,if a movie has a good story and interesting characters i will love the movie and the characters in that movie and i will praise that movie story writing. But if a movie will have an awfull story writing it won't matter the character colour of skin,it will be simply be unliked by me personaly because of the story writing and plot story.Is this really an issue? I mean we are all humans,no matter the colour of our skin,we bleed the same way the same red blood and we get hurt in the same way.why does it matter so much if a fictional madeup mermaid by Walt disney should be only white,heck when i was young and i have watched the Mermaid Ariel for the first time my parents TV colors were messed up and for me the mermaid was not white but pink and i remember that i said:' woah that pink mermaid is cool'."

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"I do not see the point in any of these remakes at all.

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,So I guess people are talking about the fact that she is black but they are clearly missing the bigger issue. Disney actively chose to cast an actress that isn’t a real mermaid. This is appropriation and we need to stand up for the mermaids.

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"I refuse to entertain this.

The movie is going to be shit but it will not be because Ariel is black. It will be because it is recycled garbage made to make parents feel nostalgic and children to feel like they are watching something new.

It is Hedge Fund cinema and all that matters is the bottom line, art be damned.

That is why studios like A24 resonate with people... independently owned and artist driven."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"As far as I'm concerned, Ariel only has 2 traits that are actually important to get right.

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,I don't  care that  the little  Mermaid  is black. I'm  annoyed that  its yet another remake rather than an original  film. I would like another original  film with a black princess - like the princess & the frog.  Race swapping is just lazy imo.

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"They can be mad all they want, but the director specifically said NO ONE auditioned as well as Halle, therefore she deserves the part.

Be happy with what you get.""

This is the future of the entertainment industry: Create bland works that are either remakes/reboots or bland continuations of original works and include 'representation' so that they can justify it to the public and call anyone who dislikes it a bigot. 

It's so condescending and cynical, and it fucking works. Disney as a company is truly a disgusting example of late stage capitalism, and yet they have managed to get the average person, even those on the far left, to support them. The astroturfing has worked."

She's got a great face for the role; all big eyes and her nose looks spot on. I'm not sold on her voice in the trailer. The added high note and vocal roll leads me to think we are going to get some diva singer version of the songs and thats a bit of a shame. I guess I just wonder if she was the best person who auditioned, or if it was decided that Ariel would be black and then they went from their. If it's the former, then I'm all for it. If it's the latter then not so much.  It's a kids movie, I'm not going to lose any sleep over it either way. But in the larger scheme of things I'm generally not thrilled about a billion dollar company changing established characters to score diversity points. I would say just write new stories, but given that disney cant write anything halfway decent these days I can see how that might not work out. I'll wait to pirate it and see, I suppose."

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"Is it all because the actress playing Ariel is black?  If so, fuck all those racist assholes.  This is an adaptation of a cartoon where race was in no way, shape, or form a key plot point of the story.  She could be white, black, brown, anything.  Literally has no impact on the plot.  I only care at all about the demographics of casting choices if the demographics are a key aspect of the plot.  The only thing that’s key about the little mermaid is that she has the lower half of a fish.  That’s it.  Something that would be fair to get upset about is if they decided to switch which part is fish vs humanoid.  Like if she had nice lady legs and everything from the waist up was a tuna I’d have a little trouble with that, but this?  Literally doesn’t matter.  What could Ariel being black possibly take away from the movie?  

If they are mad because Disney seems to just be cranking out shitty live-action remakes of movies that were never meant to be live action, that’s justified.  I thought the “live” action lion king movie was a giant disappointment, and have no desire to see any of these others remakes."

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"I gotta say I dont like these types of castings usually BUT when its something like this where it's an ancient story with hundreds of adaptations then the whole point which is to do something different every time. 

If its Johnny Storm or Archie or whatever I get it, those characters exist in a specific way. But fairy tales? They're basically fables. You should aim to tell it differently every time for sure."

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"I'm just done with Disney Live Action Remakes. They suck. The writing adaptation sucks, the music sucks, they don't have the same magic as the original animations - is this movie even gonna have talking animals? Like, are they gonna repeat the Lion King fiasco where the animals were so emotionally bland for the sake of ""realism""? Can't imagine that'll go well with Flounder.

Seriously they just need to do something original. Even Disenchanted looks fresh in comparison - and it's a sequel!"

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,To be honest I believe that only tiny amount of these dislikes were due to the actress. I think most of it is due to the fact that people are fed up with the remakes from Disney.
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"I really don't care about who's playing her, and it's disappointing to see so much hate surrounding the skin color of an actress. What should be mentioned though, is that this trailer just sucks, regardless. Nothing happens, we see a wave, some fish swimming and a girl looking up to the top of the ocean singing three lines of text. I was really hoping the trailer would spark any potential interest in me to watch the movie, but it didn't. And therefore, deserves a dislike."

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"For everyone pretending review bombing is not happening and the outrage is about Disney not inventing a new story and instead swapping race or gender in an existing story: look up early reviews for other (original) movies/games/tv series with POC and/or female leads that came out the last few years: Eternals, Captain Marvel, Black Widow, Lucy, Kate, Batwoman, *Honk For Jesus. Save Your Soul*. 

Now do the same for sequels or reboots like The Last Jedi, The Last of Us II, Ghostbusters (2016). This is not a singular ""Lazy Disney"" problem!

And for those who go the obtuse ""what if they'd made Black Panther white"" route: Black Panther was a major victim of review bombing as well! And the negative comments and dislikes for the trailer of its sequel don't bode well either...

Oh well, we'll see what the early audience scores for The Woman King will be, but since negative reviews cannot possibly be about insecure incels being scared of strong women or people of color, they'll be as positive as the current critic scores, right? Right?!"

It’s for kids anyway so if they like it then it’s okay with me. In the end it doesn’t affect me. I just hope her hair is a brighter color! It looked very dim in the trailer and I feel red hair is a hallmark of the character. The skin color doesn’t matter much. The dislikes are stupid."

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"I’ll keep saying this on every thread I see about this movie. Ariel should always have been a person of color. I get it, HCA was from Denmark and he never saw a black person before or whatever, but telling this story in the modern age, it makes much more sense for Ariel to be a POC. It’s a story about two different worlds clashing and a forbidden love, why not visually depict the characters as from diverse cultures? This should always have been an interracial relationship."

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"Somebody actually said ""I hate when they make remakes and ruin the movie."" 

Now my questions in order.

1. Did you complain about any other remakes? and if so please list those remakes that were terrible . 

2. Why is it always a complaint made from a very new account?

3. The trailer only showed a 1:1 recreation of the original movie, with two key differences, 

A) It's live action.

B) Ariel is black. 

How can a movie that you have never seen, be ruined based on these two things? What exactly of these two things is upsetting?"

Why couldn’t they create an original black mermaid character? Why did they have to race swap a white character with the same name? Yeah it’s lovely to see all the little black girls eyes light up when they see it, but it’s such a shame they had to piggyback off the success of the previous character. Why not create an original black Disney princess character? And that is a genuine question, I have no idea why 

I saw a photo of Ryan gosling as the next black panther which is also a fictional character, guarantee you it would get the same response."

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"I don't think Ariel should be cast as black. It's obviously a decision that is born of an ideological agenda. Ariel was written as a white character and there's no reason to change that.

I would be just as against it if a black character were portrayed as a white character - there's simply no need for it.

However, if Ariel being black brings joy to people and it is what people want then I'm happy for it to be made, and for those people to go see it. I'm not required to agree with it though or go see the movie, and feeling this way doesn't make me a racist. I just appreciate story canon and think it should be respected."

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"All I can say is it's funny how people and media make it a racial discussion when the actual problem is that the character doesn't resemble the character that most people got to know when they were younger. ""But the danish"" stfu, Ariel the mermaid isn't a 100% accurate adaption of the original tale and that's fine, what's not fine is changing the complete look of your character. Imagine a Star Wars episode playing in the timeline of Luke fighting Vader but Vader is now a Satyr with blonde hair and Luke is a Dark Elf.

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"I can perfectly well see why. I for one have disliked that trailer more due to the fact that Halle Bailey's pop star singing voice, when she sang that bit of ""Part Of Your World"" with almost a Michael Jackson style has made me cringe. (""Wish I could beeeEEEeheeee..."") REGARDLESS of giving Bailey red hair.

I say this COMPLETELY without racist overtones and more with extreme criticism of Bailey's singing voice. I don't deny that she has a good voice, but it would've been more appropriate for ""Elton John and Tim Rice's Aida"" than ""The Little Mermaid."" What Disney SHOULD have done was particularly people with more classical singing, ideally searching out newcomers from Wales, but noooooooo. This movie is more than just going to be a box office bomb.  It's going to be a box office nuke.

The only good thing about the trailer I'm going to mention is the amazing special effects. Frankly, I'm only going to go to that movie for them, preferably in 3D form, and I swear that whenever Bailey is going to sing, I will be blocking out the music by covering my ears, least I can do in a cinema. Again, I say this without the extremest trace of racism...Disney. Should. Have. Gone. To. Wales. To. Find. A. New. Ariel. Or they should've cast Bella Thorne, the best redhead out there now."

This world is diseased by white supremacy.

I think Disney will make this movie and then make a live action film featuring mostly Aryan actors and that film will end up making tons of money.  they did the same thing with The Princess and the Frog’ there was so much backlash and anger about having a black princess and then they came out with frozen which made a ton of money so they recouped any losses they had for featuring a POC.  

Again the amount of hatred towards Black people is just astonishing.  It’s really eye opening and depressing."

I’m sure they’ll put out a statement in the coming days denouncing racism, yet this is the same company that took their one black character in their Star Wars Sequel Trilogy and diminished him into an ineffective, comedy role. Then, as a further insult, they shrink him in the poster in China.

I genuinely can not comprehend anyone having an issue with this and then putting in the effort to tell the world how much they dislike it. What the fuck is wrong with people? I mean, honestly, if a live action mermaid looked like the cartoon, it would be kinda weird. This actor looks great for the role.

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"Unpopular opinion. Don’t make white characters poc for the sake of diversity. Make more well done poc characters for the sake of diversity.

A persons race is conveyed through their identity as well as their outward appearance so using the character traits and pre established ideals and identity of a white coded character adds a layer of white washing and doesn’t create an original character that truely resonates with the minority you portray.

It’s why original movies that focus on well portrayed poc characters work so much better. Also enough of old shit rebranded as new shit by redoing it live action or changing one little thing. This imo feels lazy and like Disney doesn’t want to make good representation because it takes too much to talk with people of a minority and get it right. It’s not the first time they’ve done lazy representation. Look their last poc Disney princess movie, raya and the last dragon was such a mishmash of cultural appropriation and an unstructured mess of S.E.A. rep cause They barely had any help from S.E.A. people when creating it.

I have actual things to do in my life that aren't about a mermaid movie.

I am so envious of people who apparantly have room to have emotions or lasting opinions or the need to express thoughts about a mermaid movie.

I wish I had the free space for something this trivial.

There's just... too many other actually valid topics to invest mental energy in.

I don't even upvote things I like lmao. Can't imagine extending the required hand energy just to disapprove of a kids movie.

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"The backlash to inclusiveness and the backlash to the backlash just makes me not trust reviews and ratings at all.

Was there a process where we were *asked* if we ""wanted"" a movie? I don't remember if they ever handed us questionnaires about whether we wanted the LotR trilogy, or Terminator II, or any other movie in existence. We didn't vote for the next movie to be produced.

So when some of y'all are saying ""no one asked for this"", I guess you're technically correct; but no one ""asked"" for any other movies, either. So what on earth are you guys complaining about?"

Seems like they don't have a lot of faith in the movie, if they're jumping to doing shit like that immediately to build up publicity."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"I wonder how people would feel about a gender swap lol

Instead of race swapping characters that where originally white, why not introduce new stories with new characters that may be minority ethnicity? Imagine how people would feel if Disney took a black character and race swapped to white. I know that cannot happen today cause there still exists racism and Disney is doing its part such as this to address and fight it. I just think it would be more authentic to introduce new great characters. As we see here people are cynical when you take a white character and make it black, it feels more like a political statement then the actresses merits or story 

You just know when they were casting for this role they knew it wasnt going to be a white person"

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,I don’t see why people are so upset about her look being unrealistic for a mermaid.

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"I think people are making this too much about race when really I think the majority of people are just over these live action Disney remakes…

Why is it another movie with completely washed out colors. Like yeah it's nice they recast some actors as poc since they refuse to make new stuff they are kinda out of other options but are they trying to make diverse movies unlikable?

Also why is the article quoting Matt Walsh if you ever make an argument and feel a need to quote him you probably made a bad argument. For his arguments to make sense you gotta believe that history started when you were born and like ffs he is qt-ing that black kids are more violent etc, like come on find a less racist person for a quote."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"Disney needs to stop doing these remakes.

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"There are obviously a lot of racists people who hate this new mermaid because she’s black, but I think that a lot of dislikes comes from people who hate Disney because they know that these race swaps are done not for the sake of real inclusion or diversity, but just to show “ehy look how progressive we are”. It’s also likely just a commercial move, they know that most critics will give a good rating because they’re scared to appear racist even if this live-action remake is gonna be bland as fuck like the other ones."

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"But also, it’s not really a great trailer.

It's not just the underwater scenes either, the ones taking place above the waves feel more in place in a bootleg DC offshoot than any Disney property, it feels so dirty and grimy, ew.

For even more relative comparison, watch this side-by-side with other just-announced Disney trailers like https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VayH-CnPh7s and even the Hocus Pocus 2 one has a better dynamic range https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idc0EOmKr30"

My problem is that this is another lame, half assed live action remake. Disney has proved to us time and time again that it can’t make a good live action remake because that is impossible. The originals will always have better writing, story, and direction. I’m a bit iffy on Melissa McCarthy as Ursula but Javier Bardem as King Triton I am very excited to see. The only thing I look forward to in this movie is actually the cast itself, it’s gotten a lot of great talent like Bailey and Bardem, along with Daveed Diggs, Jacob Tremblay, and Awkwafina. Will I give this movie a chance, yes. Will I most likely hate it, yes."

But no, now I have to say ""oh this is fine"" because to say otherwise puts you in the camp of the actual bigoted monsters. It's like it's the ultimate Disney marketing tactic. Fuck this movie.

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"I don’t care about the race swap, but it’s legit unnecessary and will bring tons of trouble. I work at Disney parks and I’m worried about what will happen with the meet and greets. Ariel in the parks is a white red head, as she is in classic movie. Will she now be brown? Will she be both? What if a black family wants to meet brown Ariel but they get the white redhead one? They will be mad as fuck. What if racists run into the brown one? They will be mean as fuck to her. It will be hell. 

If Disney leaves classic Ariel at the parks, people will call out racism. If they make her brown, they will get called out as woke and will provoke hostility from some guests. If they do both? Then problems like I described above will occur every fucking day. 

As I said, I’m indifferent of the movie’s portrayal of Ariel. But you don’t just change the race of an established character without sure chaos ready to take place. Dumb move imo. could’ve hired that actress to be Tiana and would’ve done great."

Ariel is a fictional character. She can be white, black, brown, orange, purple, pink, polka dot, and/or zebra striped. It's not based off a real person.

It just doesn’t make sense from a logistics standpoint to have dark skinned mermaids. Sunlight isn’t able to affect sea life in the same way it affects land creatures since water refracts, thus deluding the UV rays. This is why sea life was the first to evolve as it wasn’t exposed to radiation prior to the forming of the ozone layer. 

They could just as easily create a new story based on the same fairytale without it being a copy/paste of their original version of the movie but with more diversity. They made multiple version of Cinderella without having the exact same setup."

Mermaids aren’t real!!!! If that’s the case, can we all be upset that Avatar is played by white folks and not real blue people!!!!"
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"Racist twits. There’s simply no justification to dislike this movie yet.  It may suck in its own right, but as it stands right now only racism."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"I have hated the term ""ginger"" since it started a few years ago. My daughter is a redhead, as is my ex-wife. My daughter is all about hello kitty and Bluey right now, she won't care about little mermaid until she has a unicorn horn and magical powers. It's who she is, it's what she likes. To see other little girls scream ""mommy she's brown like me!"" at the little mermaid, my dad heart just melts. All kids deserve heros, parents just need to get out of the way sometimes."

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"It’s make believe, not a documentary or biography…and it’s about mermaids. God damn mermaids who last I checked weren’t real either. So for all I care or anyone else we could make them have blue skin w a thick Boston accent. Point being, if they cast a POC and that upsets you, man you’ve got far more important things to be pissed about. Like real life problems not make believe problems."

Perspective, people."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"I was immediately outraged when I read the first sentence. I don't care about Disney making live action versions of thier animated classics, or if they change the color of thier skin.

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou," I’ve been arguing with idiots all day about this.

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"I’m all for having someone not already hugely famous as the main character. 

So tired of every movie needing huge actors to either play or voice the characters. 
There once was a time when animated movies didn’t have to push the famous actors that voice them all over the marketing. It takes away from the movie."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"I don't think raceswapping white characters for sake of diversity has helped reduce racism but has led to dividing people. **Many** movies and stories with white characters are being race swapped from white to black, meanwhile when a movie or story that is based on black culture there is little to no changes to ethnicity of the black characters to diversify the story/movie. You can say ""this is just a children movie"", and you're right, but it's happening almost everywhere. And it's not just limited to race swapping, there is also gender swapping, changing of characters persona, dialogues, plots and more.

Can't say I mind this trailer though, the actor looks and sounds nice, but it's really uncomfortable to see people call others racists so easily while ignoring the many things happening in popular culture that makes people angry."

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,I’m more upset about that unnecessary vocal run she added to a perfect song
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"Personally I like when shows / films stick to the source material, as in, the people LOOK like they are from that thing I love to watch... if wanting that makes me racist then, weird take, but okay.

The actress in this looks nothing like the source material.

They got live action Aladdin right. Will Smith was a weird choice but whatever. 

At the end of the day these movies are bad regardless...

So go ahead Disney, waste your money on whatever you want."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,Isn’t Disney the same people that remove black people from Chinese posters to please them? And you guys are gonna run and support this money grab? I don’t get it

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"If I was casting Little Mermaid, I would have picked either a White girl or an Asian girl, but they are obviously going for a certain demographic with this play and it's probably part of a broader advertising strategy. Between black panther, princess and the frog and the new little mermaid, they are building up a nice little portfolio."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,Racists didn’t like this.
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,Fuck those 1.5 million racist assholes
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"Race/gender swapping is so unauthentic and just plain lazy. And let's be honest, it's Disney here that we are talking about so it's not like they are being altruistic. 

Only race swapped I've ever liked was Nick Fury. They wanted to update him in the Spiderman comics and they modeled him after a much more badass Samuel L. Jackson. This wasn't just a race swap though, as it was also a character upgrade and was popular enough among fans that they cast him to play that role in the movies."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,I love Rings of Power and am a true Tolkien fan. An enormous amount of reviews are bro brothers who really aren’t fans just ripping the show because Elon musk tweeted he didn’t like it. The toxic male crap happening all over the place is disgusting. It’s gotten to the point that I don’t pay attention to the reviews or read a few and once they start spewing “woke” or “diverse” stuff I tune them out. They are bullies like their overlords. Streaming services should go back to Nielsen ratings or most watched ratings. I’m glad Netflix got rid of it.
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,It wasn’t necessary at all to change this.  I’d say that they even damaged a positive role model for young red heads who often are picked on as well.  They should just make new movies with new characters who are black.  Or heaven forbid they actually make some more black fairy tales.  Almost none of the ones I was read growing up have even 2nd tier movies.

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"Y’all acting like it’s a crime to not like the constant race swapping, Having to preface all this shit with disclaimers and all, can’t have rational discourse on here.  On the other hand as well, white guys been playing Persians, Egyptians and everything in between for ages, where was the massive outrage then. But two wrongs don’t make a right is my motto. All this race swapping is unnecessary and reeks and pandering."

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"I don’t understand tho. Why do they make stories of white established character instead of just using an ip they already have like princess and the frog and promote there movie to black audiences like that? White people will have just as much of a problem with race swapping a character just as much as Asian/Japanese people had a problem with Scarlet Johansson playing as a Japanese character in ghost in the shell. 

And y’all redditors out here thanking Disney for diversity and inclusion let’s not forget how they receive a lot of money for working with the CCP and shot “Mulan” (live action version)in the same province where xinjiang Muslims are being tortured.

These guys aren’t inclusive at all, they are just pandering lol"
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"I’m upset now!!! This complete bs. Why isn’t the original little mermaid blue!!!! That’s discrimination against Mermaid’s!! They are blue with dark hair!! Why did they make her pale with red hair?! Unreal.

Sad to see, personally I loved the trailer, to me she has red hair, that's her signature feature in the Disney version, and that girls voice is so enchanting, she's going to kill it."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"Oh come on, the film didn't look THAT bad. Sure the animation isn't top notch and it's another unnecessary reboot. But, I'm still going to see it cause I enjoy watching new films. I even watch poorly reviewed movies like Pinocchio and Light-year (I saw both opening day) cause I want to form my own opinion, not have it decided for me by other people.

I'm looking forward to the music. I love musicals especially in the theater with the surround sound. I suspect the soundtrack is going to be the best part of this movie."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"Wtf is this? Srsly? Over the little mermaid, guys?"

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"What bothers me the most is that at the end when she's singing looking up at the surface, she's *clearly* not underwater. Like they didn't even try to make it look like she was.

If it's going to be like that in the whole of the released film, I feel like the whole movie will feel ""off"" to a major degree.

I kinda suspect this will flop at the box office, and get panned as the worst of the Disney live action films."

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"Mermaids are mythical creatures but it bothers me that live action ones don't have gills.

Remember these are kids movies that introduce life lessons with musicals and shit lol.
It’s not like they changed Italian Pinocchio to a Asian Bamboocchio. Or Snow White to Coal Black and the 7 little people. The blue fairy in the new Pinocchio is much better and more memorable than the original too"

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,Why does Disney even keep making these remakes? They’re all horrible.

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"These movies could make $0 and get zero views and they would achieve their aim: extend the copyright on the originals for another 50 years.

None of these remakes matter."

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"If you're a grown man who's irrationally angry about a Disney princess in a movie for 8 year old girls not being race accurate to mermaid lore, you should be forced to wear a badge  so the rest of us can identify you on sight and avoid you.

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"I didn't like that trailer either and it's not the actresses' skin-color.

1. It shows nothing to indicate it has something new or cool or better to make it worth watching over the old one.
2. The song sounds worse to me then the original rendition of the song. Maybe it's not the actress and a director choice/direction, but either way, downgrade.
3. The cgi they did on her hair floating in the water is really bad. It's not that her hair is in long dreadlocks, it's that parts of the dreadlocks looked smudged/blurry. Like someone was in photoshop and smeared them. It's very weird and dosen't look real to me at all. And the smudges sometimes cross over her dreadlocks too?? I don't know if they are trying to add like badly drawn loose straight hair mixed in with her dreads but if so it looks stupid/fake and dosen't make sense?

And this is the trailer. If they can't pick something to show their movie is worth watching, find a single song that is either new or sounds at least as good as the original version, or manage to make the main character's CGI look believable . . . that bodes badly for overall quality.

Based off this trailer I'm hesitant to go see this film, it looks sucky. And for reference I'm the target audience. Not only did I watch the original when I was a little girl, I have a mixed race six year old with super curly hair and their Ariel's skintone.  I really want good kids Disney movies in theatres to take her to now that COVID is over (enough?) and she's old enough to sit still and quiet the whole time. But I'm defiantly not going until I see reviews that don't say this film is another trash-sandwich where they remake a classic Disney cartoon ""live action"" with worse musical numbers.

Edit: I love Emma Watson but I did not go see the new version of Beauty and the Beast and from the clips and songs I saw on youtube I feel very good about that decision."

I don't disagree that it won't be as impactful as the original.

However, this movie has still taken hundreds (thousands?) of professionals years to make. Script, scoring, storyboarding, acting, editing, etc. Sure, they didn't make the script and score from scratch, but they still had to do tons of work on it.

To call it low-effort is a pretty big slap in the face to all the people who have worked on it. The *initial idea* may have been low-effort, a couple people just saying ""Hey, wanna do The Little Mermaid again? Yeah? Cool!"" but not from then on."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,">I don't care much about the race swap as much as this is just another low effort live action remake for Disney that will 100% be a lesser version of the original.

Yep! I've disliked every live action ~~money grab~~ remake so far. They failed to transcend the original in any meaningful way. Or failed to make something new and original. Or they went sideways with the concept that didn't really work for me.

So my current opinion? It'll be a bland remake in the vein of their other attempts to date. I wish people would stop seeing these movies so Disney can are least shuffle their vast resources to other endeavors that may or may not suck, but at least it'll end the parade of stupid pointless ~~money grabs~~ remakes."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"This has become Hollywood PR 101.

Then you act like anybody who doesn’t like you’re a crappy product isn’t progressive enough. 

This is known as the “Ghostbusters Defense”. It’s 100% successful  and can’t be countered. 

***

I’m not surprised that Disney is using this. Frankly I have no confidence in Disney’s ability to do anything, particularly when it comes to a live action remakes from the golden age of Disney. The problem is that they go out of their way to remove any plot elements that are ideologically unacceptable to the Chinese government, while at the same time putting in a couple token progressive points that don’t really offend China like two same sex characters holding hands. 

Let’s take a look at Mulan. The original movie is a flawless and engrossing story about individualism, self determination, and the triumph the sprite of someone who is willing to break all traditional social norms. All of these things are completely antithetical to the Chinese communist party, so all of that was taken away in the remake. 

On top of that, the driving force of the original Mulan is the character arc as she develops from a ditzy klutz who doesn’t know her place in the world to someone who literally changes the world. Well, you can’t have development if you don’t start low and build her up overtime. In order to have a growth you have to start from nothing. But China is really really sensitive about negative portrayals of any of its folkloric euros, so the idea of portraying Hua Mulan  as a clumsy everyman is not something that they’d accept. So instead they gave us this ridiculously overpowered super heroine who starts out the movie inexplicably being a total bad ass and then the whole movie is just her running around killing Mongols like a one woman army. It absolutely sucks ass because there’s no character development arc. 

Why am I bringing all this up now? Because everything that made The Little Mermaid’s plot what it was is *even more* antithetical to China’s ruling party. Ariel represents an oppressed girl in a dreary, constructive society, who dreams of casting off the oppressive social norms of her culture and rising above the surface, seeing the whole world for what it truly is and living in the land where  people are free. This could not be more offensive as a concept to the Chinese government. 

Also there’s some thing that China has a really weird hard-on for censoring, and it’s not homosexuality. For some reason they get really really touchy on lesser animals being depicted as equal to humans. I’ve never understood it, but you can have a movie about animals that talk to each other or you can have a movie about humans - but if you have animals that are sentient  and talking to humans as equals, that really gets their panties in a twist for some reason.

Disney got slammed hard on the western PR front for bending over backwards to appease China. So now they’re putting in a few token progressive points to show that they haven’t forgotten about the rest of the world, but they still really, really want to try to keep that Chinese market open to them as much as they can. They’re probably going to reach some compromises on the version they released to the west, with a few short clips that are pre-agreed-upon to be censored out of the Chinese version. But the heart and soul of the original movie is just not going to be there because it’s too antithetical to the Chinese government."

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,Yeah it's like the backlash to this trailer and just casting direction in general has me really annoyed but also like....... that doesn't mean I'm going to watch the movie.
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"Yeah tbh I just watched Maleficent 2 and while it’s not a GOOD movie per se…it was hella enjoyable. 

I think the best live action adaptations have been the ones that put a spin on the animated versions and dont remake them scene for scene. 

Cinderella was great imo. They changed just enough up, kept some nostalgic references, but didnt make it a full blown musical that followed the og scene for scene. 

Maleficent changed it up a bunch which was great to see. Not peak cinema but still a fun watch. 

The Jungle Book, same thing as Cinderella. 

Cruella was fantastic. Probably my favorite so far. They really put a twist on the character and made her backstory, fun, interesting, and meaningful while making her a complex character you’re both rooting for and against.

Beauty and the Beast was fine. It was a well made film. But it was just a replica that thankfully happened to capture a lot of its own magic. 

Aladdin tried to replicate what Beauty and the Beast did but fell flat in a lot of areas and failed to have it’s own magic. 

Lion King was just pointless. It was basically a frame by frame remake of the 2D animated version with little magic. It drained all the magic you’d get out of the stage play or the animated version. 

If anything they should have just gone with making a Mufasa prequel from the get go imo. 

Alice In Wonderland was fun. It was campy, not an A+ film but still brought something different. It was Alice’s return to Wonderland and as adult. It kept the story as something new and added more elements of the original book which was great. 

Mulan was somewhere between Cinderella and Beauty and the Beast. It didnt turn itself into a musical, and fleshed out/changed certain characters which added to the story, but was still missing something. It felt like the movie had a beginning and an end but no real middle. I would still say this is probably in the better half of the live action adaptations.  

Havent seen Dumbo, Lady & the Tramp, or Pinocchio yet but from reviews, they seem to suffer similar issues to Lion King. 

I just hope the Little Mermaid changes shit up enough and maybe incorporates other elements from the original fairytale to make it interesting. I really dont want it to be a frame by frame remake of the animated movie."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"I enjoyed Malificent for similar reasons that I enjoyed Wicked.   Like, a suspiciously similar amount."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"Yep, same here. All aspects will either be ""yep, copied from the original."" All changes will be worse. The movie will be way longer than it needs to be, with a couple original songs nobody will remember, and bastardized versions of the original songs.

And it'll make a billion dollars and continue Disney's money train."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,TIL there is a Mufasa movie being made!
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"remember everyone, live action is ALWAYS a downgrade from animation."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,Maleficent was at least unique. This will a soulless cash grab like the other remakes.
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"Yea, but each of these remakes basically gross a billion each.  If people still want these then good for them, they’ll get more with these numbers.  I don’t watch them, but it doesn’t bother me since I’m clearly not the market they’re going after.  If they’re doing good numbers, it keeps people entertained and people employed.  Sounds fine to me."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,I mean live action remakes are tough. They usually bomb. But the quality of the movie isn’t what people are upset over here. That’s the problem
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,The live action remakes need to continue at least until the live action brave little toaster remake.
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"The whole movie was the voice performances music and animation, these remakes take two of those and just do the same songs. This kind of criticism will be brushed over though because everyone wants racist responses."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"Anyone who cares about a fictional species being a different race in their cash grab remake needs to get help.

Hate the movie for the same reason all the other live action remakes have been hated: because they’re soulless cash grabs by a behemoth company intent on owning all fiction. 

I didn’t see the Mulan remake and gave zero shits about it. I didn’t see the Jungle Book remake and didn’t care about it. I didn’t see Cruella or Malificent or the Lion King (a movie I have a big soft spot for) or anything else that has been released. And for all it, my reason was not because of the brain dead reasons a loud bunch of people have with this one. It’s because these movies didn’t need to be remade and I wasn’t going to participate in the cash grab."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"I grew up with Ariel being white. But of all the choices, why Ariel? I couldn’t care less if Spider Man was suddenly black.

But will I start WW3 over it? Nope. I will still watch it and don’t mind it at all.

I’ll have to do a one minute explanation to my daughters and that’s it."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,The annoying thing to me is that will say that all criticism comes from people that don't like a black Ariel. So they just go ahead with the low effort live action.
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"Let's be honest here. Every Disney movie coming out is pretty much advertising for the merchandise. Very low effort. Disney crunched the numbers and realized that if they can now sell white and black skined Ariel toys therefore they need a black actress in the live action movie. 

They also get plenty of free advertising because of the controversy.  Turning Red was a pretty forgettable movie that was seen by people who just wanted to see what the fuss was about. Disney has been pissing off conservative for media coverage.  I expect to see a live action version of Pinocchio with a visible minority playing the lead or having a gay kissing scene."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,Literally the only live action I liked was Beauty and the Beast
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"The recent Pinocchio CGI/live action is also a huge mess from all the plot changes and, funny enough, it's very inconsistant/ugly CGI for many characters"
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"So far, every live action have been garbage, Pinocchio Aladin Mulan, cruella, lion king, dumbo, Cinderella, beauty and the beast… of course this is gonna be shit. But because every other one has been shit"
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,I dislike race swaps when it's just like 1 person.  Black Ariel is cool if they do the whole family.  If you just swap Ariel it screams low effort.
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,Tbh yea it’s just another let’s see if we can change up some old shit and have the cash come in thing. Unoriginal af
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"Step 1) choose random iconic character 

Step 2) race and or gender swap

Step 3) use low budget and put minimal effort in. 

Bonus: hire writers and directors that have never seen the original 

Step 4) accuse anyone that says said iconic character isn't being portrayed properly as a bigot

Step 5) get that sweet, sweet free advertising by the brain dead people that can't accept it's okay for characters to not change AND the reeeeeeee people that counter

Step 6) ????

Step 7) Profit?!"
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,">low effort 

Nothing low effort here.  These movies take a lot of effort and coordination to make."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,How am I supposed to enjoy a movie if I don’t already know how it ends?
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,I'm looking forward to the Pitch Meeting for this!!
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,I literally only care because I want them to make new shit instead of rehashing every movie under the sun in a new medium because they're out of ideas.
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,I wasn't much of a fan of Mulan either but I appreciated that it wasn't really an adaptation of the cartoon and more its own retelling of the original Hua Mulan story.
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,Honestly I think they only cast a black actress to drum up controversy and blame racism for poor reviews or performance. Probably even stop some bad reviews from sources who don't want to get attacked for being racist by calling a shit movie a shit movie.
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"> …the new Mufasa movie…

The new fucking *WHAT*????"
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,This is how we know that the producers have no intent of this being about increasing minority representation or some sort of cultural progress. It is simply a cash grab riding on the coattails of nostalgia and social media engagement fueled by controversy.
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"They do nothing to make it better. I did the the Cinderella one albeit it felt a bit short, like something was missing. But many seem so low effort."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"Everytime, since the beginning, people complain about movies not targeted to them."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"Exactly! The actress playing Ariel could be purple for all I care.

The horrible special effects are what get me. Ariel’s tail looks fake and her hair isn’t moving enough to give a somewhat accurate feeling of being underwater. I just hope Flounder, Sebastian, et al are better rendered than Disney’s previous subpar adaptations.
Edit: don’t do grammar at 3am"
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,This is my gripe as well. Just another low effort cash grab. Maybe it will be decent.
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,Then don't watch it? I know I won't. It's not that hard. I didn't watch any of the others either.
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"Heh, I got reported for being suicidal, once.  No idea what comment I made inspired someone to abuse the function like that.

edit - ha, someone reported this one too"
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,I honestly chalked it up to the hair being shown in a nighttime scene under water. Bad lighting and cgi. Hopefully the hair is a little more vibrant under betting lighting.
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"The whole trailer looked way too dark and gloomy. Unrionically kinda spooked me with the underwater segments and the fish tail, something I’d expect from a movie attempting to illustrate how dark fairy tales really are, not a remake of a colorful movie."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"i mean, seriously are people really going to discuss what is the natural hair color of .. mermaids??"
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,Ariel's hair in the original wasn't a natural shade of red either
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,">i mentioned on here that my only issue was that her hair wasn't very vibrant…

The deeper you are in the ocean the more muted colors are. Red is the first color to disappear at 15ft."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,I mean even if black people could not have red hair.... it's a fucking MERMAID. They're cool with the fish tail but not the red hair? Nah. It's just an excuse to be racist IMO.
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"As a black person who has family members who are gingers, I find this funny. 

Malcolm X is one such black person with red hair (not my relative though.)"
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"She's a fucking mermaid. Why does any human biology apply to her in the first place? 

They're upset about her skin color. SHE HAS A FISH TAIL.

They're upset about her hair color. SHE'S A FISH PERSON.

They're upset about blah blah blah. SHE. IS. NOT. REAL.

What I think is funny is that it's always grown Men who complain about this shit. You're not going to see the movie anyway! Lol, gtfo of here."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"The racism is crazy online.

Ps— my grandfather was a red haired Native American"
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,I've know black/biracial people who had natural red hair. People need to stop being such dicks!
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"I hate the fact that the support option became the ""superdislike"" feature, it's so insulting, it's like; ""you should feel so bad you must be thinking about offing yourself"""
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"Lol, complaining about inaccurate hair color on a mermaid!"
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"I got massively downvoted for saying the same and that we redheads aren’t hurting for representation. People are really using the whole redhead thing as a shield. There are tons of things that differ from the original fairytale, including her hair color. From what I’ve heard the only reason it’s read in the first place was because Splash had only come out a few years before and the mermaid in that movie was blonde. And yes, my hair does look more vibrant underwater but that’s not a huge deal to me, or at least not a big enough deal for the vitriol we’re seeing."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,Her hair should look brown. Red is the first color you lose underwater. It should be a dull brown underwater and a vibrant red above water.
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"I also commented on someone's post saying that it is red, but just a natural shade of red lol.

And about the suicidal reports, what's up with those? I've gotten them twice in a single month, I don't get it."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"Black people also can't have fins or breath underwater, and THAT's what they claim is unnatural?  Any who says Herbal Essences doesn't have an underwater branch? 

I'm decades past the last time I saw a Disney fairy tale in a movie theatre, but I might go see this one.  It looks gorgeous."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,Wait til they find out black people can also be white lol
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,Black people most certainly can have red hair.  From what I remember it’s either someone with some European mixed in or they’re albino.  That said this is a mermaid so she could have purple hair and it would be just as real.  If the kids like the movie that’s all that matters.
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,They’re not trying to make that poor girl look like a carrot. I’m glad they didn’t
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,I am black and my grandmother had red hair. Bright red.
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,It’s a movie. They’re acting. Couldn’t just put on a wig?
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,Doy black people can't have red hair but they can have fish tails? Got it.
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,I Don't believe black people have  fish tails either
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,I'm just glad her hair is red. That's the iconic thing about Ariel to me well besides being a mermaid. I remember when they first announced she would be black soo many people were saying black people can't have long red hair and her hair has to be short black and kinky.
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"or also the fact that she lives at the bottom of the ocean where there is not much light, and therefore would have darker hair"

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"I mean I would say that Halle’s red hair in the trailer is as vibrant as a natural red you can get. I feel like people just have way too many critiques and emotions over a 30 second preview of a movie that isnt even fully edited or color graded and is still the better part of a year away. 

Like it’s not gonna look super saturated like a cartoon. It’s not a cartoon."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,Lol Malcolm X had red hair
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"My only issue was her singing, it didn’t really fit the mood of the trailer. Seemed like she was just showing off her singing rather than singing as the character."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,Black people can and do have red hair
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,Black people cant have fins either soooo….i don’t understand all the hate. It’s a fictitious being. Mermaids aren’t real.

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,These people need to fuck off to the sun.
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,Why would it matter if it’s not a natural shade for  black people anyway? In the same way her having dark skin shouldn’t be an issue because she’s a fictional mermaid then her having vibrant red hair shouldn’t be either lmao.

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"I agree, I wish her hair were more vibrant as well.

Does this mean you're racist? Nope. But it does mean you're saying the same things they say so there's no way to know what side you're on when hypercriticizing a black woman who is already getting so much hate.

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"This is what I feel most.

It feels like tokenization, in the sense they give us the same movie, make some small tweak, and positive or negative, they know it will generate attention, and sure enough its all people are talking about.

But does anyone need this story, again?  The same story?  The one retold a thousand times since the 1800s, many times by the same damn company producing the new one?

Go weird with it if youre going to do it.  Give us Little Mermaid a la Quentin Tarantino.  Give us R rated Little Mermaid.  George RR Martin Little Mermaid with black Ariel and Jack Black Ursula.

Produce something *different.*  Something with purpose or meankng that changes or evolves the source material in a relevant way.

Now of course the millions of racists out there are going to say this is why *they* dislike the movie, but we all know damn fucking well a remake with Taylor Swift in a red wig would produce *ambivalence* from the trolls, not troll activism in the form of bot swarming and downvoting.

So we can have both.  We can have a clearly racist minority of the viewing clearly throwing a tantrum about race, while at the same time this still being a lazy cash grab by an increasingly lazy and unimaginative corporation that would rather rehash than take on the risk of imnovating."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,This so much. Like it's so obvious all the live action remakes are just for cash grabs instead of making new contents.

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"i think that’s the point. people like you (and other causal viewers) may dislike the concept, but you’re probably not going to go out of your way to dislike the video. it’s weird that this remake has gotten the most dislikes out of all their most recent, crappy adaptations (like mulan, which was already hugely hated before it came out and it didn’t get nearly as many dislikes as this). at this point it’s hard to look at the intense reactions to this trailer as anything but racism."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"Honest question for you, then.  What of Disney’s movies WOULD translate well to live action?  They all more or less follow the same formula, are all colorful and vibrant and expressive, and feature memorable songs."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"Looks like a horror film tbh.

I also wanted more lights. Glowing fish etc.

What a let down before it's even out."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,Umm what? The only colorful parts of the animation were the “Under the Sea” musical number and when she was on land. Everything else was pretty blue and dark green for most of the movie with the occasional gold for when they were in the palace lol.
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"I don't understand why people keep making this comment. The scene they showed was a few seconds, not the trailer for the whole movie. There is a side by side comparison of the scene with the animated movie and it's identical. The premise of the scene seems to be she lives ""under the sea"" and she's reaching out to the surface where she prefers to be and is ""brighter."" They captured that scene well. I'm not sure why people are assuming the rest of the movie won't be vibrant."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"I chuckled at the audible big deep breath while underwater. But I agree, it's a colorful vibrant movie. Hopefully we see more of those colors."

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,Yeah I just think it’s another bad live action remake.
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,Agreed this really doesn’t translate well. The second she started singing I was like oh no this doesn’t work. I can suspend my disbelief with animation that the characters can talk and sing underwater but it just doesn’t work for me with live action. How is she breathing? How is sound traveling? It just broke my disbelief immediately.
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"This was my issue with Lion King as well. When I think of Lion King I think of bright, vibrant colors. The whole movies was a dingy brown grey I was so thrown off."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"I could get behind bioluminescence. The one thing that would've made the most sense in my opinion would be if she had short hair or dreads. I get it, it's Disney, it's meant to be magical and not real, but come on, if you're going to do a live-action remake that you want to be as believable as it can for a fantasy world, then why would you have long straight hair? Long hair isn't efficient for underwater living. I wanna see short hair that isn't going to get tangled up in a fish the moment you swim by it (using your long hair as a sort of fish net would be cool I guess, but think if how much stuff it's going to get caught on)."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"That scene from the animated movie is at night time. So this is a relatively realistic “night time under the sea” lighting situation. It’s also a rather sad song. She’s lamenting that she cannot have that which she most desires. I do think bioluminescence would be cool, but this scene has a different mood from sparkle."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"Colors and animation style/speed don't always translate to live action.

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,Plus: UNDA DA SEE!
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,The only reasons Disney keeps making these is the trend of these live action movies making a ton of cash from people who will simply see them without a second thought along with extending their copyright on these properties. Its going to be a sad decade or two for animation fans.
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"I mean, it's a teaser, I wouldn't assume the whole movie will be quite as murky, definitely won't be as vibrant as a cartoon though, but I'm fine with that."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,Disney Marvel sure hate vibrancy and saturation
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"Tbf, we're only seeing a brief glimpse of her underwater area.  I have a feeling the colors will be more vibrant when she visits land."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"I think the movie is going to be pretty vibrant. But the dark and dull sea is gonna contrast with the bright and vibrant land. In the animated movie, it never made sense to me why she would want to leave. The ocean looks amazing! Colorful, vibrant, fun! Every fish is bright! Every piece of coral is stunning! Why would she feel *such* a strong desire to go to the surface, when the ocean already has everything and more? Maybe it’s because I come from Broadway land or something, but I’m looking forward to this adaptation. We don’t have many stories that take place in the spooky sea; and if we do they’re horror movies. I think it’s gonna be cool. I don’t have much hope for Ursula though. I think *that* is what is gonna tank the movie."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"I’m hoping that a lot of them were merely pissed at how the film looks so dreary and dark.

I keep seeing montages of black kids reacting to the trailer with so much joy and surprise. That alone says how important representation is.

And yet, white people are kicking off at having one of the MAAAANY that they can pick to relate to no longer looking like them?

It's gross. I didn't have much opinion before tbh, aside from being annoyed a remake was happening which is sure to not stand up to the original. Now? I applaud it completely."

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"You’re kidding yourself if you think this is just about the little mermaid and skin colour. This is just another example of lazy, dispassionate film making from Disney. Instead of using their billions to take risks and fund actually creative, new and original ideas, they’re pouring it into resurrecting already great classic franchises, turning them into live action and reducing them to statements in whatever political argument is popular at the moment because that will obviously get the most attention. That’s what annoys me at least.

Aside from Pixar, Disney pretty much has no affiliation with productions that genuinely prioritize good storytelling anymore. For people that care about film making, Disneys massive influence is what’s hurting the industry today."

Representation is important and I think the benefits are still there regardless of intent.  Still, somehow I don't think Disney execs are altruistic in their motives here.

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"Exactly. Where are our Asian/Pacific Islander lead actresses/actors??? I would love to see a Filipino on the big screen! When Disney finally makes a movie about South Eastern Asians, it was just an amalgamation of a handful of SEA countries with no specific ethnicity. To me that just seems like a lazy approach. Like some kind of catch-all for Asians. I still loved Raya, don't get me wrong. She's my Filipino princess even though she's not a specific SEA ethnicity. Tbh, having a Filipino Ariel living off the coast of the Philippines would have been a great idea imo, the inspiration coming from the Filipina Marvel heroine Wave. 
Not surprised you got immediately shut down for asking that question. Asians are more underrepresented yet not much is being done to fix that."

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"Don't you think it's more valuable for a girl to have a princess that is alike, as an original? As opposed to say, a red hair and pale Pocahontas?"
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"> When the casting first broke I had a split second of disappointment that the live action version wouldn’t look like me. And then I realised that that was the situation thousands and thousands of black girls had growing up, except they didn’t have an Ariel then. So, I’m happy and honoured to share her.

This is exactly what happened with my red-headed wife. Ariel is, obviously, her favourite Disney princess, and for a moment she felt sad for having that ""lack of representation"" that made her feel so special when she was a kid, but then immediately realized that there was going to be a whole new group of young girls who will now feel represented because of this film, and it will help them just as the original helped her.

I don't think the movie looks good based on the trailer that we've seen (having nothing to do with Ariel's skin colour), but it's hard to argue with the representation and what it will mean to young girls (but goddamn if people are trying)."

It's not the race that matters, but the worlds perception of what Ariel was marketed as for the past 30 years- a light skinned, red headed mermaid with a green tail and purple bikini. Bailey having dark skin doesn't fit with the worlds image of Ariel that has been established and reinforced for the past 30 years.

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"Oh, which ones? Where have they expressed said issues?"
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"That would be interesting. I got real upset because some redditor said she should be pale because underwater= less sun= less melanin. Like bro, have you seen any marine animals? Most of the deep sea fish are black or dark colored and they see zero sunlight. If they were pale they'd stick out and get eaten. Most marine mammals are brown or gray or countershaded. Orcas are famously black and white.   Sorry for the tangent. 

 I'm trying to imagine what a ""realistic"" mermaid would look like but how far would we take the changes? Realistically, a half fish half mammal is impossible. It's got to be one or the other and the decision will impact almost every facet. A mammal with a few fish-like qualities seems more likely than the reverse so let's start there. If she is a mammal then probably no scales. There are some scaled mammals like the pangolin but none in the ocean. You're on the right track about hair. The mermaid would likely be bald. Sea otters have longish fir but they mostly reside on the surface. Seals have shorter fur, while whales are hairless. Unless our mermaid is covered in fur completely she'd be fully bald. Head fins seem unlikely. The only cephalic fins I can think of is the manta ray which uses them for feeding. 

As a mammal she needs to surface to breathe. So she probably isn't an ambush predator, she'd give away her hiding place whenever she runs out of oxygen. So how does she eat? Let's assume she's omnivorous as humans are. If she is a filter feeder like baleen whales she'll spend her whole day swimming horizontally. If she is a more conventional predator she'll also swim primarily horizontally. So her neck should attach at the back of her neck like most animals rather than the bottom like a human's. Otherwise she'll be blind above her. And if she is thus oriented she'll probably be countershaded. Light gray or white on her front/bottom and black/blue/dark grey/brown on her back/top. 

Back to the question of predation. How does she catch her prey? Do we assume she has ""human"" hands that are used for catching prey? If so she can't also use them to swim and her tail will need to make up for it somehow. Posterior limbs are used for steering while swimming in most species. If not she'll need a longer jaw and sharper teeth to catch fish. 

Does she have a blowhole? 

Idk, I'm probably wrong on a few points but I've already spent too much time thinking about this."

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"First, I think a musical draws in a different crowd. And second it isn't seen as a permanent the production version of the story.

That said, I don't think there would have been a big problem in 2000 with this. As others have said Life Size had a black lead Barbie (don't get into skin tone), a Cinderella live action had a black lead. Reddit will disagree, but it isn't about having a black lead/replacing a white character, it is about the cultural time. See comments here calling every dislike stemming from racism. Surely it isn't right, but it also surely isn't going to make people feel good about these changes when you are doing them to ""push an agenda"" instead of just doing them because ""they are the best actor/ress (not judging this casting).""

People think this is the way, but it will cause conflict as shown."

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"Disney don’t give a damn about the hate. The truth is people complaining about the live action movies, is people that never out grow their childhood fantasies. I’m never going to be more happy with the new movies than the ones I grew up loving but the little kids couldn’t care less about the old movies when they see the new ones (unless their parents teach them too) and Disney is making millions with them, that is why they keep doing them, so people can scream their hate all they want, nobody cares…"

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"You forgot Aladdin, arguably the worst of the bunch. And that's saying something, considering the quality of the others. 

It's just such an easy playbook to follow at this point. Grab existing popular IP, attach some big name actors, deliberately bait racists to stir up controversy online for free advertising, deliver sub-par product, and profit. And I mean *really* profit. The Lion King made over a billion dollars, despite having worse voice acting, worse singing, characters without facial expressions, and less interesting visuals than the original film. Technically, the  film is a marvel, and if it had to exist for Prehistoric Planet to get made, I'm totally okay with it, but it's a creatively devoid and soulless film. 

It would be nice if Disney used this live action remake trend to go back and make interesting changes or modernizations to films that either aged poorly (Peter Pan) or had potential but ultimately didn't come together (The Black Cauldron). But they just want to stick to basically shot for shot remakes that don't really capture the magic of the original and take the easy paycheque. I hope it bites them at some point."

You instantly get called racist when you say you prefer adaptations to more closely follow source materials. I think it's way more fun and interesting to see how good someone can follow source material.

Disney could have given them an original movie with an original character. Hell, even a mermaid, it's not like Ariel is the only one in Atlantica. But no. They get Black Ariel for two hours before the movie gets forgotten about like the other remakes. But hey, at least Disney got to pat themselves on the back for being so progressive and if the movie under performs they got a built in excuse ready to go. We know who the real winner is here and it's not those little girls."

I like the actress. It doesn't even look like she is in the water. It looks like a screen blue screen reflecting off her face. 






















Let's be real, The little mermaid dies. Also mermaids were killers. They would lore and drag sailors down to their deaths. Honestly though, seems like most kids stories were dark. I'm pretty sure one was raped. 



















But can we have an original black princess with her own plot. Can we not make old princesses black for the sake of it? Please????????????? 























What about a black princess inspired by the little mermaid or that would be interesting. As a Black woman, this is what I want to see more about. I want more stories that are based on original ideas. What about black american stories or even African fairytales? 






















I think a lot of people like me, excluding the racists, don't want to see another remake. The Lion King and Mulan were both failures. I know that this one will be one to.  Some movies should be left alone. All animated movies should not be made live-action.






















We have a live-action Pinocchio ( like no one asked for that). We have one hundred renditions of Cinderella ( only one I accept is Ever After). We have a Beauty and the Beast. Aladdin. Lion King. Mulan. Disney just stop...please.

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"Because representation matters. Little black girls didn’t get the opportunity to have an array of princesses that looked similar to them.

*You* may not care - but a lot of little black girls who see a beautiful, black woman with her natural hair on display, being vulnerable, innocent, rebellious and treasured (a well rounded character) - will care. It will mean the world to them. 

Especially since Halle herself is such an incredibly sweet, intelligent, good, funny, relatable young woman. With an amazing voice and acting skills who will do a great job, and not take anything away from the white original."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"There is no historic person in the story that can be branded as ""factually white"", and aside from that, if you retell stories, especially when your society is a cultural melting pot (USA), but just generally when cultural exchange happens and stories spread, people always have and always will adapt its contents to fit and represent their own.

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"See the problem is not representation of minorities. Make films about/with minority characters all day long, fine by me. Black panther was awesome, new characters in existing franchises like Matthias in Frozen 2, all fine, but why do you need to change the main character of a movie like that?

Disney could create new characters, princesses, heroes in all forms, shapes and orientations and that should be fine. Racists are mad here, for sure, but a lot of non racist people are also mad, not because she is black, but they changed the main character.
If Black Panther was Chinese in the next movie people would freak out as well. I don’t get the outcry in lightyear because his parents never played a role in Toy Story and so it is of no ones concern that his parents are lesbian, but Arial is a story about a white girl with vibrant red hair and to have that role played by Halle is just a desperate marketing stunt to include a black actress.

Let here play Tiana if she is so good or create a new role for here where she can shine, but don’t change an existing franchise just to include here."

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"Considering the original story came from Denmark, and the 1989 film “The little mermaid” has a white mermaid called “Ariel”, we can assume that in the live action called “the little mermaid” with the lead character called “Ariel” she would also be white. 

Mermaids are fictional characters and so they can be of any race. But “Ariel” was created as a white character. And now it seems they are switching her race due to the sake of diversity. Rather than creating an original black mermaid character with a different name, they chose to create a live action based on their previous film they made with the race of the character being changed. 

You’d expect the same reaction if a black guy was cast as Gandalf or if Ryan gosling as the black panther."

I’m personally going to remember how Ursula looked genuinely evil but knowing how CGI looks these days where it really isn’t that convincing I wouldn’t be surprised if this rendition of Ursula looks frightening and jarring (in a really bad way)"

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"All the remakes are soulless. I haven't even seen the trailer for this particular one and I already hate it, and it ain't for any casting reasons because I take no issue with that, I just take issue with the fact that it exists. These remakes are not only money grabs but they also take away a good chunk of what made the originals so appealing. The only worse stylistic change I can think of is the Ghibli movie Earwig and the Witch, which probably got Goro Miyazaki disowned"
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"I grew up with the original. i saw it in theaters as a kid 3 times ans is my fondest memory as a child.

but from a story structure standpoint I think the redo was better. Scar's manipulation of the Hyenas was fucking ON POINT and really made him a better villain. Now instead of just being a lion who was already friends with scavengers he was an opportunist and intelligent manipulator.

However - YES I do agree they should have thrown the whole song in there. i know why they didn't - it threw the pacing off a bit, but I would have preferred a song even at the expense of slowing that part of the movie down."

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,That would be ideal but having seen Chicago I only ever pictured Queen Latifah in the role. Melissa McCarthy is going to butcher it so bad I can just tell.
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"Ooh, also. Despite their age, Mason Alexander Park (recently played Desire in Sandman on Netflix) oooooooooozes the charisma needed to play Ursula. And they've got that non binary superhero energy."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"I think the issue might be that Ursula is a villain. Representation matters, but if they are going to put a drag performer in a children's movie it should be as a more positive character. Otherwise, it risks sending the message that drag queens are bad people."

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,If they're going to cast any drag queens as Ursula I'd go with Jinkx Monsoon. I don't think Latrice or Eureka has the acting chops for a movie like this.

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"As a trans person I think it was honestly the right call to not have a trans person play her.

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,I watched a local play where Ursula was played by my gf gay guy friend and he wore full drag and I swear it was one of the funniest performances I've seen.

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"My pick would be Alex Newell. They played Mo in Zoey's Infinite Playlist.

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,She auditioned but didn’t get it :(
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"Lizzo isn’t really drag. She’s *drag* in the sense of her image, persona, style, and obviously her influence, which seems to contradict my first statement. But she isn’t camp drag. She is Lizzo! Her Ursula would also be…Lizzo. Which I’m totally interested in actually, Ursula stealing Ariel’s voice through her flute. Melissa M is amazing, but I’m almost more worried about that. So much CGI and showing up and doing scenes totally alone. 

No one will ever be satisfied. I thought Billy Porter as the Fairy Godmother was gonna be epic… and it was beyond embarrassing. Disney needs formulaic and sage, with an edge. That girl playing Ariel has an amazing voice so I’m not worried about her at all. Minus she can’t sing or talk through most of it. Im kinda high and forgot what I talking about. Lizzo should’ve been Ursula."

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"Facts. Fuck palette swaps I want movies like Mulan, Coco, Moana, Soul, Princess and the Frog. I want original movies with culture and identity even if it’s not perfect it’s certainly better than this."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"I understand completely that Disney as a whole is some sketchy ass huge monopoly bs that has more skeletons in their closet than the Haunted Mansion.

But, there are entire groups with in Disney (obviously the majority being more on the creative side) that do in fact care about diversity, inclusiveness and cultural history. Some more than others and to different degrees. Took them almost 6 years to make Encanto. And one of biggest issues they faced was the pandemic preventing them from further research in South America. Though the biggest issues came from trying to convince Disney to approve a movie with an entire family as main characters. 

Disney and Pixar have really made a giant leap in terms of diversity and cultures. Compared to before that is. They still have a very long ways to go and it’s going to be a slow uphill battle. 

Especially when they’re pushing so hard for these bs “live” remakes that they’re hardly putting any effort into. But as you said, the ones at the top dgaf. They will ride on the nostalgic bandwagon for as long as they possibly can and to the point of live remaking every single movie they’re ever put out.  

Meanwhile there are a few teams that are doing great things at Disney and trying their hardest to come up with beautiful original stories that deserve to be told. Like Encanto, Soul, Moana, and Coco! 

They just take longer to make, get their budgets constantly cut, and then sometimes outshined and out marketed when Disney is shoving out 2 to 4 shitty live remakes every 12 months!"
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,They removed the songs to make it more realistic but then add that magic witch character. Ridiculous.
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"I feel bad for your watch party. Live action Mulan was not just the worst live action remake so far, it was also one of the worst movies that I have ever seen."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"I cancelled Disney+ after watching Pinocchio on Sunday (and watching several disappointing Disney/Marvel films last month).

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"All of the Asians around me were making a huge deal about doing watch parties, making tons of noise on social media, and the next day it was like that movie didn't exist.

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"But see they got you and all your Asian friends to watch it. They totally baited you.  They are going to keep doing it until people don’t get baited with “I have to watch this because of x”.  20 years ago it was chick flicks and male empowerment movies.  Then it was clear teenage female thirst triangles. Now it’s specific racial bait.  Same shit, different day."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"They also know they'll have a legion of morons criticizing the movie for being ""woke"", and that can be used to have fans broadly put down any criticism at all - because only the extremes are allowed to be discussed on the internet. 

Sometimes it feels like for every non-white guy put in a leading role they cut corners somewhere else, since they know the diversity stamp will be enough to get the same number of butts in the seats either way. Other times I remember that Disney is just putting out increasingly bland stuff in a shallow attempt to appeal to an as broad audience as possible. Kinda feels like the days of mainline Disney making memorable projects might be over."

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"Ugh the Mulan remake was absolutely soulless. They took a coming of age movie about a normal-ass but brave girl who uses her intelligence and training to solve a problem and turned it into “oooo look she’s special, she’s the chosen one”. LAME. Like that’s what made Mulan cool in the animated movie, she didn’t have special powers she was an underdog with a good heart!"
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"Seriously. Is it that hard to come up with something new (Disney's version of new, anyway)? I feel like there are enough legends and myths and fairy tales to keep making ""new"" movies off of forever."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"Many filmmakers have done their version of the story.   For a really great and bizarre take, see [Ponyo](https://youtu.be/pfGDfDjAdSE).  

About as far from a Scandinavian fairy tale as you can get."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"I mean I was hoping the live action “remakes” would all follow in the same vein as Maleficent and add different takes or perspectives to the stories we “know” and love. 

Not saying THIS should be the plot, but I’m just suggesting a possibility in making the story “interesting” or different. 

What if through her journey, Ariel realizes Triton is actually a terrible tyrannical ruler and after a ton of conflict and resolution Ursula and Ariel actually team up to beat King Triton and have Ariel rule Atlantica, allowing merpeople to co-mingle with humans and freely travel in and out of the ocean or some shit. 

Imagine if Beauty and the Beast was turned on its head and the Beast actually is a POS and Belle falls in love with like a cabinet or something by the end who was the Beast’s son who was always super kind and generous (obvs need more backstory here). 

What if we did Aladdin from Jasmine’s perspective? Or better yet Genie’s? What if instead we followed Genie on his previous wish stint and see how his lamp ends up in Aladdin’s hands? And then the sequel was “Aladdin” but from Genie’s perspective? 

What if Snow White is actually from the dwarves’ perspective and is called “The Seven Dwarves”.

There are just so many possibilities to interesting live-action adaptations than just remaking an animated film you already made again in live action. 

If you’re going to do that, just remaster or remake the original 2D animation with 2022 tech."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,This! I hated the idea before I saw the picture and realized anything was different about it.
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"It's the same thing. Pretty much every aspect they change in the remake will be compared to the original: why did they change it? Wasn't how it was good enough? Why they changing stuff?

But if they change nothing, why remake?

And yet they insist in remaking because $."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,Honestly I think it’s worse for diversity efforts if non-white characters are most often put in throw away cash grab movies. Put them in the good stuff.
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"I think the majority of people who don't like it, don't like it because it is a lazy, cynical, low effort move to appeal to diversity. It's not that she's not white, it's that it takes no effort. Being white wasn't a part of Ariel's identity (that I know of), so her being black isn't a big deal. It's just that instead of putting in the effort to create an interesting, more diverse, new character, they just race swap an existing one. 

And now, when it bombs, because the rest of the film is lazy and trash (see: Mulan etc), they can just point to the criticsm as ""racism"". It's a common tactic nowadays."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,I keep reading this sentiment but.. looking back at the little mermaid it's really not that amazing of a film anyways. Most Disney movies aren't pinnacle animation. Maybe for back when they were released but their are so many movies out now that are just so much better.
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"I think that’s the problem, I don’t personally have an issue with her being black, but when that’s what takes the front seat to a faithful recreation of the movie it makes it worse. It’s worse because it (like all/ most of the recreations) haven’t been fully focused on recreating, it’s being righting past “wrongs” they made in the original movies that weren’t really issues in the first place. If Ariel was white, the “woke” crowd  would be mad she wasn’t black, if she’s black the “anti-woke” crowd is mad, but really it’s just that the movie will probably suck just like all the other new versions."

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"I hate Disney cause they keep pulling this cheap ass tactic of “pretending inclusivity” for free publicity. Disney execs don’t give a shit abt inclusivity, they just pull the most “subtly outrageous” PR stunt, to get people talking about their new shitty film to get cheap publicity. Lets not count the people who go watch the movies just to “stick it to the whiners”. Notice how there’s always some controversy that sticks out like a sore thumb on recent Disney movies, if they didn’t carry all the controversy noise, all these cash-grab remakes would go under quietly and unnoticed like cheap cash-grabs would."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"I did not think that trailer was as low effort as everyone else did.

That’s what I’m excited about it. Also, please put Ariel’s bangs back please and thank you lol"
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"Disney has rarely ever made creative originals. The little mermaid is an Americanized version (i.e. she gets the prince and doesn’t die unhappy) of the HC Andersen classic, and basically every famous Disney story is an adaption of classics to American sensitivities."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"I’m glad there are a lot of other opinions similar to this here. To put on my tinfoil hat for a second, it’s almost a perfect stir-up-controversy studio plan because (other than the obvious of it being talked about a ton)  if I say the movie looks bad, dislike it after watching or even had just hit the button on the trailer,  I’m grouped in in with wacko outrage nuts  and racists. 

It’s like when Elizabeth banks (IIRC) said people disliked and didn’t see the ghostbusters reboot because they hate women. Nah the movie was just a massive stinker, sorry!"
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"I don't usually like race swaps because sometimes they don't make sense and feel cheaper than having an original character belonging to the minority/less represented group in question.

But Ariel is like, the most swappsble character in existence. She is from the sea, she doesn't belong tona particular human people of culture. Yes, the original tale is Danish, but in-universe the characters are meant to be otherworldly"
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"I think hate is a strong word. From what I've seen people just heavily dislike it (obviously there's racists too but they're a minority on here or atleast i hope so) which is my take on this. 

The decision to make Ariel black was extremely stupid in my opinion but If the movie is *really* good (or atleast just as good as the og) then there's not much to complain about. Judging from other live action remakes though it's not looking well so obviously the skin colour chamge compounded with the movie *probably* being bad is going to get people to talk negatively about it."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,You are getting nit picky remember this is the same company who called Lion King live action which I'm about 99% sure there was 0 living things in the movie.
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"I wasn't a fan of the CGI beast's man face. I watched Belle (anime movie) and I really liked that so it's not impossible to just do a new interpretation of a movie the live action Disney ones are just their own movies again but worse. In my honest opinion they feel like if you've watched the movie when it came out and they have you remake it from memory most times. A few things change, but not enough to warrant watching it over the original animated version."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,This is a good way of seeing it. It's always cashgrab this and soulless that but meanwhile there's literally hundreds of people working on these things and I'd argue most of them actually care and want to make something good and fun. I'll be looking for their influence.
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,I think it’s a team giving their best effort on a low-effort concept they were told to work on
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,But we’ve had fairytales with characters being played by people of color before. There’s the Cinderella movie Brandy did in 1997. Her prince was Asian. Her parents: father was white and mother black (played by Whoopi Goldberg). And the movie is beloved. I never once heard the word woke back then or any backlash at all. I don’t understand why it’s different now except it becoming more common
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"Same for Rings of Power. It doesn't live up to the source material and for such a high budget, it has some embarrassing ass cgi. But they can call fans racist and sexist criticizing."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"[It's absolutely is ""diversity dollars"".](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xU1ffHa47YY)  This is what Disney does with its live-action remakes now.

In fact, this whole campaign of news articles about the ""race issue"" is marketing to them."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"WHY WHY does everyone think this is solely for the race card?

There’s an entire generation of women out there who grew up and saw this movie.

Now there will be an entire generation who will get to experience a similar story in the same “universe” but with a character who isn’t white.  It means more black parents and kids who can feel included.

It’s like no one understands part of the issue with systemic racism.  the lack of inclusion in society.  Doesn’t just mean college and loans and financing.  It means having hero’s your kids can relate to, can look up to, who look like them, or suffered the same shit as they may be currently going through.

Fuck so many people here are out of touch."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,That’s pretty much Disney in a nutshell and always has been.
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,It’s Disney knows if they try to add diversity by making a movie based off of a story from a non European culture there is a risk that nobody will care. By swapping the race in a fairy tale from Northern Europe it at least makes sure they will get a bunch of media attention from making people mad and that will turn into views.
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"Yeah pretty much most of the straight to DVD sequels were pretty shite. I did enjoy the lion King ones and the Lilo and Stitch one, but the good ones are usually an exception of the rule. All the live action movies are usually different, but in an awful way Mulan removed all the music which 100% honest?  There was not a single bad song and the fun of it got removed, Lion King became a pretty dull slog of a movie removing/minimzing Be Prepared the best song in it. The absolute only good live action one was Jungle Book i watched it twice it was fun."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"There’s a difference between those direct to DVD movies and these live action movies pushing for theater release as if it’s a brand new movie.

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,I mean yes most people don't care for the straight to DVD sequels. The 2nd Little Mermaid was not the worst of them. But it wasn't good either (also it was just a copy of the first one plot wise but in reverse and sans prince).
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"Thing is, you couldn't make Moana and have it be about a white girl (although 30-50 years ago, that's exactly what would have happened).  

With the Little Mermaid, her skin color has nothing to do with the storyline.  The original cartoon was a bastardization of H.C. Andersen's fairytale, it's not like it wasn't already taking a Danish fairytale and turning it into something mainstream western viewers found palatable in the 90s, so now Disney is doing the same thing.  H.C. Andersen's tale wasn't about a white mermaid swimming around in the Caribbean with her Jamaican crab buddy."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"Really trying hard to find something, I honestly couldn't care less I'm probably not even going to watch it I've watched Lion King live action and Jungle Book and Dumbo after those I've been done with anything they make live action.

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,It's a passive aggressive way for them to tell you to kill yourself without violating reddit rules.
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,That has gotten alot more common recently. Pretty annoying actually lol. I’m always like “wait a minute am I depressed. What did I write?” And then realize it’s just someone being a dick lol
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,Yeah I got reported for that the other day. What a bizarre thing to do
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"Ah yes, the classic suicidal report problem, I've been reported as well. I'll probably be reported for this one too."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"I think its bots when you say the word as an auto trigger just in case.

if its wrong 10,000 times for every one its right, the cost of being wrong it nothing."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"If you contact the mods they can open a ticket with admins. The admins can see who sent you the suicide alert, and if they think it's malicious or see that user doing it a lot, they will perma ban them site wide."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,Reddit really needs to start punishing people who abuse that feature.
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,Same here. It was around the time I was calling out assholes during the whole Roe v Wade thing.
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,“First time?”
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"I've gotten reported as suicidal multiple times. I'm like probably, but I'm not actually gonna do it."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,I personally think it’s not accounts - they report you and likely that’s the only option they can choose without getting flagged themselves
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,Reddit would do well to ban IPs from people who abuse that. I was reported 3 times for one post. It's ridiculous how easily it can be abused.
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,Always one of the funniest ways to troll. I always laugh when I get them.
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,I also got reported recently for being suicidal and have   No clue why. Weird
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,Don't mind them. People are pricks.
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,Isn’t that ridiculous?  That happened to me and really pissed me off - it should have made me leave Reddit!
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"I got one a few months ago. Never knew what it was for, but uh, interesting that I made them so mad."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,I got reported for that too. I don’t get what the point is? Like???
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"Same, I was like wtf? All I said was something regarding cowardly gop tactics and fake outrage"
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,I got reported for being suicidal because I was aghast that anyone could divorce their spouse and dove their children in Stardew Valley.
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"If you make a comment about suicide, don't be surprised if you get reported. Either by bots or simply because you're putting ideas in people's heads. I wonder if I'll be reported now."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,They do this because it's against TOS to tell someone to kill themselves.
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,It helps racists feel like they did something about their inability to murder you. Poor stupid pathetic racists.
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,Happened to me before. No idea what a posted to trigger someone so much.
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"Just got [one](https://ibb.co/p6D9TtM) a few hours ago after someone told me not to get so offended online and grow a spine.

Grow a spine like them, where they are so offended they go to people's profiles and click the option to send it lmao."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"I’m collecting suicide reports like infinity stones.  For some seemingly innocuous arguments, too."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,Reddit perma bans from the entire web site for that and they're extremely aggressive with it. You have to report the help message though.
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,I had a spate of those reports. I'm not so I turned the function off.
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"They want to hurt you, but the very thing that stops them getting the absolute shit beat out of them eventually, being on the internet, also stops them doing much.  


Everyone laughs about it, but at the end of the day it's a directed, intentional act of malice from a weakling scumbag who only wasn't violent because there was no way for them to use violence. If they had the power, they would harm you."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,That's a weird way to report someone because you don't agree with comment.
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,Is that what that's about? I'll randomly get these suicide watch messages and was always confused.
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,Congrats!
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,I once got reported for being suicidal for stating that a mass child molester should die in a gruesome fashion.
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,You can now report those suicide hotline messages as harassment and Reddit will take some action
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"First time?

Welcome to Reddit.

I am on the Fortnite sub and get reported all the time when I say something about the state of the game that people don't like."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,I'm going to fucking kill myself.
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,I've had the same thing happen after arguing with a right wing nut. That should be a permanent ban.
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"I did too. I hadn't even had a conversation with anyone or even had a reply. Just a bunch of no vote comments for weeks, about mundane shit. When I saw the suicide thingy I was so confused"
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,I get them often. Especially when calling out sexist and misogynistic men. They cant handle being told they’re wrong
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,You watched the trailer correct?? And you're not suicidal
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"You can report the reporter, and they *should* have their account banned."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"I got that a couple times, but just laughed it off. Yeah I wanna die, but I aint giving anyone the satisfaction."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,Yeah welcome to the club. Happened to me when I argued with someone in the conservative post that made it to popular....
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,How does being reported for being suicidal work? Like what is reddit going to do?
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,glad I'm not the only one that happened to lol
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,I got banned from an entire subreddit I’ve never posted on for being a “biological terrorist” like… Wha??  Lmfao
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"I got reported like that last night, I have no idea why"
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,I hope you’re doing ok today
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,That happened to me too. I also have no idea which comment I made prompted someone to report me.
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"Yeah they just do it when the want to tell you ""go die"". 

These are not the smartest people, be gentle with them"
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,yeah i'm really hoping it's just a fluke from the trailer! the colors in the trailer honestly felt very muted in general so perhaps it was just because it was supposed to be night time
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,I am a little worried they are going too hyper real like they did with the lion king. It'll be disappointing if it lacks the character and color of the original in the same way Favreau's Lion King did.
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"Yup, my only issue with it is her hair, that should be everyone’s only issue. Nobody should be complaining about skin color"
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,Honest question - how can it look vibrant and still not look weird with her skin tone? Or maybe I just haven’t seen a black person with vibrant red hair?
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"If sonic is any example, there’s still a lot of time to change hopefully"
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,Red doesn’t show up underwater.
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"From the screenshots, I assumed it was bad makeup/bad color editing, which I still kinda stand by, but you’re totally right about the “environment” they were going for. It’s absolutely because it was supposed to be a *nighttime* scene."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"Yeah, the scene was totally dark in her grotto and I’m sure it will be more vibrant on land under the sun"
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,I was thinking it might be because it’s underwater… when you scuba dive red is one of the first colors to completely disappear and look murky brown underwater. It has to do with the way the light spectrum is filtered out the farther down you go.
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,I like the natural red hair! That crayola red shit didn’t even match her eyebrows!
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,I def don't like how every movie in the world (America) these days seems to be literally dark. Even the new Jursassic remakes vs the originals. Maybe to help cut costs of CGI but damn dude
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,Part of me thinks the darkness is intentional just to make all the CGI look a little better.
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"Somebody mentioned it was supposed to be a night-time shot, which makes more sense if it's true."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"I mean, yeah.. it was the sunken ship stuff, which is a kinda dark scene, and also.. it's pretty dark under the sea! I thought it looked really good actually. Way more realistic, and maybe they're going for a little more realism. It spooked me too btw, deep dark water and the things in it is like my only phobia haha."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"That’s what I thought. The trailer gave me “this movie is going to suck” vibes, I wasn’t even minding the casting choice."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"If you look at the scene from ""Part of Your World"" in the original animation, the grotto she's in is dimly lit and not very colorful."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"I had a look after reading this comment. I absolutely love the way the underwater world looks (though I admit, I adore underwater settings so I am rather biased). But it definitely didn't look like a Disney film. I guess they tried to keep it more realistic and kind of overshot that mark, forgetting that Disney films are supposed to feel like they are full of life. Or it was a conscious decision of course, in which case it's a weird decision."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"It wasn't a trailer...it was a teaser. It's impossible to know the lighting situation in the entire movie from such a small snippet, no?  I highly doubt that if you really went to the bottom of the ocean that it would be bright and colorful with sun shining through.  But I can't be to sure as I have never been to the bottom of the ocean. Surely in the scenes that she gets her legs and is frolicking on the beach, the sun will be present lol but maybe I'm just too logical. I'd imagine that the live action version of a cartoon would look a little different. Right? I got a caricature drawing done of me and my family and I must say I looked different than I do in real life. 

Some of y'all are doing a lot of mental gymnastics to avoid the actual issue you have with this movie that you have certainly not seen in its entirety lol.  We saw a glimpse of two characters in this teaser which was Ariel and the ocean and you're miraculously able to form such strong opinions.  Maybe wait until you see some above ocean scenes, Ursula, Eric, Sebastian, Flounder, like literally any other scene than what was shown.  If I remember correctly, that particular moment is when Ariel is in her hidden cave playing with her human treasures.  So is it possible that her being in the gloom of the cave under the ocean might be dark? Like seriously....just say what the real issue is at this point lol. Stop dancing around your truth! 

The same conversation was had when they announced a Black/Puerto Rican boy as the new Spiderman...turned out to be an amazing film that meant a lot to a lot of brown and black children including my son (who is half white btw).  Representation matters.  Give it an actual chance."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"The original story, before Disney got ahold of it, was dark"
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,To be fair color is actually muted under water the deeper you go and the coral shots looked like they could be partially real but I wasn't really looking that hard.
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,My historically accurate mermaid lore only has them eat the flesh of sailors.
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"My dude, there are grown-ass men on TikTok arguing that it’s scientifically impossible for mermaids to have dark skin because the sunlight doesn’t penetrate deep into the ocean. 

Let that sink in."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"Did they have the same issue with The Lighthouse?  I mean, who’s to say that’s an anatomically correct mermaid vagina?"
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"Well, since their problem seems to be the “natural skin color” of mermaids i cant expect much better from them sadly :("
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,I wasn’t aware that manatees had hair at all
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,They are literally fantasy creatures lol
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,The guy has over 1k upvotes and tons of comments for whining about a mermaids hair color. Gotta love it!
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"I mean I feel like it's pretty obvious that no one is talking about the ""natural' hair color of mermaids.

They're talking about the actual character of Ariel and her history as a character."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,People see a tanned Japanese high school girl in anime and call her an African American. It's like their entertainment is being insufferable.

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,Yea these ain't even real. Mermaids ain't real y'all. They are not like Santa.
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"I dont care about this movie, or the original animated one, but just because something contains some element of ""fantasy"" doesn't preclude people from complaining about changes to the source material."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"I mean, it’s kinda dumb, but it’s not about the hair of mermaids in general but the hair that one specific mermaid who’s trademark look is pretty much bright red hair"
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"It's uncanny. Like a white person with dark skin, or a black person with blond hair"
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"> i mean, seriously are people really going to discuss what is the natural hair color of .. mermaids??

It's racist code. Kinda like all the hoopla over The Rings of Power and how the black, female dwarves didn't have ""beards"" sent fanboys into a week of tirades about ""beards""."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"My issue with it is that it would seem someone decided she had to have red hair and the actress' natural color wasn't good enough. Unless the color of the character's hair is crucial to the story, leave it alone. Like if the character is supposed to have long hair (Repunzel), then yeah, she has to have long hair, but the color, it could be any color and the story would still work."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,Yeah the original had Ariel in constant excruciating pain when she got legs and she never got the love of her life. Also the original she dies and becomes sea foam but we both know this isn't the story everyone wants to see. They want Disney's The Little Mermaid with fantasy bright red hair.
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,My mom's argument was that black people can't have red hair and that's why she was upset. So I asked her what race has natural fire engine red hair.
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"It's not the same. Animators usually do the complete opposite of realism for it to look good (Looney Toons, for example! The exaggerate how characters move, walk, etc.)

Live-action, on the other hand, needs to have tons of realism (good CGI) unless you want to creep people"
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"i know, my issue is that they went naturally shaded in the live action rather than vibrant and bright."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"That is one of  the problems with moving from cartoon to live action.   Cartoons can do all sorts of things that don't trigger a ""that is creepy"" response in the brain."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"Yes! Given how “realistic” they’re making the ocean scenes, I wonder if her hair will look redder when she comes up to the surface?! Would be a very cool detail. 

Speaking of her hair, I also dig how much it resembles surfer hair, with the partial dreadlocks and texture. I haven’t liked a single live action Disney remake except Cinderella, and The Little Mermaid was my crack when I was a kid. But I’m going to see this in theaters. It looks awesome from that clip."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,yeah someone else mentioned that below as well and i didn't realize that! i don't live near the ocean and don't really engage in a lot of discussions or research related to it so that's good to know! hopefully once she goes on land it'll be brighter to account for that
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"Be pretty cool if they used that. Like a reveal of her swimming up into view and the hair gains saturation until just pow, redhead Ariel."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,Yes this is a very scientifically accurate movie portrayal of a mermaid…
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"Dude, didnt you know. Black people can't have mermaid tails. No one can. (/s)."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,The craziest thing for me is what makes her a black person other than the color of her skin? Even if black people never had red hair black mermaids might
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,Or people wanted to see an animated character they grew up loving brought to life and instead Disney is using the live adaption to stir the pot using racial controversy as that's the latest trend

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"Is the fish tail red, though?"
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,I would be interested in what the most invested demographic - I assume 4 to 6 year olds - have to say after seeing it.

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"I've seen black folks with red hair. Not something that really enters the brain. It just looks natural.

Until you get some of those Latino gingers. That engages the pity center of my brain tbh"
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,When I live in Africa I saw some people with red hair but at that time I assumed it was because of the serious form malnutrition. But now that I think of it I don't recall them having the other symptoms. But that was over a decade ago.
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"I’m saying though. When it comes to skin tone and hair color, we probably have the most variations. I have two fraternal twin sisters, one of which is chocolate with dark brown hair and another who’s like walnut colored with natural brownish blonde hair."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"Wait, what?

Did not realise that at all. (Malcolm X having red hair)."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"The author of the original story doesn't say what her hair color is and she doesn't even have a name. So Disney makes up a bunch of details for the first movie and people are fine with it. Then, Disney makes up some more details and now all of a sudden it's bullshit."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,People just want to be outraged about something
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,Thanks. You saved me the time of having to type
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,Feel like those people got bored with “black elves don’t exist in LOTR” and re-boarded the Hate Train only to stop at The Little Mermaid.
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"Gotta remember these are the same people who think they can see chromosomes, dna or bone structures like mega Superman or someshit.

They simply aren't living in this reality anymore. That's all it is. there's no logic behind it, it's so disconnected from reality it's actual insanity at this point."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"Whales, sea lions, dolphins, orcas, walruses. None of these are pale skinned outside of a couple outliers like belugas or Amazon river dolphin."

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"Why couldn't she be the other kind of mermaid, with the fish part on top, and the lady part on the bottom?"
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"People are upset that a character they know has been changed. Idk why people act shocked when this happens. It's not about whether a mermaid can be X Y or Z. It's that Ariel, to a lot of people, is already a character who is recognisable.

Personally idgaf about that character or this movie. I was already an adult when the Disney film came out. But I can understand why people do."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,Just because someone doesn't like does not mean they are racist.
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,Malcolm X.   IIRC at one point in his life his nickname was “Red.”

I've got some bad news for you."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"I think it's just the easiest way to block someone. They want to report without having a good reason so they use that one instead, likely because people complain often."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,Because it’s a huge part of Ariel we all recognize her by the fire truck red hair.
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"I mean it’s obvious that the problem is her tail is an inaccurate accurate color. That tail looks nothing like the color of Ariel‘s tail, and it has way too many fins. Why aren’t they complaining about that?"
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"She's not even the only Disney princess with red hair. Merida, Ariel, and Anna have red hair. And expanding just slightly Jesse from toy story, Mrs Incredible, Jessica rabbit, misty from pokemon, Jessie from pokemon, etc. 

But also... the Ariel cartoon you know and love... still exists."

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,It would be really neat if she ended up having the bright red hair above ground.

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"there is nothing biologically based on reality about mermaids. I don't see a point in saying which colors are unrealistic, it's all unrealistic"
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,Yup! And if you look at the movie poster it looks way brighter when she’s out of the water.
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"Red is black at depth.   Blacker than black, apparently.  Hence the reds in some deep critters."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"This is where I thought they were going with this in the trailer. 

Underwater everything will be muted and we'll see her in her full color in the  
Part of Your World rock with waves crashing on it scene. I can see them even having her save the prince and interact with him on the beach at night instead of night/day so they delay showing her full colors until that song so it's an even more emotional/powerful moment."

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,Hook was perfect. It’s still one of my fave movies of all time. Disney needs to do more adaptations like that.

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,Copyright last for like 75 years and Disney is the main proponent and lobbyist that is trying to extend their stranglehold on IP even more. This is about $$$.
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"It doesn't work like that.  For example, Winnie the Pooh is now public domain, as of last year (95 years since his original publication), but only the Winnie the Pooh and characters as exhibited in the 1926 books.  The newer stuff doesn't reset or claim anything, but just creates additional copyright dates for those changes.  

Similarly, unless there are legal changes (possible, because Disney is the biggest driver of copyright extension laws, due to this), Mickey Mouse will be public domain in 2024, but only as he appeared on Steamboat Willie.  Though in a complex addition to this, they may be able to make a trademark claim on that, due to their use of that version of Mickey in modern branding, and trademark doesn't have an expiration date (which may be what you're thinking of, but this doesn't require a movie or other art work, just its use as a trademark."

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,I dislike all disney live action adaptations equally
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"Bingo.

The people who have legitimate gripes with maybe the direction of the movie aren’t going out and downloading an extension to dislike it.

They aren’t taking the trailer and remaking it with a white mermaid and trying to pass it off as not racist.

The deeper bowels of this thread are honestly sickening.  

I’m all for constructive criticism like lighting or the cgi quality - but literally none of the loud complainers have anything of substance to say.  Aka closet racists."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"There's still a good portion of the internet which is very reactionary to diverse casting and sees any race changes from previously white characters as forced diversity, unfortunately"
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"Lmao racism, i am almost as dark as halle baley and i am european so there is no b/w culture war over here - its obvious that disney is doing this to bait - all in all this increases profits, the outrage is PR too - and in china f.e. they dont do this shit, they just pretend to be woke in the west"
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,It's not racism.
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"How would people react if they do a live action of a movie where the lead is already a POC and cast someone white to play them?

Would all the people screaming about it also be racist or would the people complaining about the people complaining about Ariel be hypocrites?"
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,Everyone is racist but me -  ^ this guy
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"I disagree with the last sentence.  
Sure, for a lot of people changing the race of Ariel will be the reason to press that dislike button, but Disney specifically is getting a ton of hate (And a lot of it well deserved, I say) for various other things.  

And if disliking the choice of what Ariel's hair looks like is legitimate criticism, does disliking that the new one has different skin colour have to be only comming from racism?  
(It is. but technically it doesn't have to be and I can pretend that all those haters are just disliking the visual differences for their own artistic preferences of the previous work)"
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,That's a miserable assumptions to make
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"I’m not sure why it’s that weird, these films are already very disliked and they added another layer on top of it of swapping the race of the character, which I don’t care about but plenty of people freak the fuck out when a white person plays anything that should be another race. 

ie. I don’t think a significant amount of people care that she is black, they care that her race was swapped at all.

If they wanted a black main character, they should have just made a live action princess and the frog, that would actually be doper because they could the original voice actor for the bad guy to play him."

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,Really? Cause we've been burned before THREE times now. I think the hatred is well earned. Your seriously defending Disney and it's capitalism ways?
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"You think there wasn't racist thinking on Disney's part? The change is calculated. The question is whether or not the change matters in the scheme of things -- the US is not the whole market, and the rest of the world is becoming richer. If Disney truly wanted to be altruistic, they would have made the Little Mermaid noticeably Native American, the most underrepresented and oppressed group in the United States by far."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,">people like you (and other causal viewers) may dislike the concept, but you’re probably not going to go out of your way to dislike the video.

I disagree. I hit dislike or like on stuff all the time. It's also usually that I'm more inclined towards hitting dislike on something I dislike than hitting like on something I liked. I think what you push here is a line they want you to buy into that a lot of corporations have been pushing to try and brush off any criticism from fan communities for their shitty products. 

And I'm real serious about this. Pay attention to where these stories of ""racist fans react to black casting"". Because I'll tell you this I either don't see them or see them far far less when the actual show is good. Right now in front of all of our faces is the truth of this situation. House of the Dragon has quite a few prominent roles cast to black actors but that has received nothing but praise from fans. Meanwhile Ring of Power has done the same thing, and the only fucking story you hear from that is ""racist fans review bomb RoP!"" Maybe some of that is racially motivated, this *is* the internet and you have to acknowledge that that shit will be there, but when it's something like that or something like this video where it got 1.5 million dislikes, then maybe, just maybe it's something more than that. And paying outlets to push stories about it being racist fans is just a vain attempt to try to get some backing for their product do to meta aspects."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"They just voiced their dislike of the movie preview, why wouldn’t they click the dislike button lol? I think if you were young enough to see and like the first movie, the remake movie is an easy thing to hate. Same with the lion king and all their other remake garbage. Then their attempt to win a social brownie with all their race games is just pathetic."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"I don't like any of the live action adaptations, but I will say it feels like there's a double standard with this film with people saying nobody should care about the color of Ariel's skin. The Little Mermaid is a Dutch fairytale. Can you imagine how much outcry there would be if a movie studio took a non-white story and made the main character white? Or if Disney remade Mulan, Aladdin, or Princess and the Frog with a white protagonist? I feel like there would be a lot of overlap between the people making fun of others for being upset over The Little Mermaid and people who would be upset about whitewashing.

I don't really feel like diving into getting butthurt over whitewashing, blackwashing, or any other kind of washing. What I will say is I wish Disney would just drop the remakes and make more *original* films with protagonists of any race their hearts desire.

But Disney is a corporation that just cares about money, and these remakes are basically guaranteed box office successes. So it won't stop any time soon."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"I just struggle to see this as anything other than pandering or going for the controversy just for views. Ariel is a pretty well established character. Sure, mermaids aren't real, they can be whatever color and all that, but Ariel is a ditzy ass pasty redhead. I guess we can race/gender/sexuality/etc swap any fictional character, it just feels like lazy pandering. I really hope the writers are better than recent live action adaptations, otherwise this is just a cash grab."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"For starters, and full disclosure, I'm white. Now, to play devil's advocate....

I dislike it because there is no need to remake all of these things, period. The fact they'll remake things and then change genders, race, etc. just comes across as shameless PR, digging for goodwill. I liken it to coffee places that have a seperate receptacle for their cups and 'litter'. It all ends up in the same place, but it gives the appearance of them doing good. If these studios were sincere, they would be producing original content featuring these minority characters. I'm sure there's no shortage of people writing these stories."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"Do you actually know it got more dislikes? According to the title, the other movie trailers could also have thousands of dislikes, but this one was _viewed_ more than any other."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"Not the person you asked but I think the early 2000s Disney movies could work. Treasure Planet and Atlantis for example. At their core they are kid friendly action adventure movies and there's plenty of live action movies like that. Also Lilo and Stitch I think could work. The family stuff, which I'd say is the heart of the movie, didn't need to be animated and Stitch could work as a CG character."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,Under the Sea is the only part of the movie most of these people remember
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"The trailer was all about mystery and darkness.

Hahahahahaha. Ha. No. This is a *Disney* Live Action Remake we're talking about.

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,The OG little mermaid was in Denmark so probably a white mermaid but at the same time mermaids aren’t real so who cares. Not sure why I’m even commenting TBH.
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"Hold on now, if you're gonna use real world logic, living next to the equator is not what gives you dark skin.  Living with high amounts of sun exposure does.

On the surface, living near the equator means getting more sun.

Only problem is that the little mermaid lives under the ocean where there probably way less sun exposure.

Therefore by your own logic the little mermaid would probably not be black.

My bet is that since shes a mermaid she would be either blue or grey like sharks"

I don't think fish deep in the ocean are getting a whole lot of sunlight to darken their skin. If anything, it would push them towards being pale."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"Mate, people have darker skin color because they've always lived under the scorching sun of the equator and their melanin evolved to protect them from the sunrays.

Mermaids live under the sea. You know what blocks sunrays? Water. By all means the mermaid would be the whitest girl alive assuming mermaid evolution operated under the same logic as human's."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"I mean if you want to play that game, Mermaids are aquatic and live deep under the sea. Just living in slightly less bright and cooler climates humans evolved white skin. Imagine little sun they would get down in Atlantis or wherever they are living. Black skin would be illogical.

Let's not try to use arguments like biology to describe mermaids..."

I worry more that the movie will suck and so those people will keep disliking the new Ariel movie (and the character) and the decision to make Ariel black will bring more division than union."

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"The criticisms of Rings of Power are pretty spot on.

People can dislike a show without being racist."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"But that’s not even true…the racists are the minority. I’ll tell you 100% I’m not racist, but sacrificing lore and storytelling for a random black elf or dwarf is just corporate pandering. In rings of power for example, they could have just made all the Harfoots black. That would have been great and it makes way more sense. Instead a tribe that is extremely anti-social and not trusting of outsiders has five different skin tones? It makes no sense. 

But because of this critique people are racist. It’s so fucking dumb."

Step 4: enjoy full censorship of all criticism of your objectively terrible and unoriginal show, as well as advertisement from the stupids that need to virtue signal or just be mad about something on the internet."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,What would you say if Mulan or Moana was played by a white person in a live action remake?
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"> Between this and the Rings of Power idiocy it is truly sad to see just how alive and well racism is in this country.

Why is racism not an issue for House of the Dragon? Why am I not seeing stories being promoted about how all the fans of that show are racist too? That show took an all white fantasy cast and put black actors into some of its most prominent roles. Why isn't a narrative being pushed about racism towards that shows low reception? Oh wait, it doesn't have a low reception, it is actually a good show. So even what fans would judge it purely on the race of the actors aren't really relevant because all the ones who aren't racist outweigh them. GoT and LotR probably have a lot of overlap when it comes to fandom honestly. So where are all those racist fans review bombing that show? 

It's because this only happens with shitty shows or movies. It's a way for corporations to deflect and hopefully secure some support just from people ""fighting racism"". Same thing happened with Sandman. It has a very prominent black cast and it was well reviewed by fans regardless of that and despite some racists even complaining about it before hand. 

So yeah maybe all this needs to be re-examined a bit instead of just buying into the line that corporations are trying to feed us. All this is doing is preventing any honest discussion about any of this stuff."

Strictly speaking, Jet Li, Tony Leung and Chow Young Fat should not count - because they were already HUGE stars in Asia when Hollywood put them into movie for easy cash grab in Asia.  

Michelle Yeoh is also like that: she was already huge in Asia when Hollywood finally put her in a movie.

BTW, Tony Leung has never led a Hollywood movie.

Bruce Lee, Sima Liu, Lucy Lou, Awkwafina and Constance Wu are the only ""made-in-Hollywood"" Asian leads in your list, (but Awkwafina has always played supporting instead of a lead.)"
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"Yes, there are other characters now. There weren’t when I was a child; my point was that I’m one of these people that keep getting held up as the person they’re defending (“what about those kids that got bullied for having red hair and this character was important representation for them?!”) and yet I can see why it’s ok. 

I agree re the original drawing still existing. I’d also go as far as to say the original drawing will also still be held up as the ‘dominant’ version; no one really thinks of Naomi Scott when someone says Jasmine, or Lily James when they say Cinderella - they think of the more established cartoon version that’s been and still is slapped on every single piece of merchandise. The point being, there’s literally no reason to be *so* agitated. She’s not being replaced, even in popular consciousness, there’s just going to be a new Ariel as well."

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"As an aside from this whole thing, a lot of cross racial casting has been redheads! MJ in the MCU also comes to mind."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"I think you’ve hit on an issue there that’s important. This kind of casting can come across as performative diversity, especially when Disney seemingly isn’t dedicating themselves to bringing black-written fairytales or black original characters on screen. 

That said, in this particular instance I think it’s a balancing out of a pantheon of characters that were historically white, in the story where it makes the most sense. 

If this is still happening in 20-30 years and original black stories still aren’t being told, then I think this argument would hold more weight. 

(I also wish they’d cast black actors for Eric and Ursula too, but there we are! Jordan Fisher and Laverne Cox were *robbed* in my opinion.)"
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,">>a lot of people hate the woke movement because it makes for awful films

Do you think that realistically, they’d put more effort into the movie with a white actor? Because the live action remakes with white actors are just as lazy. The real issue seems to be that remakes tend to be lazy and rely on source material as a crutch. 

And when people do make the original black characters, there’s still an extreme level of hate and criticism."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"Congratulations, you never understood the *point* of The Little Mermaid.

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"Hopefully the more these people expose themselves as lacking discernment, the less of an effect the review bombing will have on the movie’s financial prospects. Fingers crossed! 

That said, the hate this poor girl will receive will be inconceivable. I hope she’s ok and has a good team around her and support for her mental health. That’s the one part of the cross racial casting I struggle with; it feels like Disney is offering up these young performers on an altar to get hate from the racists while potentially reaping rewards themselves for demonstrating diverse casting. The same thing is happening to the sweet girl playing Annabeth in the PJO series. Really hope Disney puts their money where their mouth is and is investing their resources into providing ongoing support for their performers."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"You do realise they don’t recall the original movie when they do an adaptation, right?

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"People can relate to characters for all sorts of reasons.

If you get maligned for your looks - and minorities tend to get this the worst and with traumatic context - then a character that looks like you might be a huge deal."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"Yes I do, and I’ve said in several replies that I understand why this casting feels performative. 

However, there is also a pantheon of characters that have been fed to generations of young girls as inspiration, and that pantheon certainly until the ‘00s was predominantly white. So, to my mind, this is a balancing, in the story where it makes the most sense to affect the change. The value of seeing a character you already love and identify with looking like you may also be very powerful in the context of feeling underrepresented. 

We also have to acknowlege that we’re living in a culture that prioritises remakes and adaptations - these are the films that make money and what the studios want to do. The movies were adapting from (and I’m referring to more than just Disney here) are generally not diverse. If we keep that same casting for the sake of posterity we’re continuing deny POC representation and jobs, which is not the way to go. 

Anyway, as I said if you really can’t get over it you don’t have to watch it, but review bombing etc. is disrespectful and unnecessary."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"The CGI and tail rendering looks a lot better than what I was expecting. Although the colours used look slightly dull, and I loved the vibrancy of the original. Hopefully we’re just looking at a dark scene and they’ll still have the bright colours in other parts! I also wish they’d let her do more Broadway/belt vocals because it sounds like they’ve encouraged her to do a more modern/pop sound with the vocal runs and riffs and that doesn’t suit the music in my opinion. Beyoncé does the same in The Lion King and Ariana Grande did it in Hairspray Live and it just irritates me. One riff is ok, on every other note the music as written gets lost. 

I hold out hope! Lin Manuel Miranda has never put a foot wrong before! 

The amount of people telling me that I’m letting little girls who look like me get left behind is absurd. There’s a cognitive dissonance there between admitting how important representation is and not seeing what a huge step this is in favour of that. 

And lucky you on your redhead wife! As a fellow Ariel lover I hope the movie meets her expectations :))"
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"I have no idea what you mean by this, could you clarify?

If you mean there are currently little white redhead girls out there who don’t have this character anymore; the original still exists, and there’s now Merida, and famously Anna from Frozen. Disenchanted is also coming up which stars Amy Adams, a gorgeous redhead. The girls will be ok, I promise!"
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"I’m English, which might make the difference. 

Have heard redheads get better treatment in the US (and thus possibly elsewhere, but not sure.) Jessica Chastain does a funny bit on the Graham Norton Show about how horrified she was when she came to the UK about how we treat “gingers.”"
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"This is a comment about my personal experience with this character; as someone with freckly pale skin, pale eyes and vivid red hair (not to mention half Irish being raised in England in the context of the Troubles and GFA), who was actively bullied for their looks, this character was meaningful to me in the pantheon of Disney princesses released at the time as one that looked like me. 

Kids going through my experience now have Merida, Anna, even Gisele. I did not; Ariel was it for me. 

So, I had a split second of disappointment when Halle Bailey was cast (especially because she reposted a fan image of her iteration with dark hair) that it wouldn’t look like me. Even if she had ketchup red hair added in post production that wouldn’t change for me, personally. But as I say I have made my peace with that, recognising that the greater good and need lies with black children and adults who have *never* seen themselves represented like this."

I bet conservatives would be remarkably happy with the change to a black actor if Disney followed the original story more closely."

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"There’s a big difference though. The point of Black Panther as a story is intrinsically tied to skin colour, unlike this example. The idea behind Wakanda is a world where Africa was free to thrive untouched by European colonialism. The only reason Wakanda exists is because of its strict isolationism. Having white Wakandans would violate the story both logically and thematically - which are the two parts of the story.

In comparison, the Little Mermaid is intentionally anachronistic. It’s loosely based on a Danish story, and the human world reflects this, but the underwater world is Greco-Roman, the villain is based on a famous drag queen and a Caribbean crab sings calypso songs. 

In general it’s harder to swap these situations around (from being about the majority to minority) because minority roles and media are much more likely to have that minority experience in its heart. Most mainstream American and British films with black/Asian leads have specific racial or cultural plots or themes that wouldn’t easily translate if they cast a different race. In media set in the past, non-white supporting roles will likely have some plot or thematic connection to race, because non-white people back then were treated differently to the majority. So some of these roles could be depicted by white actors, but most of the prominent examples can’t. 

When creators depict homogenous societies as diverse in media which doesn’t rely on racial themes/storylines, they’re forgoing accuracy to better represent the modern society they’re making the art for. This can be for emotional reasons or because they don’t want to exclude non-white actors from the vast majority of period roles. This is very different from most films with predominantly non-white casts in practical terms, not even thinking about the differences due to historical context."

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"Well I guess this comment was making the argument that if a species with human like anatomy (at least for part of their body) lived deep underwater where there was little sunlight, then evolutionary-wise there wouldn’t be any need for the species to have the melanin rich dark skin that black ppl have. Since human evolved black skin because they lived in areas with intense sunlight and having dark skin helps protect them from all the UV light they’re exposed to and natural selection favoured ppl with dark skin in those regions. I suppose the evolutionary pressure associated with living underwater would be similar to humans migrating further North where there’s less sunlight and then experiencing selection for pale skin (I think there’s also the fact that pale skin generate more vit D). 

But anyways that’s just if you rly wanna be more scientific about what the skin colour for a hypothetical fish-human species would be."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"Hmm. Maybe as a species though shouldn't they all look the same? Because at the end of the day they're not human. If they're all born in the deep they should all look like pale abominations. My favorite mermaids are from the movie Underwater.

Just as well you can look at seahorses for an example of vertical orientation that works in that environment. Humans main claim to fame is being inexhaustible but also being so social tool use became the norm along with capacity for higher reason.

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"I hope the backlash doesn’t drive her away from acting, she really does have a nice voice"
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,Definitely a great voice.
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"I read that after Halle Bailey auditioned, they didn’t want to see anyone else. So she clearly wowed them. I had/have more of a problem with Emma Watson being Belle when she just couldn’t sing. 

I’m a white woman over 30 and let me tell you, I was teary eyed when I heard the original score in the trailer. When Halle started singing, I was fully  ugly crying. I can’t imagine how wonderful those little girls felt seeing Ariel look like them. I’m hopeful that this remake will be really good as a whole and I can’t wait to see more of Halle."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"That’s my issue. She can hit notes, but her tone is not right for this musical.

That said getting mad over the race of any fictional character is an emotional reaction. As two white guys we have much less justification to be emotional about this particular subject. I will say this though, I im8gine many non white people would prefer original characters as well"

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"And Shakespeare was an English writer, but cultures worldwide have adapted his works. Are you going to bitch if some school in NY wants to do a play and uses a diverse cast? How many black girls do you think were named Ariel because of the movie. My niece is one such girl (now a woman, and she does have natural red hair). 
Not so long ago, the Mormon church started to open membership to blacks. Now the church is all over Africa, the Caribbean, and Latin America looking for members. Why is this? Yes, some beliefs may have changed, but they also had to face reality. They needed to expand and spread their gospel beyond their limited base. Likewise, Hollywood is in this to make money first. This is why Pixar, Disney, and other studios have been making movies like Mulan, Kung Fu Panda, and Coco. No one is going to forget the original little mermaid if Hollywood decides to make the fictional character Chinese, Indian, or Hispanic. And why didn’t people complain about the stereotypical West Indian crab in the movie that sang calypso. Is calypso Danish? Hollywood has always taken stories and changed them, it isn’t known for its originality. From the retelling of the Japanese Seven Samurai, to an African Dracula in Blacula, to a European  cyborg in the live action Ghost in a Shell, Hollywood is known for lifting from other cultures. There are so many movies that borrow from black cultures, though the characters may be talking animals, or a mostly white human cast. Europeans have been talking stories from other cultures for centuries and adapting and changing them. A few weeks ago, I saw an exhibition that was centered around Whistler’s painting of a woman in a white dress. I remembered the impact of Japanese art on him, and those influences were evident in some of his works. And what about Picasso’s debt to African art? I could go on about the borrowing and appropriation of art, music, stories, and believe systems (Mythologies) from other cultures, but any learned person should know this. Finally, the multi cultural space in which we live is a result of your European ancestors encroaching and remaking the world to suit their needs and wants. Cultures borrow from each other (even though Hollywood’s ultimate goal is about making money and expanding their brands), so if you don’t have a problem with Elvis, or a blonde Jesus, you shouldn’t have a problem with a fictional black mermaid, or werewolf."

They didn't know how insulting this would end up being though. A lot of black people are offended (not about this movie specifically, but about diversity casting in general) because these companies would change something that already has a cultural identity (Danish) instead of doing something that actually aligns with their culture (like princess and the frog)

Everything must be exactly the same? This is another version. I love beauty and the beast, I don’t need the new version to be  the same because it’s a new interpretation. Their cartoon version had a white girl with red hair. This new version is a black girl with red hair. She was picked because she was the best audition. Why is this so hard to understand? 
Why are you not open and adaptable to seeing a new version of a story? 

Brandy was Cinderella in *one* version of Cinderella and that one of my favorite alternative Cinderellas because they took the story and added some sass that wasn’t in the OG, it’s just a fun movie.

>Being invisible, on the other hand, may be a better strategy for escaping predators and moving through the water undetected by prey. In a new study published last week in Current Biology, researchers have discovered an evolutionary tactic that gives some fishes an invisibility cloak. For the first time, an ultra-black skin color or pigmentation that protects 16 varieties of deep-sea fishes has been documented and studying the efficient survival tactic could provide insight into developing new synthetic camouflage materials as well as have implications for the understanding and treatment of skin cancers.

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"She has not been replaced. The original Danish tale still exists. The Disney version has always been innacurate as fuck anyway and the old animated adaptation, it's sequel and all the other Content about it does not cease to exist because this adaption has a black actress. The black Cinderella in the 90s didn't replace the white one that came before her. It was just a different adaptation. 

Y'all need to chill. Like yes, original stories about black characters would be amazing. But let people find the joy in what wins they do get because capitalism ain't gonna let many 150 million dollar original films get made and this that do will be as financially safe as possible."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,If you think they are making all these live action movies for any other reason than to renew the trademarks then you are lying to yourself.

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"Singing is just a part of the consideration. In my opinion, story should be the main consideration. Disney have made it about race not me, main characters who are black is trendy now (eg. Bridgeton).

Like I said, if they made Ariel black, the rest of the family better be black too. If not, it’s just bs because the story has taken a backseat."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"I just said that Disney is doing it for virtue signaling and money, not for fighting racism. I literally don’t give a fuck about her race, I have no doubt she’s an amazing actress that deserves the role.
But if you think that Disney is really for “race is not important to us”, try to ask them to do Mulan with a white girl instead. See how that goes and how is received, even if like you said (and I agree) there’s no point in be obsessed in race."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"Sure, and those were original stories based off of the classic characters.

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"With how effective Disney has been at extending copyright laws, the movies they are remaking - even one as old as Pinocchio - still have decades to go before they need to worry about their IP. It's just a cash grab."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"They made that movie too adult. They figured the kids who grew up watching lion king would want to see a mature version of lion king “what if we have real life photo realistic lions…only lion king” when in reality what we wanted was lion king. I would take that YouTube big eyes emotional faces version anytime.

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"This is not entirely related to what you said, but Mulan. I was in Disneyworld’s Animal Kingdom looking at anklets. This cast member came over and started up some Disney convo with me. Asked me my favorite Disney princess (I’m an adult there with my own kid). I said Mulan, and then she replies “Did you know that Mulan has the highest verifiable kill count in any Disney movie?!” She started spitting Murder Mulan facts at me with a swiftness that not even an air bender could dodge. Considering their persistently positive attitudes, I thought this (morbid) exchange was hysterical. Years later, she is still by far my favorite cast member of all time and I think about her sometimes.

I’m done with my mostly unrelated tangent, just thought I’d share."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"they’re not. scuttle, sebastian, and flounder are all cast. composer alan menken from the original movie has returned, lin manuel miranda joined (original lyricist howard ashman passed in 1991), and they wrote 4 new songs in addition to including the songs from the original.

halle bailey wasn’t cast for brownie points like i keep seeing said either. [go on youtube and listen to her sing](https://youtu.be/T4MajGTp1x8), or watch interviews and see what her personality is like. even if everything else about the movie turns out horribly, she 100% has the spirit of the character and a stellar voice."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"I mean the whole story is about Ariel singing and then trading her voice for life as a human on the surface, so it would be kinda hard removing the songs from it."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"They’re probably going to remove or heavily demote the singing animals because for some reason it really gets the Chinese censors excited when animals are elevated to the same level as human characters. 

More importantly, the entire driving force of the plot is Ariel wanting to break out of an oppressive society and experience life in a free world that’s been denied her. Disney wants the Chinese market too bad to piss off the CCP that much, so they’re going to eviscerate  that whole theme out of the movie. Disney might show two second clip of men holding hands that they can easily censor out from China, while still having a talking point to claim they did something brave and controversial. But they won’t include an entire theme that is completely antithetical to Chinese communism, that’s exactly why Mulan sucked so bad."

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,The original comment was about why there was so many dislikes.

Then again, I also wish Disney hadn't divested themselves of 2D animation entirely also, but Disney seems to prefer 'safer' cash grabs.

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,I love the unique idea movies. The problem is you can’t even criticize them when you bait them with social politics when they have problems. I got yelled at so much for saying Encantos plot kind of sucked because “this is alll about my culture and you just don’t understand”. Same with Black Panther.  I think it was very mediocre but apparently saying anything less than it is the best marvel movie is sin worthy. It feels like you can’t just enjoy a movie without people getting defensive with identity politics.

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"The thing you think is political ideology is what is called ""pandering for money"". Disney's decisions are 100% based on where the most cash can be collected for the lowest cost."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"I think they should make more movies like Miracle and Secretariat - movies about interesting historical events that are also family friendly.

Lot of people looking for a reason to feel good about their country lately."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"A lot of their classic movies are retreads of existing tales.

Man, what really gets me is how damned classic the cartoons and songs are ... and just how forgettable the live action movies are.

There is NO cultural impact from any of the live action movies.

The only reason we watch these live action movies are to sing along with the classic songs we know but we'll forget them and Disney's probably going to try to remake them again."

I don’t remember the exact reason for the dullness in color from what viewers remember as particularly vibrant and overall gorgeous bright scenes from the animated versions, but I’m sure it’s something to do with saving money, I’m sure we can’t expect a conglomerate like Disney to invest and put money in their productions in the right places though."

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"I think that’s all it is honestly. Saving money on production costs… if it looks like crap though, why would anyone watch it? They’ve already shot them selves in the foot by proving that something can look great, but still not be watchable, so maybe they might catch on someday to pay attention not just to how something looks, but the quality of the script - like maybe not repeating line for line the words from the originals minus any of the clever parts, the acting (don’t have your actors tone of voice sound as if they’d rather be dead than in your movie), the songs- if you’re going to do a repeat or an original, you’re really going to have to have an amazing musical team on that, and I don’t mean Beyoncé. 

Yes, she has a great voice, no one’s disputing that, but her score in the lion king fell very flat in my opinion, nothing memorable about it, nothing about that film felt like anyone even wanted to *be* there. 
Well I’ll give them props for one thing- it was unique in how bizarre and heartless the entire thing was. 

Maybe it’s a subtle nod to how depressing the times we live in are. After all, we’re supposed to be so technologically advanced and have such easy lives now- ha ha. Honestly, I saw more than adequate technology come out of the 90’s and it seemed like a pretty good stopping point in terms of how much public access we needed for a better life balance between technology and real-life. But of course humanity never learns, and things never stop progressing… I just don’t see much of anything progressing in the right direction. Not the things that really matter, not to me anyway."

In this scene Ariel is in her grotto reaching towards the beam of sun filling the space, grasps nothing, and falls back down to the bottom towards the sand. 

It represents how the mermaid world doesn't suit her, she longs for the human word and to walk in the sun, but she can't get there, it's out of her reach, and she's hurting. It's her 'I want' song. It's an emotional pinnacle of the film.

Her sitting on a dark rock to sing this is *terrible* film making and it's flagging that we're going to get another shit house lion king-esque remake."

And so, with the creation of ~~Heinrich Himmler~~ Ariel as first mermaid in visual design, it defined the basics of what we think of it now today.

I watched it and honestly it was just bad. Like just really bad. And the critical reviews for were it were all pretty positive, especially when it first released. And I suspect a lot of that was they were afraid of being accused of sexism because of the shitshow was playing out on the internet.

I dont think that went unnoticed by the movie studios. 

Fast forward to today and there are so many movies with some little controversial nugget in them, and each has the same narrative: this movie is only getting panned because neckbeards are upset about <thing>.

Just in the past couple months: Lightyear with the same sex kiss: a boring movie nobody wanted is only getting bad reviews from fans because they are homophobic. Rings of Power: bad writing (why do rocks sink but not boats? wtf was this speech?!) and getting a lot of stuff totally wrong lorewise. Bad reviews are all review bombs from racists upset about our black elf tho.

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"This is roughly the argument I've been forwarding.

Ariel is ""really"" white? Well, no, she's really *fictional*. Mythological, in fact. There IS no color she ""is"".

The story is Danish? Well ok, it was written by a Dane, but unless there are actually mermaids in Denmark, Ariel isn't Danish, she's *a mermaid*.

Is *pink* the right color for a mermaid's skin? Seems to me like a mermaid ""really"" ought to be green. Or maybe silvery like a dolphin. What if Disney whitewashed her last time? 

If after all this it still really matters to somebody that this particular fictional non-human mythical creature is ""really"" white, then that's their own hangup, almost certainly based in a social attitude that they'll probably lose your mind if I name right out loud.

The lore that everybody is worried about concerns the skin colour of fantasy characters.  

Everything else is largely cover.  Plausible deniability is the racist's best friend."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"Yeah, nobody is worried about the people criticizing the show for, say, some trivial plot detail. They are worried at the people criticizing it for having a character with black skin. *Those* are the people the guy you responded to was talking about. Not sure why you'd think otherwise."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"They ignored a bunch of lore and compressed timelines which is understandable criticism of the storytelling and writing choices. Having a few black guys on screen isn’t a valid criticism. The color of a characters skin has never been relevant to tolkiens work beyond providing a description of them. 

Same with a black mermaid. It’s just a fairy tale about a fictional being. The story and music is what’s important when judging as a form of media, not the casting choices."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"There are degrees of racism.

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"> People can dislike a show without being racist.

But see Amazon has pushed the idea that anyone who doesn't like it only dislikes it because they are secretly racist. And now even posting this comment has made others think ""this guy must be secretly racist"". The fact is there is another fantasy show on *right* now with a very similar fanbase to LotR and also cast several roles with black actors and it isn't getting ""review bombed by racists"", and I'm talking about House of the Dragon. Why are we not reading all these stories about that show as well? I'll tell you why. Because it's actually good. And yes there are idiot racists online who made disparaging comments about that show casting black actors but guess what that number of people wasn't enough to cause a ""review bomb"". And don't tell me ""well LotR is bigger than GoT"" because HotD is getting double the viewership that Ring of Power is. I'll get downvoted for just pointing out the truth of this matter. Maybe this shit ain't actually getting review bombed and maybe people are just hating on shitty shows. And maybe just maybe corporations are trying to push the racism narrative because they know it will drum up some line of support for their shitty product regardless of it's quality. Hell it's worked before."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"Perhaps it would be good to consider that the common element in reviews of ROP is it's boring and the dialog is simply dreadful. Some slow burns fizzle out..

Because 

1 - you're not paying attention and/or are terrible at recognizing racism

and 

2 - the bigots have simply been less successful on that front.  Harder to use plausible deniability of 'we just care about lore accuracy' when GRRM is an executive producer on the show.  They've definitely been trying, though."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"> That show took an all white fantasy cast and put black actors into some of its most prominent roles.

It was previously established that the people from the Summer Isles are black, and some Valyrian lines being black doesn't contradict anything established, either. A stretch? Possibly, but meh fucking meh."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"LOL. Representation matters is a thing because there are a limited number of non-white superheroes/protagonists, heroes/leads portrayed in American media. White children are not starving for characters who look like them in popular culture, what are you even talking about?"
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"That doesn't answer my question. The casting call should be definite with ""White Caucasian women"" plus the age, and other defining characteristics. Hair color can be dyed so no problems there.

Indiana Jones just wants to fuck over the Nazis. Blade just wants to kill vampires. Nothing to do with their race. No flashbacks to Germany or Nigeria. Asians don't generally get that treatment, and writers feel the need to drop all sorts of ""This is what life is like as an Asian"" treats in there for everyone."

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,Some downvote out of  reaction because of what was said about other movies like Ghost in the Shell or others like it in the past.
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"Idk maybe it’s cause I had a lot of theater kid friends we saw people of all races doing roles of classically white characters so it doesn’t seem like a big deal for me?? A movie I liked a lot when I was younger was the Cinderella movie with the black actress. Idk, it never made me upset?"
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,Well if we wanna go genetic do you know why their is not a lot of black swimmers concave and convex has something to do with it. Either the blood or body. Hence many black runners. Seriously I don't mind a black Ariel if she can sing and the movie isn't cliché woke then I am all for it. But look up stats about lack of black professional swimmers. That saying it's fantasy so anything is possible. It might make it real and at the end when she gets her legs from falling in love with her master (which the cartoon depicted him as a slave trader to a white ariel) she might go oh shiiit jump in the water to be a mermaid her convex blood screws her up and she drowns.
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"Ffs this is the remake of the original animation not the original fairy tale. In the classic she is white and has red hair. Thats it. If an Asian or Hispanic or Indian gets casted, I still have the same issue. The argument is if Disney wants a remake of a classic, they should try to stick to the original context as much as possible, especially when she is the main character. Disliking the director casting Halle for the role doesnt mean we hate black people.
On another hand, Halle voice is magnificent and I hate that she gets involved in this stupid situation."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,Correct. But Ariel DID have a race. So did all 6 of her sisters. Two of which were of Asian descent.
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"K, I want Ryan Reynolds’s to play Blade. I don’t want to hear any complaining.

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"So, would you have the same thoughts if they put a white person in the role of a well known Black character? Like, a white man playing Black Panther?"

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,I’ve heard the actress sing and heard her talk about the angle she took with the role and I genuinely think they picked her because she was the best one for the part.

Additionally, fish in the deep ocean are black because there is very little light where they live. Last I checked, Ariel isn’t a deep sea mermaid."

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"You can still dislike the video without the extension, it just doesn't show you the dislike count, which can be a bad thing because it's a lot harder to tell if something is actually worth your time or not, like with tutorial videos, if the video is full of inaccurate and useless info, you won't know that until after you've either wasted your time watching the video or after following the instructions in the video if you don't know that it contains bad info, which in one of the worst case scenarios, could result in serious injury or even the death of the person."

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,It only knows the dislikes from people who have the add-on and guesses what the real dislike would be based on that. Problem is the people that have that add-on are not really a good distribution of the population. It most likely heavily male in a certain age range.
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"Because every last device that could see the dislike ratio has been updated to not show it, how else would you be able to see it or even make an educated guess?"

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"The number of people who have this extension is laughably small and should not be taken into account at all, the videos that we have data as to how disliked they were is irrelevant to a brand new trailer"

Bigger source like League of Legend spotlight channel has mentioned the similar thing in the past with their video having only like 100 dislikes but the extension showing like 500 dislikes"
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"It's not accurate because the people who actually care about showing the dislikes are those that'll dislike more.

Someone who tends to not care (the majority of people now) won't install that."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"How about it is not accurate because it doesnt actually measure only the people likely to want to see the film to begin with. Like everything else you got a vocal minority of people in the world that are gonna be hating because it is a black girl instead of a white girl. But lets face it, these proud boy wanna bees in their dark basements who are jacking off to cartoon porn of the white girl topless with a fish body because they think titties and bass fishing are both manly things to like, are not going to see the movie anyway.

And when it is finally released it will likely be a number 1 for that week at the box office, and will likely make 1.3 billion dollars for disney off of disney fans and little girls and their families going to the movies."

its hilariously biased and im guessing that crowd skews conservative/racist, too."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"The estimate isn't just the number of people with the extension who dislike the video. They take the ratio of views to dislikes for the extension users and extrapolate it out to all viewers.

So no, if anything the real amount of dislikes is much lower."

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"The version I remember from when I was a kid said the mermaid’s sisters traded their hair to the sea witch in exchange for a magic dagger. The mermaid was supposed to stab the prince in the heart with it in order to return to the sea. When she crept into the couple’s bedroom after the wedding, she saw how happy they were and couldn’t go through with it. She was going to kill herself with the dagger instead, but some sea nymphs convinced her to join them by turning into foam. At least that is what I can remember. Now I’ll have to look for that book lol."

I don’t have a problem with acknowledging things that were wrong, but I don’t really think that race-swapping original Disney princesses is necessary to that, make a new one!

Now that we are in a society that (hopefully) sees everyone as equal… why not start making up for the past and cast people of color?
  
Casting someone white for a historically colored character completely goes against the whole concept of white-washed Hollywood."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"So you're saying you do have a problem with her skin color if you call it race swapping. Name another black female Disney heroine, there's Tiana and... oh wait that's just about fucking it. The original still exists with a white character and everything.

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"Or, they used the vocalist that has been singing professionally Ariel's part for Disney for literally years and she happens to be black.

Occam's Razor and all that, instead of the insane, borderline racist conspiracy theory you're pushing."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"If a character is *written* a particular race, then it's racist to put in a white character for their spot.

I'm not saying that backlash is logical, but you're not using logic either. The old-time non-white characters are usually written such that it's integral to the character. That's why the studios let them be cast (or look dark) at all. Swapping that would unwrite the character. 

It would be just as awful to do that with distinctly white characters. I can't imagine someone trying to do Gone With the Wind and messing up Scarlett. She's white. Period. 

We depart from descriptions all the time, that won't change. But blondeness was never integral to Ariel's identity, nor was having red hair, nor pale skin. I feel like rolling my eyes that people can't cope with that since it's been going on as long as there's been fiction."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"So... if they can't race swap known characters, who can they race swap? Nobody. The status quo in Hollywood has always been white characters. If they're going to remake movies, why not update it to today by making it a bit more diverse instead of ""everyone is white""? 

People used to race swap in the other direction all the time. John Wayne as Genghis Khan? Mickey Rooney in Breakfast at Tiffany's? Yeah. That's why people are sensitive about it.

So calm your tits. It's a black mermaid instead of a white one for a change. Get over it."

Black Panther is literally defined by his race and culture, which is race specific for historical reasons (it's even in the name).

So tell me who is erasing or ignoring cultural history here?"
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"Yeah, but those populations don't live underwater where they have minimal sunlight. They leave on the islands where it is glaring sunlight all the time. Since mermaids are so different from humans in terms of biology and can swim anywhere it is very likely that they wouldn't be evolved directly from the locals. And to further back that idea up, mermaids have appeared in many different cultures across the world from the Syrians to the Norse, so a specific genetic background seems hard to back up with real world connections.

Also not sure where you got the idea that mermaid's in the Disney universe needed coral.

Look, I don't have anything against the casting. I'm not going to watch the movie anyways and given Disney normally making terrible live action remakes I'm sure that the race of the actors will be the least of our concerns.

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"Edit: lmao and you guys wonder why we get fed drivel and lazy reboots at the box office.

There are a few factors at play here. Personally Amazon is a billion dollar company, they dropped a billion on this show specifically with the intention of being it the most watched show of the year, so not gonna lie, I feel like people deserve to be picky on whether or not it's good. I don't get why people are up in arms to defend this show by this company, it's like they have a personal stake in the show doing well, so much so that they're going to ignore errors that they might think are trivial. This company dropped a billion on this show, they could've spent some of that on actually trying to fit the established lore. They aren't, and are actively trying to subvert specific pieces of the lore in an attempt to make this story their own. Essentially, this company bought the name so they could use it to field their own fantasy story without having to do any of the world building themselves and are only taking the parts they liked. Really, anyone defending the show for being fun should probably try and understand that they're paying a billion dollar company to do this with zero repercussions. Frankly, that should set off alarms from the get go.

Now for the meat; everyone is up in arms over the black elf, and everyone is defending the decision. Problem is, Tolkien specifically created the story because the ancient cultures of Britain were mostly erased by Catholicism and the Roman empire, leaving a huge amount of history gone never to be seen or read from again. Imagine your culture losing their entire heritage. Now imagine trying to create a myth to fill that gap, so that in the future hundreds of years from now they are telling Tolkien's stories the same way we tell stories of Huckleberry Fynn and Tom Sawyer, or Perseus and Odysseus, or stories of ancient Chinese martial artists. Now imagine taking a work that was viewed with that significance and commercializing it, selling it to the highest bidder, and seeing millions of people ignore the cultural significance because it's fun. That story doesn't belong to us, in the same way a story about the Pharos doesn't belong to us, or a story from the Inuit. It should be treated like they treated Moana, with a thorough understanding of the heart of the work and representing as accurate a portrayal as possible. Hell, even the movies made some huge errors and simply spawned an era of cash grab movie tie ins that worked to further dismantle the lore. The black elf by himself, not a problem. The black elf on top of their portrayal of Galadriel, racist Irish stereotypes in the hobbits, a focus on character drama as opposed to myth building, I know this is a meme but the beardless dwarf, these errors stack up and build a clear picture. That clear picture is that Amazon couldn't give less of a fuck about what Middle Earth was all about and is only trying to cash in. They spent a billion dollars, they could afford to have done a little bit more research. I'm not gonna give them my money for this, and it's a shame so many are willing to."

As someone who grew up in the 80s and 90s with all these animated originals, I haven't actually enjoyed any of the live action remakes. But they're not for me! Sure, it would be ideal if they were enjoyed by all ages but at the end of the day, if the kids like 'em, who cares!

We had the original as kids. They still exist. What different does it make if there's an updated version for a new generation, even if it is a worse film? We didn't pay for it..."

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"Because representation aims for the « base » of a country. Asians in america still have asian culture, the immigrated to america. Mexicans in america still have mexican culture, they immigrated, etc. (Point being these are groups of people who chose to immigrate to a country with a different racial profile and culture). Its like if you moved to korea, you wouldnt expect korean films to force white people into movies to cater to you.
For african americans its different, they wherent voluntary immigrants, they are part of the « original » racial profile of the country, but weren’t represented as such in the past.

This is imo why this trend is good from an American pov, but as a european its strange."

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"Nope. I’m gonna assume you’re being serious and not trying to be snarky with your comment. 

How often do you have an Asian playing a masculine leading man? Romantic heartthrob that isn’t a scraggly underdog? Suave action star that isn’t a foreign kung fu master? Super hero… that isn’t a foreign kung fu master? An assassin who also isn’t a foreign kung fu master?

Not to mention most “Asian” roles are played by Chinese actors. I guess people must still think that Asian = Chinese in Hollywood. And that is also means foreign kung fu master.

Let’s not pretend that Asians are well represented in media. They’re typecasted into oblivion with only damaging, stereotype reinforcing roles available to them."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"That’s true! I also hate this “if they made a black character white it would cause outrage!” schtick. Deeply disingenuous argument.

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"I don’t know if this was always the *intention* behind the story (especially as the original is a) extremely old, and b) explicitly says those love stories must end in tragedy.) I think the point of the original movie is that love can transcend any barriers, but not sure in the 80s children cartoon they were thinking explicitly of race. 

But it is certainly the best interpretation of the themes, the most prescient way of applying those themes to our age, and applying a visible racial dynamic to the cross-species love story makes that very explicit and clear, which is nice. Still would have liked black Eric, though, to be honest. I don’t know if it’s my own biases from what I watch but I feel like there’s increased representation of black women but black men don’t get into the hero/Prince role in these sorts of movies very often, which feels…loaded."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"I’ve just seen that! Gross.

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"Annie and Wonka aren’t Disney princesses, Merida and Anna are. So, kids do have the experience that  I had. And now more kids will have it due to black Ariel. 

I think Disney should be writing original stories for black characters. But casting one character as black in a pantheon of white characters - in a movie where the entire soundtrack is inspired by Caribbean influences - isn’t worthy of review bombing or harassing the actress involved."

Like Ariel is not a symbol for white people, in case you *haven't* actually given it any thought.

White people have no end of representation, so white characters are not designed to be representative of their race or culture. Minorities do not have that same scale of representation, so cultural authenticity features more heavily in their background, values, and general character.

Its also not really cultural appropriation because of context. Europe subjugated and stamped out many cultures around the world, cherry picking things they liked to take home and integrate into their own culture as well as forcing their own culture onto those subjugated. For this reason, European culture is not unnatural or approriated for those colonized."

I’m sure you’ve asked this question or read it 100x and gotten the answer to why it is such a shitty comparison 100x and you still post it. This is a shitty comparison and you can just be honest and say you don’t want a black actress instead of acting like you have a good or logical argument."

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,How is Ariel's whiteness an integral part of her character compared to Black Panther's blackness?  One is the ruler of a technologically advanced African civilization the other is a mermaid teenager.  Ariel being white isn't material to her character.
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"That’s a bad example because black panther is based on a fictional group that so happen to be all black.

Now, unless theres a plotline that explains how a white girl/guy came to wukanda, etc, then that would make sense.

But the fact that you have to change/create a whole story to fit in a white character into a native Wakanda character… just shows that it would never work, or be an overall bad story (could be good if done right potentially)

You can’t say the same for my little mermaid tho. The color of the mermaid plays no significant role in the movie. The mermaid could be Asian, middle eastern, Mexican, and the story would still be the same"
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"Point out where it says anywhere the race of the little mermaid. She was not a ""white character"" she was a character thats originally source material was vague and non specific in race and animation studio _chose_ to make her white. Its a mermaid. It could be fucking purple"
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"Its not the same. It doesnt even tip the scale  when a black character replaces a white one, but because there are so few black idols on screen, a white person taking the role from one would be much more unbalanced because the majority of idols on screen are white men.

Considering that white straight men have the majority of screen time, when you take issue with a race swap or a female lead or a gay character.

You are racist, sexist and homophobic. Simple as."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"Do you have any ideas how many movies swap out black, asian, native, black, etc for white actors? How many movies and shows are white washed? Yet you never make as sound about that, do you? Even good ol Jesus is white washed. You only bitch when it's women and/or black people. It's pathetic."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"That’s a false equivalency.

 Being black is a part of black panthers character, lore, background, nationality.

Being white is in no way part of Ariel’s character. She is the exact same character if she’s black, white, or Asian. It doesn’t matter."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,In the context of a Back majority society with an undeserved White population it would be fucking fantastic.

After reaching that satisfied feeling they stop watching and do something else.  If YouTube serves you shitty videos, you tend to watch MORE, because you are looking for a satisfying feeling.  By hiding the negative votes, you are more likely to waste more of your time watching shitting videos and therefor spending more time watching YouTube. It's not political.

Allowing people to ""vote"" on wether or not their opinion of a video is positive or negative IS democracy even if a majority of people voting on that specific video is racist.

 See, people you disagree for (arguably very valid) reasons being allowed the same vote as you is democracy and taking the choice to vote away from everyone is not closer to democracy in any way."

If you doubt any word that I say, read The Ebony Hors, and similar stories from أَلْفُ لَيْلَةٍ وَلَيْلَةٌ, ʾAlf Laylah wa-Laylah, or as it is better known in the west as One Thousand and One Nights. Just read those stories, and then tell me with a straight face, from the djinns perspective, this is not how he would view humans? because the original arab folk tales are wild. UI mean, I am german, we have the brothers grimm, we have some seriously dark shit in our folk tales of tolerable infant terror, but we have JACK SHIT when it comes to the traditional arab folk tales. 

Many of the accounts deserve a NSFL tag, and should only be consumed when drunk, and there are no children nearby. The original 1001 nigts is like 50 shades of grey, mixed with the silence of the lambs, on crack. ."

Disney was making this movie anyway. That cart came before the horse. In doing so they made a decision to correct some of the companies past biases( which really have nothing to do with the story here, that's just the backdrop). It's not really about making mermaid movies. That idea can also happen, doesn't mean this one shouldn't too. This is addressing something specific with Disney, specifically.

Horseshit.  It not being 100% lore accurate in every way is only being used as cover for the anti-woke sentiment being pushed.  Nothing is ever 100% lore accurate.

This is basically a variation of the quote

I don't give a shit about whatever they'll hamfistedly do with *this* version of Ariel. They're claiming that this is a live-action remake of one of their most beloved films. The whole thing rides on her naivete and innocence. There's no way that any aspect of this remake will work without it. And no one will buy naivete from a voice that grown-up. -- And I'm still paraphrasing Howard Ashman here."

Correct, that is why Black Panther was created and should remain the body of work as it is today. There should never be a Latino, Asian, etc version of Black Panther. Doing so is merely hijacking an established character and story. Which is the basis of my entire argument.

Just because there isn’t some “higher message” behind a character, that doesn’t excuse the changing of that character to meet some narrative. 

Speedy Gonzalez is an established character of Latino origin. He should NEVER be changed to be another race or suddenly make him a 2nd Amendment sympathizer. That’s not who or what that character ever was.

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"Correct.

If the video has 100m total views, 5m from people with the extension and 50k people with the extension disliked the video, it'll show 1m dislikes."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"They disabled them in the API shortly after they stopped showing them, the extension makes an educated guess based on trends and dislikes from people who use the extension."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"LinusTechTips talked in a livestream about this, the extension is not accurate at all and showed what the extension thought were the dislikes and what the real dislikes were, it’s just making a guess with nothing to base it on"
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"API access was removed a few weeks after dislikes were. From this point forward, the return dislikes extension is approximate. It uses plenty of data that it does have access to to give a reasonable value. If the extension says it has millions of dislikes, that video is very likely to have millions of dislikes."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"""YouTube is removing the ability to access dislike counts through its API starting December 13""  
  
And here is what the extension maker said:  
  
""This extension aims to restore power to users by using a combination of archived like and dislike data, as well as the likes and dislikes made by extension users to show the most accurate ratings."""
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,What kind of ‘data’ do they have? I have glimpsed over the source code and can say it is just a random algorithm that does not really represent a dislike. Please prove me wrong if you have the info.
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"Only true if the self-selected sample of people who use the extension are equally likely to dislike a given video as the larger self-selected group of people who view the video.  That’s pretty unlikely, as people who care enough about dislikes to get the extension are probably people more likely to dislike things."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"The amount of people that have this extension is a percentage of a percentage, you’d be a fool in any field of work to try to extrapolate an opinion based on that"
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"I'm one that uses that extention, and it's because prior to the removal of the dislike bar/count if you opened a video for something like ""How to clean your dryers lint trap"" (purely as an example) and you saw that it had 1 like and 25 dislikes, you would know that video probably shouldn't be trusted and you can move on to the next.

There are thousands to tens of thousands of how-to videos out there and being able to weed the bad ones out using the dislikes was a good way to make sure you were getting accurate information.

That's just one aspect of why removing the dislike button/bar was an anti-consumer decision."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,As long as you admit why YouTube removed the dislike total showing then you can think whatever you want.
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"Yes, exactly. Not only is it a very small sample, more importantly it is a very skewed sample. You probably don’t get this extension if you don’t go around disliking lots of videos. 

EDIT: the irony of this comment being heavily disliked is pretty funny. Possibly by people with the extension?"
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,And you’d be wrong because the source for that data is heavily skewed towards disliking themselves
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"No you can't. This is a textbook definition of a skewed sample. The only thing you can do with this, statistically speaking,  is be more likely to make enraged racists feel self satisfied."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,Yes I’m coping because I’m calling out an extension that doesn’t have direct data from Google as innacurate
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"I domt think ive ever disliked a YouTube video, dont really like then either.

I just like to know what the community consesus is. I may still watch it even if its negative, but it is extra information I like to have"
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"Do you really think people dislike a video because they can see the dislike number?? 

If they are more likely to press the dislike button then they probably didn't like the video in the first place. All the dislike number do, is urge them to press it. That doesn't change the fact that they don't like the video in the first place.."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"The extension came out before dislikes disappeared, so presumably they had time to calibrate for that."

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"Since you obviously have no fucking idea what you are talking about here is the original poem in English.

""The sound of creaking.
Mulan sits in the doorway in front of her loom.

When the loom grows silent,
We can only hear the sound of her sighs.

Girl, who are you thinking about?
Girl… who do you long for?

(Mulan replies)
“There is only one man I think about
There is only one man I long for

Last night I saw the conscription notice,
The Khan is issuing a great draft –

A dozen volumes of battle rolls,
Each one with my father’s name.

My father has no son old enough to take his place,
I, Mulan, have no elder brother.

I’m willing to buy a horse and saddle,
I will take my father’s place in battle.”

She buys a fine steed at the east market;
A saddle and blanket at the west market;

A bridle at the south market;
And a long whip at the north market.

At dawn, she leaves her parents’ home
and camps beside the Yellow River before dusk.

From far away, she cannot hear the sounds of her parents calling for her
Only the rushing waters of the Yellow River.

She leaves the Yellow River at dawn,
And reaches reach Black Mountain before dusk.

From far away, she cannot hear the sounds of her parents calling for her
Only the cries of the enemy cavalry in the Yàn hills.

She traveled ten thousand li,
She flew over mountains and through mountain passes

The sound of a war gong pierces the air,
The winter sun shines brightly on her coat of steel.

The general dead after a hundred battles,
The warriors return after ten years.

They return to see the Son of Heaven,
Sitting in the royal court

He unrolls the scroll of merit a dozen times
Giving hundreds and thousands of rewards

The Khan asks Mulan what she desires

(Mulan replies)
I have no need to be promoted to a prominent position

I only ask for a camel that can travel a thousand li
That can take me back to my hometown

Her parents hear that their daughter has returned,
They welcome her at the entrance to the town.

When Elder Sister hears of Mulan’s return,
she stands in the doorway wearing a beautiful dress

When Little Brother hears that his sister has returned,
He sharpens his knife to slaughter a pig and a lamb.

(Mulan speaks)
“I open the door to my eastern chamber,
And sit on the bed of my western chamber.

I take off my military robes
And put on my old clothes.

I sit in front of the window as I comb my long flowing hair
And look into the mirror as I apply makeup

I go outside to see my comrades
They are all shocked and astounded.

“We traveled together for twelve years,” (they say),
“But we never suspected that Mulan was a woman!”

Most people tell the gender of a rabbit by its movement:
The male runs quickly, while the female often keeps her eyes shut.

But when the two rabbits run side by side,
Can you really discern whether I am a he or a she?""

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"That's not easy to do well, especially not when you're planning bright lights and other stage issues. Anyone can do a lousy job of any color, and a skilled stylist can do a respectable job. But movies have more going on. I read about camera doubles once, and I was blown away. There's so much time spent standing on set while they fix lighting and other stuff that they'd use up the contracts for the actors. They hire people who have certain matching features."

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,You think Disney came up with the story?
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"Here's a hint...

No one fucking cares. We can tell the same *exact* story whether she's white or black, or brown, or yellow, red, doesn't fucking matter. The color of the skin plays exactly zero part in the plot. The only people that care this much are racists that don't want to admit theit racist but this still upsets them and they just can't vocalize why in any manner that makes sense. 

P.S. BIPOC care when their good characters arw white washed because they’ve been relugated to villians, monsters, criminals, gangbangers, and every other negative sterotype under the sun for the entirety of entertainment. It's not even close to the same and you know it."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,But how does it impact the plot in any way to have her be black? I'm genuinely confused. Her whiteness was never a plot point. It's never discussed. It truly does not matter.
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"So if it were up to you all remakes would be exactly the same as the ""original""? We'd have the same movies and shows every 10-20 years with not one tiny detail changed. This movie your honor, in the original this character had freckles!!!"
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"It’s an asinine argument, imho. This constant “what about the reverse scenario” is childish. I see people using this on other subs about male victims vs female victims. Same juvenile argument. IMO 

Rebooting BLACK Panther with a white person doesn’t make any kind of sense to argue. Making a new movie called WHITE panther and casting a white person would make sense. The Little Mermaid title doesn’t include a race defining word, e.g. The White Little Mermaid or The Black Little Mermaid. IMHO, this is a poor stance to take. 

Casting a non-white woman to play a red headed reboot shouldn’t bother one single person. I saw the trailer and thought the hair department could have kicked the color up a notch or two, because it looks orange to my eyeballs. But that’s the end of my opinion about the appearance actor. Her singing voice sounds amazing!

But who the heck *really* cares about a mermaid’s hair color???? So dumb!

I saw a video yesterday of a little girl watching the trailer and she got so excited because Ariel looked like her. It brought tears to my eyes. Why can’t we talk about that? The sheer delight for that child to identify with a lovely little mermaid. Grow up people and open your hearts! (This is to no one in particular and I’m not trying to fight with the person I’m replying to)"
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"no.  but they’re not rebooting a story about a race of white fish women, so they can do what they like."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"Or as a native-american. The character was created with a design in mind. If the writers of the reboot didn't even cared about the original design, are we really going to expect them to care about the more nuanced details of the character?"
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"Yes, the 1.5 million people disliking the trailer of a children’s movie is totally reasonable and valid. Makes so much sense."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"New characters should always be created. I completely agree. But traditional and archetypal stories are always being remade and adapted. 

There have been great retellings, but the majority of remakes are often terrible compared to the originals. But that has little to do with the ethnicity of an actor, but more the formula behind productions. I completely agree on this point. 

We lose when the balance between business and storytelling gets too out of whack."

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"You're forgetting the most important thing and I will repeat it: *the status quo in Hollywood has always been white characters.*

Race swapping African folklore (i.e. from black to white) is not the same thing as race swapping the Little Mermaid (i.e. from white to black). When 90% of the characters in any Hollywood production are white, there's only one direction to go to make it really reflect our current cultural makeup. And that's introducing more non-white characters."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"Then it wouldn’t be black panther would it? That would be a new character with a different story, because the history of the Asian continent and the African continent are not the same. The story would deal with different themes entirely and I wouldn’t have any issue with it. That’s a great example of a story where the character’s race and setting context matters. Now how does Ariel being black change the story in any way?"
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"Then it wouldn’t be Black Panther, get it? The story is fundamentally tied to the setting and race of the characters. You’re gonna find it tough to find an equivalent poc role because most of the time, poc weren’t given roles unless they HAD to be of a certain race.

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"Itll be weird is they put a different race for Mulan, Merida or Tiana.

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"I'll not speaking to him necessarily.

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"The thing is, it's not as if one is tied to the other at the exclusion of everything.

She was also naked and didn’t swim with a shell-bra - look at the statue based on the original in Copenhagen for how we Scandinavians visualized her. 

Disney made massive edits to the story in order appease American sensibilities and “virtue signal” the values of the time. E.g. in the original the prince has a bunch of female slaves (read: concubines) that the mermaid competes with for his affection. Disney has always adapted stories to the sensibilities of the time, because they are targeting kids."

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"Melanin makes hair black, pheomelanin makes hair red. Bright red hair makes a lot of sense since she has no melanin to cover up or darken the red hair. And she would likely have lots of pheomelanin. It is connected to another gene that allows red haired people to generate vitamin D more efficiently, we can even generate it with no sun which other hair colors cannot. That would be a perfect trait for living deep underwater.

But even if she had no melanin or pheomelanin, she still wouldn't be black. She would be albino instead. Albinos don't have any melanin, but their skin is white and their hair is white, not transparent."

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"So, is Howard Ashman working on **this** version of the movie?  I'm just checking, since you claim that he's the one that is deciding how this character is going to be portrayed.

And literally every one of their live-action remakes has been different from the original.  Some of them massively so (101 Dalmatians, Alice in Wonderland, or you could even include Hook in here).  

It really seems like you just want to watch the original, and shouldn't be commenting on this one at all.  Go watch the original, you'll love it.  Ariel is perfect in it.

Meanwhile, in just a few months, you can actually watch this movie, and find out if it's any good, instead of judging a production by 10 seconds of a song.

Edit: BTW, ability to sing doesn't mean that you aren't naive.  The actress is 22.  There are plenty of 22 year olds that are naive and innocent.  If you think that the ripe old age of 22 is enough to be definitely worldly and experienced, then I'm guessing that you're 21."

Also, examples of Hollywood casting white people as POC:

\- Natalie Wood, *West Side Story*, as a Puerto Rican woman  
\- Tom Hardy, *Dark Knight Rises* (fun fact - Bane is actually Latino in the comics)  
\- Tilda Swinton, *Doctor Strange*, as an Asian man  
\- Everyone in *21*, who were all white actors but based on real students who were Asian-American

But you’re mad about, a movie remake, casting someone with a slightly darker complexion, and you don’t see that maybe you’re view of race has gone too far?

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"[Their website](https://www.returnyoutubedislike.com/faq) explains the basics of how it works. They do not claim to provide a perfectly accurate ratio, but for the most part, it is able to provide a reasonable value that will give the viewer a proper idea of the feedback on that video. Of course, there can be exceptions where the count isn’t very accurate, but they’re presenting about the best data possible given their restrictions. It’s not a “random algorithm”, idk what “source code” you were looking at to draw that conclusion Lmao"
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"It’s probably unlikely their ratio is IDENTICAL, but it is likely that the ratio is similar. If the ratio is close to 1:1, it’s likely the real ratio is 1:1, if the ratio is largely positive, it’s likely the real ratio is likely positive, if the ratio is negative, it’s likely the real ratio is negative.  It is a completely reasonable tool to use to get an idea of the feedback on a video. It is NOT a good tool if you want a perfectly accurate number, but that isn’t what most people want. When I look at a like/dislike ratio, all I care about is the general ratio. I don’t care about the exact numbers and I’m assuming most don’t either.

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,YouTube removed the dislike because it didn't serve their commercial interests anymore.

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,Her race is irrelevant. The audition was race blind. They did not set out to cast a specific race. She was chosen as the best out of the auditions.

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"It has nothing to do with the plot.

I'm talking about her, as a character, as a design that is well established and existed before this. Now there will be Ariel and Black Ariel, and I'd rather just have Ariel and Anne the *original black mermaid character* by Disney who is her own person. Does that make sense?"
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"That's what I'm saying, exactly.

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"Hey guys, did you know that in terms of male human and female Pokémon breeding, Vaporeon is the most compatible Pokémon for humans? Not only are they in the field egg group, which is mostly comprised of mammals, Vaporeon are an average of 3”03’ tall and 63.9 pounds, this means they’re large enough to be able handle human dicks, and with their impressive Base Stats for HP and access to Acid Armor, you can be rough with one. Due to their mostly water based biology, there’s no doubt in my mind that an aroused Vaporeon would be incredibly wet, so wet that you could easily have sex with one for hours without getting sore. They can also learn the moves Attract, Baby-Doll Eyes, Captivate, Charm, and Tail Whip, along with not having fur to hide nipples, so it’d be incredibly easy for one to get you in the mood. With their abilities Water Absorb and Hydration, they can easily recover from fatigue with enough water. No other Pokémon comes close to this level of compatibility. Also, fun fact, if you pull out enough, you can make your Vaporeon turn white. Vaporeon is literally built for human dick. Ungodly defense stat+high HP pool+Acid Armor means it can take cock all day, all shapes and sizes and still come for more"
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"It absolutely is relevant. How do you think Disney, or any company adapting a work, settle on a design? They look at the source. The author was Danish and therefore described characters like white people. It's no different than anywhere else in the world. Black authors write prominently Black characters just as Asian cultures write stories with Asian characters and so on."

I don't think it's weird, surprising, or bad that when a region is made up of a majority of people who are a thing, that they tend to tell stories based on and around that thing.

Your last paragraph encapsulates perfectly why I hate most of todays movies and tv shows even though I was the biggest entertainment shill a decade ago.

  100/x == 10/1

So x=10

You do know that this is stuff that's easily looked up and verified, right?  Do I need to provide links, or can you use Google?

* The Jungle Book was both a box office and a critical success (massively on both parts).  
* In fact, the Jungle Book was also done as a live action remake in 1994, which was both critically and financially successful.  
* Pete's Dragon was a lesser known movie (for both versions), but was a significant critical success, and a modest box office success.  
* Cinderella in 2015 was another critical and box office success.  
* Beauty and the Beast is another with rave reviews, a high audience score, and the biggest financial success of the ones I've listed so far.
* And then you have the critical failures that still made a ton of money (which is really all that Disney cares about), Aladdin, 101 Dalmatians, Alice in Wonderland, and The Lion King.  BTW, these were all big enough to get a sequel or spinoff film (2 of these are still in the works). They're also 3 of the top 5 movies on this list for box office draw, including #1 (people really wanted to see the Lion King).

A lot of comic book movies on your mind. I struggle to see a lot of masculinity in these marvel movies but to each their own if you think that stuff is particularly exemplary of masculine male leads.

Maverick is definitely in that category, a call back to the masculine/macho movies of the 80/90’s.

Not poor Ariel being a ""slave"" who has less people commanding her than Cinderella, less restriction than Rapunzel, less political duty than Jasmine, less sexism experienced than Mulan.

And CM and BW just...aren't.  Haven't seen She-Hulk, but it has a internet bait intro to my knowledge, and that'll make a lot of people dislike the movie to begin with, regardless of party.

That still leaves Black Panther as an example of a Disney movie starting a black person that was well liked.  Your statement that it didn't do well is just FLAT wrong.  The movie is jerked off in high critic circles, and online, it has a LOT of people who were all like ""this us the shit, this is peak Marvel"".  It sold real well, too, but most every Marvel movie does tbf.

Also, I just remembered Wreck it Ralph.  Penelope is a central character in that movie, and yet you don't see much in the way of ""all my homies hate Penelope"" online.  Hell, I know it's not Disney, but Soul was pretty liked, and that starred a (initially) black dude in the movie.

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"Assume that the people using the addon are a random sample of the population. See how many people using it liked the video, scale known dislikes based on that.

So if there's 100K likes on the video and the extension users have 1K likes and 50 dislikes, you know that dislikes are 5% of likes. Extrapolate to full data and you get 100K likes and 5K dislikes.

To note, I don't know how it actually works, but that's one way that has **massive** problems starting from the fact that people who use the addon are not a representive random sample of users, and that extrapolating data 100 times over from a single data point is suuuper sketchy."

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"
>	It’s probably unlikely their ratio is IDENTICAL, but it is likely that the ratio is similar.

I highly doubt that it is similar. As a general rule of thumb, anything requiring user agency and not totally and completely random in statistics is usually thrown out for being unreliable. This is why call-in phone surveys never work. The people who do want to share their opinion are almost always overwhelmingly negative, and that same concept can be traced back to this app, where the abysmally small number of people who actually care about downloading it are very likely doing so to downvote other videos."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,Is it that similar though? Wouldn't those who are interested in dislike-bombing a video be the ones that would be most incentivised to use it to weight the estimation in their favor? By massively reducing the sample to mostly just those that use the extension every vote cast within that group has a much bigger effect on the ratio shown than back when everybody was locked into the same system.
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,I kinda doubt it’s 1:1 in this situation.

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"How can it have the same themes when the themes are directly tied to Africa’s history? Do you think every colonial story is just interchangeable? Black Panther is inherently tied to blackness, if you remove it, it’s not Black Panther. Ariel’s race on the other hand, has nothing to do with the story. If you want to make a counter example you have to pick a black character whose blackness isn’t related to the story. Like, idk, Michael Jordan in Space Jam maybe? It’s really hard to find an example, almost like black people were systematically barred from roles unless the character *had* to be black or something. 

There are white roles tied to whiteness. Atticus Finch can’t be separated from his whiteness for example. The Godfather has to feature an Italian American family, that’d be a hard sell if they weren’t white. It’s not like there aren’t any white roles. Ariel just isn’t one of them"
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"Do they though?  I almost guarantee you that none of Ariel's hairstyles or dresses would have been worn in 1830's Denmark.  Not to mention, were there tons of drag queens in Denmark in the 1830's?  Because Ursula's design was famously based on Devine, the American drag queen.  Is Ariel a traditionally Danish name?  No, it's not.  Do any of the characters speak in Danish or with at least a heavy Danish accent?  No.  These films aren't interested in historical accuracy in any area of their design, so I fail to see why race should be the one big exception."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"Yes, in the original work that would've been relevant. I'm saying it's not relevant here because it's not a 1:1 adaptation of the original work. It's an adaptation of the version Disney created which already takes major liberties with the source material. If the Danish influence was that important you wouldn't have environments looking as they did in the film or a crab with a carribean accent.

 Disney already made up a bunch of stuff when they created the animated version, including character designs. All they've done here is alter one aspect of one of the characters. That aspect being her skin color because it's not important to the story. 

They've done this before with their properties. The Broadway version of Frozen doesn't only hire white actors nor is the Broadway cast for Lion King exclusively black and so on."

The water is muddied when idiots like you come in here and say you don’t need the extension to dislike - because THATS NOT WHAT IM FUCKING SAYING.

I am saying that the DATA this extension presents is NOT ACCURATE AT ALL.  Because for it to count a dislike it needs to SEE the dislike.  Google does NOT allow people to pull the dislike count from the API.  

The only way for this extension to show “the number of dislikes” is if it is counting them (via people with the extension installed), and some other things it does to tweak those numbers.

It’s literally in the fucking extensions documentation.



So now we have the baseline established….  This is where it may get hard for you because it involves some logic:

Since this extension can only count dislikes from people it can see hit the button….  It means for your dislike to be “counted” in their database, YOU MUST HAVE IT INSTALLED.

And frankly, I find your last line to be insulting to Mr. Ashman.  He poured himself into a character that was so successful that 30 years later it's still inspiring a new movie.  That's amazing, and frankly, you should be ashamed to say that it is anything other than amazing.  

Meanwhile, you should probably look up the Disney remakes, some are shit, but others are great (101 Dalmatians, the Jungle Book, and Cinderella were all pretty damned good).  This one might be, or it might be the next Pinocchio."

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"No, you only care when they change the race. They change facts about characters in renditions all the time. It’s pointless to even claim a character has been established when a new person is recreating the story. Btw, they never, ever claimed Ariel was European. People are free to cast who they’d like, they’re not casting a cannon, eauropean mermaid as a black girl. They casted Ariel, who’s race hasn’t been stated, as a lightskin women as opposed to the previous white skinned Ariel’s. So?"
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"No it doesn’t…in black panther, you’re talking about a reclusive nation in central Africa. The whole plot of the movie depends on killmonger wanting to arm black communities around the world with wakandan weapons to fight back against oppressive, largely white, governments. Changing that necessarily changes the story. It also poaches a character that has been a key source of minority representation for decades.

It's not.

And that's why it can be changed without any noticeable difference in any of those things, thereby keeping the spirit of the original movie the same. 

The only difference is in the audience reaction, like yours, which is based on pure nostalgia, and a nonsensical adherence to race and skin color that is not needed, and only exists to please your desire for seeing something you loved as a child stay the same.

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"You're misinterpreting my comment. My point was that she's white in the original tale because the author was. So when Disney adapted the story, that carried over. Not much else did as you pointed out, not even the name. But because it carried over, the imagery that Disney created, that of a pale white girl with vibrant red hair and bright blue eyes, became THE definitive version of the character. 

I imagine few have read the book, most people could likely care less about it. But when you talk about the character of Ariel the imagery that comes to mind is what Disney created. The new actress has none of those descriptors so it makes sense that people are mad about it. I think if the first images shown from the film had some blue contacts and a brighter shade of red for her hair there wouldn't be many complaints."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"Im not exactly talking about the original work itself. Moreso it's influence on Disney's interpretation of that story. I think everyone can agree that the original has next to no culture relevance in the states and Disney's version is the standard. 

I don't care about the little mermaid or who plays her personally, but I do think that there's a reasonable expectation for her to look a certain way because that's the version everyone is familiar with.

It's like when they recast Morpheus in the new Matrix film. The entire time my brain is just thinking ""this isn't Morpheus"". You got Keanu next to not Lawrence Fishburne and it doesn't feel right. Another example is like Topher Grace as Eddie Brock in Spiderman 3. Eddie is a big dude in the comics and the iconic 90s cartoon series, but they got a skinny guy to play him instead and it just doesn't work. 

This isn't to say the actress can't do a good job of course. The director said she was the best pick and I truly believe that. She has a great voice and singing is kind of a big deal in Disney films. These are just examples of expectations not being met that lead to negative opinions of the work before release."

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,I agree with that. Instead of recycling we should get new stories. I’m a big fan of that. But it’s also not mutually exclusive. I think the bottom line comes down to what makes the character themselves. Being white is not what made any disney princess who they were. And so depicting them as a different race does nothing to damage their character. You hate remakes then by all means bash remakes. But the focus has not been on another shitty Disney remake.

There will always be idiots online, that's just how it be.  But taking those people and projecting them onto the whole disconcerted community isn't a good idea."
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"The story *cannot* work if Ariel is anything less than a completely naive, *very* teenaged ingenue. An older character, or even a character more mature for sixteen than the original was would be impossible to root for. She'd be seen only as a selfish, reckless asshole because she's old enough OR mature enough to know better. (Again, loosely paraphrasing Howard Ashman.)

I have no doubt that in order to make the romance more palatable, this version of the mermaid is not intended to be a teen. And her singing voice will make it impossible to think of her as young and naive as she needs to be, in order to be likeable in spite of all the selfish risks she takes. 

The fact that their filmmakers don't think these things through answers all questions about why Disney Animation hasn't made a worthwhile movie in years. 

I've seen the other remakes you suggested. They're all hot flaming garbage from a writing perspective, and no amount of visual splendor can make up for that.

Edit: Also, I didn't say that Ashman's work is anything less than amazing. I said that Disney both doesn't understand why the decisions he made for the character mattered, and that trying to do anything other than what he insisted upon for the character (that was a *very* personal creation for him) is both disrespectful and very, very stupid."

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"But race swapping for diversity's sake is something that annoys a LOT of people, not only white people.  I can guarantee you that if Miles Morales was redesigned to be white, for no discernable reason, a lot of black people would be pissed.  If Mulan was made white, a lot of Asian people would be pissed.  

People don't like when something is seemingly swapped around for diversity's sake in of itself.  Why is that?  Because it tramples upon the mental image someone had of that character, for no real reason.  That's why redesigns sometimes get thrashed, too, because the new ___ just ain't who the fanbase is used to.  

If Disney REALLY wanted to make a movie to appeal to diversity directed to black people, they'd make another black princess.  But they made another (hopefully not, but most likely) shitty live action adaptation, instead.

All that said, your connection to Jesus being inaccurately depicted still makes no sense to me.  This is a completely unrelated example, with different reasons for the change in skin color than him.  Also, this is MUCH more recent than Jesus's whitewashing.  It's still a stretch.

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"Atleast we agree on that.

Its true that being of a certain race is not what makes the character themselves, however, i argue that if the people don't even care about the design of the character to adapt him in live-action, is unlikely they will care about the more nuanced parts of the character.

I usually think of the death note adaptation of netflix for example. None of the characters look like the originals, so, you could argue that they just choose the best for the job and that the personality, which is what truly matters, is stellar? No, all the characters act in ways that the originals wouldnt. So, whats the conclusion here? That the characters act different because the characters were race-swapped? No, but that the writers didn't care about the story, which manifest in them not even caring about searching for accurate actors. It's not the reason a movie is bad, but it shows the interest that the writers have in the original story. Like, if you are referring to me that something like harrasment to the actors is bad, i agree (including the inverse like what Scarlett Johansonn suffered for ""ghost in the shell""), but using that as a justification for race-swapping, there i have to disagree."

That's great, but this isn't Howard Ashman's story.  It's inspired by his story, but it's not his story.  And in just a few months, we can watch *this* story and see if it works.

And again, if you're basing naivety on singing voices, then you need to see a therapist!  Seriously!  The actual human being that's acting in the role is 22.  She should be assumed to be naive until proven otherwise, regardless of her singing ability.  22 year olds are fucking idiots (some exceptions apply).  

Meanwhile, the last decade of Disney Animation feature films have won Academy Awards, critical praise, box office success, and include some of the most famous Disney characters and songs.  These include Encanto, Frozen, Moana, Zootopia, and a few others.  All successful.  

And frankly, if you think that The Little Mermaid (OG version) is great cinema, but also think that the 3 movies I mentioned are ""hot flaming garbage"" then you've blown any credibility that you had about movies (which wasn't much after the Disney Animation claim)."

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"No, my argument is that mermaids don't even exist but you've become convinced that these imaginary made up creatures have equivalent genetic characteristics to humans. 

You're not wondering how they breathe, how they can speak underwater, why they even have vocal cords, why they have hair on their heads, how they reproduce...no, you think all that makes perfect sense. You're good with that. What you cannot accept is that these imaginary creatures, that literally do not exist, have different skin tones than you think they should have. 

Using Wakanda as a way to dodge the question is a really bad tactic as well. Wakanda is a fictional place that's set in Africa, and key to the plot is that it is populated by an isolated community of indigenous African people. Unlike mermaids, indigenous African people do exist, and unlike the skin tone of the Little Mermaid, the ethnicity of Wakandans is fundamental to the entire premise."

I mean, Jesus is constantly depicted in pop culture as white. It's not only recent. It's constant.

Now could you argue that representation OVERALL matters? Sure!

It’s also sometimes done intentionally like how Hamilton swaps out the race of the founding fathers.

Fyi, you don’t seem to understand Disneys want to retell the same story. I agree with you on that but from a business perspective it renews their copyright on the characters ( albeit characters based on public domain characters originally lol ) 

I work in hollywood. The main stream is doing just what the music industry does and if you are a proud pirating person, it’s on you. 

Go back to the times of Elvis. Parents hated that music. He was , before his wild success, a huge fucking risk. 

However since music actually made money, they had enough of it to take gambles. 

Ever since streaming and pirating , hollywood, music, they go mainstream with tried and tested products. They have research teams at the costs of millions telling them what will work. Sure it doesn’t always translate but this is what we get for not contributing .

I know, do you think I’m standing up for the record companies for  Hollywood, but I’m not in reality. People like me who bust our ass we got affected first I could give a shit if Justin Bieber can afford to not afford another mansion, but I can tell you that the ripple effect affects everything from taking gambles, and putting out quality content. doing whats tried and tested works. It’s safe. Comic book movies etc. I had a friend who worked at CAA and had inside information, said that any Scripts coming their way had to have universe building, kind of like lord of the rings, or Game of Thrones, something that they could franchise and spinoff, and have tons of characters and multiple movies. 

You can’t get mad at Disney for doing what company is going to do and that is renew their intellectual property rights. By remaking the same things once in a blue moon.   You can simply vote with your wallet, and not go and not stream and not buy. 

 I but the fact is that simply casting this woman, more than likely was due to her, being the best person for the role. Let’s say Disney didn’t adopt a diversity at all costs, but simply adopted the ““ liberal mindset “of just being fair maybe that’s it, you can’t assume anything and the only proof you’re going off of his other people’s opinions of this.

To me remaking the film as a shot for shot remake but swapping in POC is a cheap pander that doesn't really increase diversity but looks more like token hiring. As other commenters have said, making a new story filled with better diversity would be a much better move. Like Frozen or Hamilton, fresh new stories."

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"Right that’s actually my point. The stories are from a white centric group and so have always been drawn white. But the race has absolutely nothing to do with their character. Ariel is in no way defined by her white skin. Snow White is defined by her skin color because that was the essence of beauty at the time. Whiteness had no impact on her character except to show how beautiful she was, the reason the queen was after her"
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"Yea dude you are totally conflating two things. You are picking an example where the race AND the defining features or a character changed and then using that as evidence that if you don’t care enough to use the original race of the character, you will not do justice to their core features. I wholly reject that notion. Let’s take heimdall. The Thor movies did a pretty good job with his actual character, so the race was a complete and total non factor. If you butcher a character you butcher a character. My point is that the aesthetic features are  very rarely what actually make the character who they are. One of the few places this is a defining feature is with traditionally jon white character, because white is such the default that a non white character tends to use their race as a major feature of their identity, like black panther. Whereas if tony stark was black, absolutely nothing is lost from the character"

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,So it makes more sense to just shoe horn in random people in this setting? There are nations of dark skinned people in middle earth already. It would make a much better story to have a character from one of those places involved in the story rather than just making random elves black. They could even make a half elf character who's black because they had a human parent. That would open up a whole bunch of story options. Instead they did none of that. The poor writing goes far beyond the casting choices. There are all sorts of things in the series that contradict the actual books.

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"Ashman coached Benson to sing more like a little girl and fought for Part of Your World to stay in the film when executive types wanted to cut it. You're clearly unwilling to recognize how essential it is that Ariel be seen as a very sheltered, painfully naive girl (based in part on Audrey Hepburn's role in Roman Holiday). The entire plot hinges on the understanding that this is a foolish but charming child who we should all want to see saved from the consequences of her actions. An 18 or 22 year old would not have been extended the same grace, according to the original filmmakers (and maybe Walt Disney himself, he'd spent decades trying to adapt the Andersen story.) Ariel and Aurora were the only Disney princesses (until Rapunzel I think) whose ages were stated explicitly. It was important that Aurora be understood to be that young too, so that all the selfish and foolish decisions she made would not likewise render her unlikeable. If Ashman felt so strongly that Ariel's singing voice had to be very specifically girlish to get the audience fully on board with the character, that's good enough for me. 

Again, the story does not work without Ashman's Ariel. All the same familiar beats *can* still be there, there's nothing stopping them since they don't give a shit. But Ariel will be an asshole without the benefit of the grace we're all willing to extend to our own idiotic 16 year old selves. At 22 most people would recognize that she should know better, unless they're going to go full idiot Kimmy Schmidt on the character. The beleaguered Sebastian being sent after her won't make as much sense either, nor will his growing affection for her as he sees how much she's in over her head through comparatively little fault of her own. Calling her a hopeless child with so much affection doesn't make sense when it's an adult six years older who he'd be completely right to be furious with, for putting her kingdom's future in the hands of a power hungry sea witch in order to gratify her own selfish desires. Even allowing a sixteen year old to more or less get away with that sort of thing is a stretch. All the more reason to make her sound as childish as possible. 

I've never said that Mermaid is some sort of cinematic masterpiece. You think in such black and white terms. Disney's recent writing has been shitty. It used to be slightly less shitty, thanks to a bit more internal consistency and a tad more giving-a-fuck. 

Take a look at the mid to low rated reviews for those films you mentioned. They *all* feature criticism of the writing, the characters, and the soullessness of the stories as a whole.  Hell, even the higher rated reviews mention lazy writing. ""Success"" by that standard, or the others you mentioned is no guarantee of quality. They also concede that they're willing to overlook the glaring faults in the writing because overall, they're tolerable movies for parents to watch with their kids. What tired parents will tolerate is not a great yardstick for quality, but as studios care less and less, what else can parents hope for?"

“Although red hair is an almost exclusively northern and central European phenomenon, isolated cases have also been found in the Middle East, Central Asia (notably among the Tajiks), as well as in some of the Tarim mummies from Xinjiang, in north-western China. The Udmurts, an Uralic tribe living in the northern Volga basin of Russia, between Kazan and Perm, are the only non-Western Europeans to have a high incidence of red hair (over 10%). So what do all these people have in common? Surely the Udmurts and Tajiks aren't Celts, nor Germans. Yet, as we will see, all these people share a common ancestry that can be traced back to a single Y-chromosomal haplogroup: R1b.”

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"Yeah, it only was made so i could give more context to my other comment.

The voice of a person doesn't necessarily match his appearance, but when it comes to actors in live action, you need both appearance and voice.

Fanworks tend to be done by people interested in the source material, with a much lower budget and limitations than big companies like disney. There i can understand that someone was casted as a certain character, even if that person doesn't match the appearance of the original. With gigantic companies like disney? Not so much.

The third one is more of the idea that if you are going to make big changes in a story, they should be based on the source material. If the writer originally created a character a certain way, but then changed the design, i think that its better if you use the original design than, say, create one for the movie that looks nothing like the original work"
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"You’re right it has no impact other to be low tier pandering.

I personally think race swapping is stupid, I’m a big proponent of sticking to canon, or writing something new. Just swapping a race is lazy and honestly should be offensive to people. 

When they made green lantern a black guy, they gave him a whole new story. So why isn’t Disney writing new stories around a black character instead of taking a 200 year old story and going “meh she’s black now”?"
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"I don't deny the existence of exceptions to the rule, however they are that, exceptions. The thing that i'm trying to say is how much can you take from a character until it's not the same character anymore. I argue that if you are making an adaptation, you will try to make it as close as possible to the source material, only making changes based on pacing and the change from different mediums. If you, howevwr, change a part of the character because ""i don't really care that much about it"", am i really going to believe that that sentiment is going to only stop at that? If this was a fanwork, thats a different story, as those people work with limits that this big companies do not have."

You are critiquing the 1989 movie, but substituting your own caricature of a different character that you've only seen 10 seconds of singing, and ignoring the fact that the 10 seconds is from a different movie.

And you didn't say that TLM was a cinematic masterpiece, but you're criticizing other similar quality movies and saying that they're garbage.  Meanwhile, if you look at reviews, it's not leaps and bounds better than the ones that you're saying are garbage.  You have a double standard and it's not me being black and white, but is you being blind to self-reflection on that.  And to be blunt, **anyone that dismisses every single remake as ""hot flaming garbage"", has no business saying that anyone else only sees things in black and white.**  

And as for the last paragraph, it's dismissed by looking at more than just the reviews that panned it.  ""If you look at only the reviews that said it was bad, then it's awful!""  Well, yeah.  The guy that hated Schindler's List probably thinks it's a shitty movie.  That doesn't make it a shitty movie.  (There is one bad review on Metacritic from the critics).

The fact is the majority of people don't tend to either like or dislike videos. The small majority that interacts with this feature probably tends to do \*both\* things often. Since the ""likes"" are still public, you do have an insight into how this small majority is interacting with the video, making it easier to predict the number of dislikes.

An analogy that'd make sense is if polling was only done among people who show some degree of political involvement outside presidential elections. For a country like mine, where voting is mandatory, the poll would probably be off. For a country like the US, where voting participation is low, it may as well reflect reality. Since liking/disliking a video isn't mandatory and is something only a tiny % of YouTube users actually do, their method might as well be working."

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"As I said before I’m not a big fan of the churning out of constant remakes. It just doesn’t make for good media to me. I agree it would be great to have more original stories with non white characters telling their own stories. But the outrage has not been about churning out another crappy remake, it’s about this notion of corrupting the original character by changing their race. And it’s very obvious because this specific backlash only tends to happen when a race is changed, not whenever a lazy remake is released. And another facet is that like it or not millions of kids grew up with these specific characters, white and non white kids. So there is definitely something meaningful in showing that these characters that everyone can identify with are not actually defined by their skin color but by their journey, their emotions and their personalities"
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"Thank you.

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"But you’re making up the rule as if it’s a thing. There’s no rule of race swapping. It’s not a thing. And changing race in most cases takes NOTHING from the character except the most superficial characteristic.

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,If Amazon had made that fictional world I would agree. If they wanted to ignore the story at every point they could have just made an original fantasy world. They just want to ride off the brand recognition of lord of the rings.
The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"Bet you can't come up with a plot featuring the most famous story beats from the original AND a more mature protagonist and have her come out likeable on the other side. Without, as I said, going full Kimmy Schmidt. 

It isn't possible. Especially not based on the original AND not when Walt Disney had tried to since the 40s, and others tried for decades on the version that came out in '89. Ashman's insight was the only thing that could have made it work. The Andersen story was far too dark and sad, being a story about a devastatingly painful loss of innocence that comes with a young person's introduction to the harshest realities of the world. Disney couldn't adapt it in any other way, not if they wanted to fit their brand and sell sparkly Mermaid barbies to the parents of little three year olds (me).

You're so insistent that the age and maturity level of the protagonist in the original don't matter (it's meaningless, your words) I'd like to know how you think the rest of the plot could be constructed. An adult disobeys her father (whose level of authority over her doesn't make sense), is interested in human stuff, meets a prince and rescues him. She has a fight with her father (shouldn't matter as much, as she's an adult, so Triton is unquestionably the asshole in that situation) and takes off spitefully to sign her voice over to a sea witch who she knows is not trustworthy. She makes the deal, as an adult, not having been coerced, to spite her father and get what she wants. She fucks over her father and the whole kingdom to get what she wants, and it's a short term benefit without any guarantee of it becoming permanent. Now she has to get the prince to fall in love with her. An adult woman throws herself at a prince, having given up her voice. With me so far? Still rooting for this character to get everything she wants? Mmkay.. Her father sends his trusted aide to keep his daughter out of trouble, but she's an adult.. so.. ? Daughter persists in her plans despite risks to the crab or anyone else. Sunk cost fallacy perhaps. It doesn't work, the witch wins a temporary victory, and the daughter is somehow not accountable, and still generally liked. Her father apologizes for being a dick. The end. 

At any point in the original, the question ""what is she thinking?!"" can be answered by ""she's a naive and overly sheltered kid."" That does not fly for a 22 year old, it doesn't matter how overbearing their parent has been. 

The opinion that Disney's remakes are hot flaming garbage (implying, apparently that some of their older films were not) is not an example of black and white thinking. You seem to fundamentally misunderstand the concept. Your statement that I'm comparing movies that are basically the same level of quality is based on your own opinion, not mine. The quality of all these movies is on a very wide range. I've never said otherwise. But yes, all of the live action remakes are garbage compared to most of the theatrically released Disney animated classics. It doesn't make them masterpieces, or make them all the same. It's ridiculous that your accusations have called for typing any of this out."

Apart from the other motive of fake diversity, of people seeing this as a way to show people of different races in the big screen instead of actually putting the effort to make stories with original leads of different races.

You say that you don't see a reason why a person would be against race-swapping characters outside of racism, i say that there's no reason to race-swap characters, and thinking that thats the way to generate diversity is racism, as, like i said, that is only seeing validity in originally white characters."

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"You replied to my post about Jesus calling it whataboutism. I told you why it's actually not whataboutism in the context of the current Ariel-is-black-now controversy.

You said people don't like when characters are race-swapped on principle. Because of mental images changing or some shit. I told you that doesn't hold true in the context of other race swaps. Most notably, nobody cared when Jim Caviezel played Jesus. Therefore, the arguments against Ariel being black are largely racist hypocrisy.

I should have included the concurrent bullshit outrage about LOTR Elves and GoT Incest Nobles but, alas, I missed that chance.

Then, after all that, you pretty much moved on from that because you don't personally care about Jesus being race swapped. That really proved my point, in a way.

You also assumed that I believe what you do, that the casting of Ariel was exclusively about diversity. I believe she was just the most qualified actress for the role. So, there's no use pursuing that thread.

And, finally yes: if a character whose ethnicity or nationality was important to their character had their race arbitrarily swapped, then people would be annoyed and rightfully so.

However, you just agreed that Ariel does NOT have a meaningful ethnic or national background.

I have you a reason. Millions of little girls who are not white grew up admiring Disney princesses, Ariel, belle, so on. Yes they absolutely deserve their own characters. They also deserve to see they are not excluded from every character of their childhood. There is a legitimate reason. Now what’s the legitimate reason that changing the race ruins the character? Because everything you are saying is either: 1. You don’t like remakes or 2. It’s forcing diversity- which I can only take to mean as you feel race is a defining feature of a character.

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"Your justification how a ""what about x?"" statement isn't actually whataboutism never actually disproved my point that they're just not a good pairing to make. If you want to show that Ariel's race change is like something else, so being mad at one requires being mad at another, lest you'll be a hypocrite, then use something that has origins that aren't from about 2 thousand years ago.  Similarly, don't use something that had different purposes behind the change than the thing you're connecting it to.  Otherwise, well, it just won't make sense and be too much of a reach, especially for a whatabout point.

Jim Caviezel played a character who was already swapped a LONG time ago.  It'd be more of a shock to common belief of what Jesus looked like if he was played by a moderately darker skinned man.  That's not really a good example of swapped race characters being given the thumbs up nowadays. 
Hell, even if it is a valid example, that is but one example against my point.  I never said that every single time a character's race or design changes it is meant with backlash and that's it, I said that it largely is the case (meaning there are exceptions) and it can be fine with fair reason.

That said, what's the lowdown on GoT incest nobility shenanigans and LOtR elves having outrage?  I'm fuzzy about the elves, and I'm clueless about the GoT issue.

And when did i say (or imply) that I don't care about Jesus being swapped around?  From what i recall, I've explicitly said it was stupid multiple times.

My point about you being concerned about Jesus's ethnic swapping (even though it has no inherent impact on the plot, while not having concerns about Ariel recieving the same treatment was regarding your hypocrisy over one situation being a no-no, while the other is fine.  It didn't have much to do with your belief that she was cast 100% for sure for reasons beyond diversity.  
To simplify, my concern was over your differing beliefs about two characters having their ethnicity changed in of itself, rather than over why they were changed.

And with your last paragraph, you not only helped cement your hypocrisy over Jesus' change being a no-no, while Ariel's is fine, but you also showed that you completely fuckin ignored my point about WHY people don't like writers fucking with beloved character's ethnicities or designs.  If you want to make someone change their mind, actually read and understand what they've said, rather than blowing over it.  Or at least, don't oust yourself in doing so."

If its a good show or movie it will usually be organic outrage getting blown out of proportion and it will die out very quickly, manufactured outrage tends to stick around a bit more, and start before the release of the product, and you will see TONS of srticles on it.

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,Honestly the more I think about your example the angrier I get. I now can’t see this any other way than you being a bigot. Here’s why. The little mermaid is the story of a teenage mermaid discovery herself and the world outside her home. Having a young black actress play Ariel does not change anything about that story. Dora the explorer is about a young child exploring her world and solving puzzles and challenges. Having a middle aged man play that character fundamentally changes the story. The fundamental nature of Dora cannot be captured by idris Elba. Their is absolutely no reason the fundamental nature of Ariel cannot be captured by Halle Bailey. But it seems to you that changing the race fundamentally changes the character. And sorry my dude but that makes you a bigot and your ridiculous comparison really drives that point home

The Little Mermaid makes Disney history as most viewed trailer with thousands of dislikes - ScreenNearYou,"You just said it…it’s iconic. Which means, it has its own ESTABLISHED history, story and characters. Why tarnish that iconic history by changing everything about the character? 

Just so we are clear, i would be just as upset if they changed Sabastian from a Jamaican sounding voice, to a New Jersey accent. That’s not Sabastian. We all know it, and it would cause us to have a visceral reaction to his new voice.

Where does the division come from? Because its absolutely from racists and reactionaries railing on the movie, not the other way around.

The original animated movie still exists, and will probably be a better movie than the live action (looking at other disney live action remakes). People will still watch it, its not being “replaced”. Also, its one (1) thing, not “every possible way”.

Of course, a person can get the jewelry wrong, as few people will notice, however, getting an actor that looks nothing like the original is something that people will notice. This is deliberately getting things wrong from the original.

Now, third time, you have the same objections with white-washing?"
