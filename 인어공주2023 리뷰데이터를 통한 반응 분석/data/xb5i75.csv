4,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek","Am I the only one who keeps reading Halle Berry instead of Halle Bailey? I tripped the fuck out when I saw the trailer and it wasn't Halle Berry and thought ' who the fuck is that!?"" Damn I'm old"
5,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek",My only problem with this movie is that it's happening at all.
6,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek","People should be more mad that the Disney version doesn’t end with Arielle turning into sea foam. Now THAT is not honoring the original.

Also, very excited for this remake cause I was a huge fan of the animated film!"
7,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek","I don’t care what color Ariel’s skin is, but if her hair isn’t red I’m not going…"
8,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek",What? Racists on the internet? Surely not!
9,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek",My favorite thing about Disney releasing new movies is all of the adults arguing about them as if they aren’t meant for kids.
10,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek",Can disney just stop making these freaking dumb remakes?
11,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek",They should have made this movie historically accurate…by casting a red haired manatee.
12,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek","When did fan reactions to things, racist or otherwise, become news? We're all perfectly capable of reading the comments and tweets ourselves. This is just amplifying the worst takes for clicks and it's nearly as bad as the takes themselves.

Maybe let's all just start downvoting these trash articles that keep popping up on the front page for some reason."
13,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek",Would be great if Disney just decided to make new movies and not a steady stream of remakes that all suck anyways.
14,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek",Literally the only complaint is that her hair is not brighter red. When I picture Ariel the first thing that comes to mind is firetruck red hair. Otherwise her voice sounds great and she looks fantastic.
15,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek","The story originated in Denmark. As a Dane, I feel it is my duty to always, ALWAYS, protect the TRUE image of the little mermaid....lol. she was GREEN. And Ugly.   


Regardless, the girl has presence and chops. As a Dane, I approve."

19,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek","All that teaser told me was that there was gonna be a LOT of oversinging done in the songs. Much like the end credit ""How Far I'll Go"" version in Moana. I get adding their own flare but damn it's too much. Much also like some singers do with the national anthem at sporting events."
20,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek","If this is what the entirety of the social media marketing is going to be, then I’m just not interested in these projects.

21,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek",I’m so excited to watch it. Being white has zero to do with the story so it shouldn’t matter
22,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek",Nobody is talking about the fact that her OTHER HALF is being played by a dolphin!  That's not even a fish!

24,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek","I feel like this is all part of their plan at this point, since most of these remakes have been mediocre at best. Swap a couple white characters with black actors, wait for the inevitable hate it will generate, and use that to try and draw more people to the theaters."
25,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek","It looks really good and I hope I like it better than the other live action remakes. Beauty and the Beast with Emma Watson was....bad. I wanted to like it but nope. I didn't even go see the Aladdin remake because I'd heard bad things. 

The actress looks beautiful. She even kind of resembles the cartoon Ariel with her large doe eyes. Her voice is AMAZING. I'm cautiously hopeful, but Disney, you've burned me twice with your live action movies. You better not autotune anyone. And your musical sequences need to not suck. I'm still having nightmares over ""Be Our Guest""."
26,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek","Hollywood hates casting white red heads as the lead role. Name me 5 movies (without looking it up), where the lead role has been a pastey red head. I'll wait lol. It's great to be inclusive, but let's include some gingers too."
27,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek","I really wasn’t sold on her, until I heard her sing. Ariel’s voice is central to the story and Halle Bailey has the voice of an angel."
28,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek","She shouldn’t get hate for a part she got casted to play. 

However there does seem to be a shift in how certain female characters are casted with women of color: Annie, Selina Kyle, Starfire, Tinker Bell, Ariel, Annabeth Chase, Domino, April Jones, Anita Darling. 

I feel that main argument here is if the color of skin truly does not matter, so long the character is portrayed how they need to be…can the same argument be made when Bruce Wayne is played by an Asian actor, or James Bond by a Black Latino  or Goku be Middle Eastern?

If the whole idea that these characters are not real and their real life adaptation can be up to interpretation—then why is there such a fuss? Shouldn’t anyone/everyone feel free to depict them? Or am I still missing something…?"
29,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek","I'll be honest. The movie looks dumb and I don't care for it. I think it will tank like the live action Lion King and Mulan. I do like the actress and she can sing. I might watch it for laughs.

















I'm sorry, but from the trailer I just know the cgi is going to be horrible. It didn't even look like she was in the water. It looked like some sort of reflection from a green screen or something. 
Also I know they didn't throw that ugly red wig on her head. 



















I think that some movies don't need a live action remake and this is one of them. Not to mention, I would rather see more movies about black princesses than make a white one black. 






















I do think that Ariel should have been left as a white woman. From how I understand, she was a Danish children's tale. I wouldn't want to see a white Tiana from Princess and the Frog. 






















I feel like there are so many African American or even just African stories that Disney could pull from. Hell, make a movie about a black mermaid. 





















I don't think that she should recieve racist comments for it. As a Black woman, I don't condone the fact that she is recieving hate comments. 















Those are my thoughts. Honestly, I see this as Disney trying to appease black people. Instead of making another black princess movie that's not a horror like Princess and the Frog is."
30,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek",Her eyes are very far apart. Definitely part fish.
31,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek",It just looks boring. Not to mention they haven't had one live action that was truly impressive.

I don’t doubt there are racists saying racist shit about this movie. But from what 99% of the population sees, race has nothing to do with it. It’s another live action movie in a long line of live action movies made for the sole purpose of protecting their IPs from the inevitable copywrite ending as well as to bolster their Disney subscriber numbers. It’s clearly a company just putting out something mediocre then getting defensive when they’re called out."
41,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek",Don’t care about her race. She looks 8 and literally every Disney remake has sucked.
42,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek","As a black person this so exhausting. The trailer was beautiful, her voice is amazing I hate that the central focus for some is the colour of her skin. It’s disgusting and I’m tired, just tired."
43,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek","The media do this every time. A couple of morons taint everyone. These people need to be ignored.

The braids also make more sense for underwater life, anyway! C’mon, this isn’t *such* a stretch."

51,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek",The trailer just looks bad.  The last scene she just looks like sitting on a a theater stage on a rock with mermaid suit and using lighting effects to give it the caustic look.

Aladdin was my favorite movie growing up and it was butchered so horribly in the remake.

At least for the little mermaid they chose someone who can sing and we don’t have to go through Emma Watson scenario (not awful) but def not broadway singing capabilities"

68,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek","I bet she's gonna do great as Ariel. I get that it's just a teaser, but I feel like Disney picked a bad scene to tease with. It's just dark and very static. Her singing is terrific but they couldn't have used her up on the rock with the wave splashing around her like at the end of the song in the animated version?

If people should be complaining about anything, it's Disney's re-hashing of movies they've already made in beautiful 2D animation with generic looking CGI."

71,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek",Would it he wrong to cast an originally black character as indian or asian?

75,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek",I love how people are more focused on the CGI or if a remake should happen than their fellow whites obsession with black people and lifelong commitment to racism.

In contrast to the little mermaid that does not have a cultural racial significance or lives within a sea that is defined by the populations race and culture as a certain race, it does not matter what race Ariel is

I bet the same person that made this comment didn’t complain when evangelicals made Jesus white…"

Let’s also break that down even more: people are heatedly tweeting hate speech because the mythical creature that is half-woman and half-fish and lives in the ocean and has her voice stolen by a sea witch in exchange for legs.

She’s a mermaid. It would have been cool to see less human and more mystical creature.

156,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek","You know what I thought was interesting about the Disney movie, her father seemed to only have daughters right? Was he sad he had no sons which would have been a bigger deal back in ancient times? Also granted, it’s been years since I’ve seen the movie but what happened to Ariel’s mother? Did the evil sea witch kill her? Also we are to assume Prince Eric is European right? Was he of British heritage? Also Ariel’s dad reminded me of Zeus and Ursula reminds me of a monster in Greek mythology. Is that coincidence or did the Danish author take ideas from Greek mythology?"
157,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek",What is anybody complaining about? It sounds like her voice is on point for the role. Is that not the most important feature for Ariel?
158,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek","The issue is no one is ever going to be completely happy with one thing or another in a Disney remake.

It follows the original too closely, it doesn't follow it closely enough, they cut this part out, they added this part in, the actor who plays character X is too different from how the previous actor portrayed character X, character Y is too (physically or otherwise) different from how they were portrayed in the original.

As it is, a 60 second teaser trailer isn't nearly enough to get a full opinion on a full length movie. I have my reservations, but until I see more than just a few seconds of a girl underwater in a dark cave, I'm going to hold back on having an actual opinion."

I hope Disney don't fall into the trap Rings Of Power did. I never seen anyone talk about race apart from your usual right wing YouTubers until the Amazon's marketing team started engaging. Then it started blowing out of proportion until almost every coverage about ROP is about the race. HBO did not engage and now no one cares about the race bent characters on House Of The Dragon while Rings of Power PR is nothing about the show itself but all about being on defense about their choices.

That kind of PR turns off everyone, even those who didn't care in the first place. No wonder HOTD had a more successful rollout because the coverage on it is all about how good it actually is instead of ROP's coverage all about how inclusive it is and how the previous LOTR stars support the changes Amazon made. 

Social Media algorithms are set based on engagements so when they start pushing content on everybody's feed they'd go with what's being engaged the most. Never searched for ROP but all the post leaking on my feed is always about the race of actors playing it while HOTD posts leaking on my feed are all memes made out of the latest episode."

193,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek","I just have no idea how they’re going to make this movie look good. If it’s anything like the live action Lion King, it’s going to try way too hard to look realistic in a creepy way - which is going to be particularly unattractive to the eye in an underwater setting. The original cartoon looked great because of all the vibrant colors and exaggerated humanoid sea creatures. Nemo was able to pull it off because of the art style not trying to be realistic… this doesn’t seem to be the case with TLM. We got a glimpse of Flounder in the trailer and I have a feeling he got so little screen time because he probably looks like a creepy talking fish. I’m thinking bluish-yellowish Big Mouth Billy Bass creepy. Hell, just imagine how bad Sebastian is going to look in live action. This movie was probably a bad idea from an art perspective but who cares if it’s profitable I guess."

I’m not the demographic this is aimed at and here I am upset about the shitty graphics (or whatever) lol. Adults forget that we’re adults sometimes.
232,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek","The way people bitched about the trailers, you would think they were going to be strapped to a chair and forced to watch on repeat."
233,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek",“New” movies. It’s literally targeted at adults who saw the OG’s as kids.
234,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek","The worst complaint is when people say ""these kids aren't mature or acting like adults"""

241,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek","Not sure where this sentiment comes from. A lot of these movies like Pinocchio, The Jungle Book, The Little Mermaid, etc are all clearly nostalgia bait. Sure, kids are part of the audience with a family friendly movie they want hit but nostalgia bait movies like this are clearly targeted at adults first for member berries."

248,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek","It's all a cash grab. Even though people find the remakes dumb or pointless, it also seems people are still going to see them anyway. As they're pumping boat loads of money for Disney.

Aladdin's budget was about $183M. It was critically panned mostly. And people were writing the movie off as bad just off the trailers. It still went on to make about $1B in the box office...same thing with The Lion King. A $250m budget. Not favored highly by critics or the audience. Went on to make $1.66B.

If Disney can make billions off of these lazy live action remakes then they don't have a reason to stop."
249,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek","It's free money for them, and the audiences who see them do enjoy them too."

259,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek","Or both, like the Gargoyle’s franchise. 

That would slap as a live action. And hey, the police officer Elisa, who is a main character, is interracial (black and native American)."
260,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek","I mean, they do that too. To a much higher degree"
261,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek","I mean, if they make lots of money on adaptations, why stop what works for them? People didn’t *have* to see Aladdin, but they did and that made at least $1 billion worldwide. The jungle book live remake just under $1 billion. The CGI Lion king remake more than $1.5 billion. If people are watching these movies to make around a BILLION dollars worldwide, why would Disney stop? Even if the remakes suck, tens of millions of people are watching these movies anyway, so clearly there’s a market for them."

But worst of all was the Lion King. Ever since the Lion King remake, I have had a passionate distaste for any live action remakes Disney decides to pump out."
282,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek",I actually like the Beauty and the Beast remake. Same with Aladdin. Lion King was bad though.
283,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek",Aladdin was good. Lion King was trash
284,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek","Yeah, the live BatB was not good. The ‘be our guest’ scene was weird. Like, you’re a 16th century peasant, I feel like seeing that whole display would get more of a reaction. It must be really hard to act with only a green screen, though."
285,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek","Having seen the Broadway version of ""The Little Mermaid"" (I miiiight be a fan girl), I look forward to the live action. Especially if it keeps the Broadway backstory of how Tritan screwed his sister Ursula out of half the kingdom.

That said, maybe Disney should put that effort into something original instead. Since I can't think of any African fairy tales off the top of my head, I assume any movie based on one would be unique."
286,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek",Princess and the Frog is based on a German fairytale and it adapted just fine.  Brandy played Cinderella in the ‘90s and it was fine.  Just because racists are complaining doesn’t mean there is anything wrong with this casting.
287,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek","Feels kinda cringe lately how around almost every corner there is somebody complaining about something that doesn't really matter to the audience focus.

Maybe I spend too much time around Nintendo communities but it often is just 30 year olds pissed off games aren't hitting the same dopamine levels of nostalgia they had when they were younger going off for hours about how childhood with the Gamecube is better than your childhood with the Switch.

It's like God damn let people enjoy things.

Not complaining at you OP of comment just adults that shouldn't even give a fuck about things. Oh god **am I like that too**."

290,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek","This is what I’ve said since she was cast.

Edit for all you fucknuts downvoting me: Ben Affleck,  a white man, played Tony Mendez in Argo, Christian Bale and Joel Edgerton played ancient Egyptians in Exodus: Gods and Monsters,  Jennifer Connelly playing an El Salvadorian in A Beautiful Mind, Jim Sturgess and Kate Bosworth in 21 as asian americans, Mena Suvari in Stuck was actually an African American woman......I could literally go on with this whitewashing list for decades.

331,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek",Have you heard her sing?!? It’s not inclusion for inclusion’s sake. Her skin color makes absolutely no difference to the story.

Now, I can believe it in some instances. But seriously where is the overlap between people who like and care about The Little Mermaid and vehemently racist assholes. And if we say there isn't much of an overlap and its just trolls being racist to instigate, then paying them any attention at all is stupid...Unless of course its good for marketing.

And you will also generate shills who, despite the quality of the movie, will feel the need to defend it regardless because if they were to be too critical then it would seem like ""the racists won."" You couldn't come up with better marketing if you tried."

386,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek","I think Disney relies on nostalgia to get bigger audiences when making these remakes, but I think they’re still made for kids that the rest of the family will still enjoy. Or even if it’s “aimed” at the adults, it’s also made in a way for the kids to enjoy it. The music, the humor, the generally basic story. Kids watch live action shows on Nickelodeon and Disney, so it’s not like live action is a problem. And they probably don’t care about “oh it’s a remake” since there’s a good chance a lot of today’s children haven’t watched or care about a movie that’s more than 3 decades old that they didn’t get to watch in a movie theatre."

I don’t have an issue with the casting, per se, but in my head it’s too much of a change up. Ultimately it doesn’t matter cause I probably won’t see it.

He is all about Raya and the Last Dragon though.  LOL.  But this is obviously just my experience.  He's still young and definitely prefers animated movies now, but maybe he'll be into these remakes when he's a bit older."
508,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek",You might be right. Maybe the target audience is in the tween age range (the age watching live action shows on Disney and Nickolodean). I have a younger child (6 years old) and he couldn't care less about the live action remakes.  He's definitely only into animated movies and shows right now.
509,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek","Funny you mention that, I tried watching that last night and feel asleep after a half hour. I'm 36. My kids, 6 and 8, liked it though"

511,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek","I mean, I’m sure they are meant for kids, but I don’t disagree with the person you’re responding to entirely. I think that they’re targeting kids AND nostalgic adults — not just kids. And I think the adults care more about them than kids do. 

I literally work with kids and none of them have a live action Disney movie as one of their favorites. They’re into animated movies like Frozen or into animes or into family franchises like Star Wars. The live action Disney movies are too … I’m not sure ‘dour’ is the right word, but they don’t seem to appeal to kids much. Again, I have yet to meet a child who obsesses over one of the live action Disney movies the way they’d obsess over Frozen or Dragonball Z or even some of the original Disney princesses. They’re not necessarily bad movies and kids can watch and enjoy them, but they don’t seem to have much of a long term, strong appeal to kids."
512,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek","And Star Wars, Star Trek, Marvel, DC, Rick & Morty, the Matrix, Battlestar Gallactica, Stranger Things, Jurassic Park, The Boys, South Park, and the office.

515,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek","If she’s playing Ariel, then that’s bad casting.

516,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek","Considering the primary audience for these movies is children, I think it's okay for them to exist. 

Until Disney+, Disney was pretty cagey about giving access to their classic films in home media offerings, and they aren't typically in the business of re-releasing them in theaters. So with that being said, there's not much harm in giving parents and kids the opportunity to see a modern interpretation in the theaters."

561,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek",That's the thing. Theyre fairytales. There's something transcendent about them. They’ve been told and retold depending on the culture or country. Cinderella started off as an Egyptian myth. Beauty and the Beast has its roots in the myth of Eros and Psyche. Many cultures have borrowed stories from each other and modified them and put their own stamp on them. So if Beauty and the Beast is a valid retelling of a myth why can't modern retellings also be valid?

As a kid the only ones I liked from before I was born was Beauty and the Beast and Aladdin, which was like a year before. Any movies older I didn’t really care although I did watch Peter Pan at least a few times, but the older the art forms the less I was engaged with the movies. But I was interested in live remakes - like the Pinocchio movie with the kid from Home Improvement. And the Brandi/Whitney Houston Cinderella. And even the 200-whenever adaption of Peter Pan (which, I don’t think is good, but I was interested in it anyway)."

580,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek","How is playing Ariel bad casting and a physical fact? The character isn’t real and isn’t ethnically tied to anything. She’s a mythical creature that lives in the ocean. Mulan is a based on a Chinese legend, so a non-Chinese actress would be weird. Aladdin is an Arabian location, so it’d be strange for a black actress to play her. If she was cast as “Prince Charming” and referred to as a male, rather than a specified gender swap where they reworked it to be a “Princess Charming” figure, yeah, that’d be weird.

But the little mermaid is… a mermaid. If anything maybe her skin could be green since she’s a mythical creature. Disney characters often defaulted to white unless they told a story specifically set somewhere of a different culture or was a character of a specific race. Ariel as a character can physically be whatever race/ethnicity for the story. Being non-white doesn’t change her story as a mermaid who becomes human."

They’re repackaging last weeks meal and trying to pass it off as gmo-organic-cage free nonsense when we all know they’re going to butcher it just like the last live actions.

If that doesn’t make sense then what I’m saying, in conclusion, is that they’re taking advantage of childhood favorites by “updating” then when no one wanted or asked for them in the first place- just to make $$ on memories.

642,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek","It was just a one-off event, not a series. I just meant that I agreed with you."

644,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek","I think when used to newer animated styles, the old ones look… quite old haha. Maybe he’ll like the old 2-d ones someday, maybe even the live action. To me, The live-action movies and remakes, at least allows today’s kids to have another option of exposure to the stories and kinds of characters many of us appreciated when we were younger. And in general, I feel like some changes in characters, whether simple casting or changes in dialogue and behavior, prevents watching something that could be a shot-for-shot remake. If it’s a fresh new take, I don’t need or care to see a live carbon copy of an old movie. ~$10 or whatever per person just to watch the same thing with nothing new besides no animations seems like a waste of money"

Listen they could do a black take on the little mermaid but make change the plot a little. Make it different and original. Or do a more realistic take that wouldn't scare the children. Although if kids can watch Princess and the Frog and not be traumatized then they should be fine."

The actress looks beautiful. She even kind of resembles the cartoon Ariel with her large doe eyes. Her voice is AMAZING. I'm cautiously hopeful, but Disney, you've burned me twice with your live action movies. You better not autotune anyone. And your musical sequences need to not suck. I'm still having nightmares over ""Be Our Guest""."
688,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek","Hollywood hates casting white red heads as the lead role.

689,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek","I really wasn’t sold on her, until I heard her sing. Ariel’s voice is central to the story and Halle Bailey has the voice of an angel."
690,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek","She shouldn’t get hate for a part she got casted to play. 

However there does seem to be a shift in how certain female characters are casted with women of color: Annie, Selina Kyle, Starfire, Tinker Bell, Ariel, Annabeth Chase, Domino, April Jones, Anita Darling. 

I feel that main argument here is if the color of skin truly does not matter, so long the character is portrayed how they need to be…can the same argument be made when Bruce Wayne is played by an Asian actor, or James Bond by a Black Latino  or Goku be Middle Eastern?

If the whole idea that these characters are not real and their real life adaptation can be up to interpretation—then why is there such a fuss? Shouldn’t anyone/everyone feel free to depict them? Or am I still missing something…?"
691,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek","I'll be honest. The movie looks dumb and I don't care for it. I think it will tank like the live action Lion King and Mulan. I do like the actress and she can sing. I might watch it for laughs.

















I'm sorry, but from the trailer I just know the cgi is going to be horrible. It didn't even look like she was in the water. It looked like some sort of reflection from a green screen or something. 
Also I know they didn't throw that ugly red wig on her head. 



















I think that some movies don't need a live action remake and this is one of them. Not to mention, I would rather see more movies about black princesses than make a white one black. 






















I do think that Ariel should have been left as a white woman. From how I understand, she was a Danish children's tale. I wouldn't want to see a white Tiana from Princess and the Frog. 






















I feel like there are so many African American or even just African stories that Disney could pull from. Hell, make a movie about a black mermaid. 





















I don't think that she should recieve racist comments for it. As a Black woman, I don't condone the fact that she is recieving hate comments. 















Those are my thoughts. Honestly, I see this as Disney trying to appease black people. Instead of making another black princess movie that's not a horror like Princess and the Frog is."

I don’t doubt there are racists saying racist shit about this movie. But from what 99% of the population sees, race has nothing to do with it. It’s another live action movie in a long line of live action movies made for the sole purpose of protecting their IPs from the inevitable copywrite ending as well as to bolster their Disney subscriber numbers.

In contrast to the little mermaid that does not have a cultural racial significance or lives within a sea that is defined by the populations race and culture as a certain race, it does not matter what race Ariel is

I bet the same person that made this comment didn’t complain when evangelicals made Jesus white…"

Let’s also break that down even more: people are heatedly tweeting hate speech because the mythical creature that is half-woman and half-fish and lives in the ocean and has her voice stolen by a sea witch in exchange for legs. 

But the fish-woman has a different skin tone. That simply will *not* stand.

Was he sad he had no sons which would have been a bigger deal back in ancient times? Also granted, it’s been years since I’ve seen the movie but what happened to Ariel’s mother? Did the evil sea witch kill her? Also we are to assume Prince Eric is European right? Was he of British heritage? Also Ariel’s dad reminded me of Zeus and Ursula reminds me of a monster in Greek mythology. Is that coincidence or did the Danish author take ideas from Greek mythology?"

820,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek","The issue is no one is ever going to be completely happy with one thing or another in a Disney remake.

It follows the original too closely, it doesn't follow it closely enough, they cut this part out, they added this part in, the actor who plays character X is too different from how the previous actor portrayed character X, character Y is too (physically or otherwise) different from how they were portrayed in the original.

As it is, a 60 second teaser trailer isn't nearly enough to get a full opinion on a full length movie. I have my reservations, but until I see more than just a few seconds of a girl underwater in a dark cave, I'm going to hold back on having an actual opinion."

I hope Disney don't fall into the trap Rings Of Power did. I never seen anyone talk about race apart from your usual right wing YouTubers until the Amazon's marketing team started engaging. Then it started blowing out of proportion until almost every coverage about ROP is about the race. HBO did not engage and now no one cares about the race bent characters on House Of The Dragon while Rings of Power PR is nothing about the show itself but all about being on defense about their choices.

That kind of PR turns off everyone, even those who didn't care in the first place. No wonder HOTD had a more successful rollout because the coverage on it is all about how good it actually is instead of ROP's coverage all about how inclusive it is and how the previous LOTR stars support the changes Amazon made. 

Social Media algorithms are set based on engagements so when they start pushing content on everybody's feed they'd go with what's being engaged the most. Never searched for ROP but all the post leaking on my feed is always about the race of actors playing it while HOTD posts leaking on my feed are all memes made out of the latest episode."

855,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek","I just have no idea how they’re going to make this movie look good. If it’s anything like the live action Lion King, it’s going to try way too hard to look realistic in a creepy way - which is going to be particularly unattractive to the eye in an underwater setting. The original cartoon looked great because of all the vibrant colors and exaggerated humanoid sea creatures. Nemo was able to pull it off because of the art style not trying to be realistic… this doesn’t seem to be the case with TLM. We got a glimpse of Flounder in the trailer and I have a feeling he got so little screen time because he probably looks like a creepy talking fish. I’m thinking bluish-yellowish Big Mouth Billy Bass creepy. Hell, just imagine how bad Sebastian is going to look in live action. This movie was probably a bad idea from an art perspective but who cares if it’s profitable I guess."

870,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek","Yeah. Sucks that racists will be racists and so criticism like yours (which is valid and honestly applicable to all Disney live-action remakes) will not be taken on its face but get subsumed in the rightful push back against racists. 

Racists just ruin shit for everyone."

875,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek",I have an issue with the casting. Specifically Melissa McCarthy as Ursula. She has entirely the wrong humour and presentation style for a character based on Divine.

877,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek",People would lose their minds if you made a version that was faithful to the original text. Same with anything from the Grimms Brothers.

881,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek",When I heard my mind went scientific and was like how does a creature that lives on the ocean floor have any dark pigmentation at all she should be white as a ghost as darker pigmentation is not necessary with very little sun then again she also would not have any good eyes. The whole concept of mermaids is weird
882,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek","She has red locs. Looks fine imo, but this is also an underwater shot so it would probably be brighter in better lighting"

891,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek","I don't think these remakes *are* meant for kids.  Kids like the newer animated movies.  They are less interested in these live action remakes than the adults who grew up with the originals.  Disney is relying a lot on nostalgia, when they remake these older animated movies."
892,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek","The Lion King (2019) made 1.6 billion in the box office to become the 8th highest box office of all time. As long as it keeps working, they’ll make these crappy remakes because it’s stupid for them not to. 

The remakes are made for whole families. Butts in seats. It’s a safe, wide appeal with good enough stories and highly funded visuals."

910,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek","It's all a cash grab. Even though people find the remakes dumb or pointless, it also seems people are still going to see them anyway. As they're pumping boat loads of money for Disney.

Aladdin's budget was about $183M. It was critically panned mostly. And people were writing the movie off as bad just off the trailers. It still went on to make about $1B in the box office...same thing with The Lion King. A $250m budget. Not favored highly by critics or the audience. Went on to make $1.66B.

If Disney can make billions off of these lazy live action remakes then they don't have a reason to stop."
911,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek","It's free money for them, and the audiences who see them do enjoy them too."

913,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek",No they already announced all the remakes they were working on years ago. None of this is new.

921,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek","Or both, like the Gargoyle’s franchise. 

That would slap as a live action. And hey, the police officer Elisa, who is a main character, is interracial (black and native American)."
922,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek","I mean, they do that too. To a much higher degree"
923,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek","I mean, if they make lots of money on adaptations, why stop what works for them? People didn’t *have* to see Aladdin, but they did and that made at least $1 billion worldwide. The jungle book live remake just under $1 billion. The CGI Lion king remake more than $1.5 billion. If people are watching these movies to make around a BILLION dollars worldwide, why would Disney stop? Even if the remakes suck, tens of millions of people are watching these movies anyway, so clearly there’s a market for them."

But worst of all was the Lion King. Ever since the Lion King remake, I have had a passionate distaste for any live action remakes Disney decides to pump out."
944,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek",I actually like the Beauty and the Beast remake. Same with Aladdin. Lion King was bad though.
945,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek",Aladdin was good. Lion King was trash
946,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek","Yeah, the live BatB was not good. The ‘be our guest’ scene was weird. Like, you’re a 16th century peasant, I feel like seeing that whole display would get more of a reaction. It must be really hard to act with only a green screen, though."
947,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek","Having seen the Broadway version of ""The Little Mermaid"" (I miiiight be a fan girl), I look forward to the live action. Especially if it keeps the Broadway backstory of how Tritan screwed his sister Ursula out of half the kingdom.

That said, maybe Disney should put that effort into something original instead. Since I can't think of any African fairy tales off the top of my head, I assume any movie based on one would be unique."
948,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek",Princess and the Frog is based on a German fairytale and it adapted just fine.  Brandy played Cinderella in the ‘90s and it was fine.  Just because racists are complaining doesn’t mean there is anything wrong with this casting.
949,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek","Feels kinda cringe lately how around almost every corner there is somebody complaining about something that doesn't really matter to the audience focus.

Maybe I spend too much time around Nintendo communities but it often is just 30 year olds pissed off games aren't hitting the same dopamine levels of nostalgia they had when they were younger going off for hours about how childhood with the Gamecube is better than your childhood with the Switch.

It's like God damn let people enjoy things.

Not complaining at you OP of comment just adults that shouldn't even give a fuck about things. Oh god **am I like that too**."

952,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek","This is what I’ve said since she was cast.

Edit for all you fucknuts downvoting me: Ben Affleck,  a white man, played Tony Mendez in Argo, Christian Bale and Joel Edgerton played ancient Egyptians in Exodus: Gods and Monsters,  Jennifer Connelly playing an El Salvadorian in A Beautiful Mind, Jim Sturgess and Kate Bosworth in 21 as asian americans, Mena Suvari in Stuck was actually an African American woman......I could literally go on with this whitewashing list for decades.

993,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek",Have you heard her sing?!? It’s not inclusion for inclusion’s sake. Her skin color makes absolutely no difference to the story.

Now, I can believe it in some instances. But seriously where is the overlap between people who like and care about The Little Mermaid and vehemently racist assholes. And if we say there isn't much of an overlap and its just trolls being racist to instigate, then paying them any attention at all is stupid...Unless of course its good for marketing.

And you will also generate shills who, despite the quality of the movie, will feel the need to defend it regardless because if they were to be too critical then it would seem like ""the racists won."" You couldn't come up with better marketing if you tried."

1048,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek","I think Disney relies on nostalgia to get bigger audiences when making these remakes, but I think they’re still made for kids that the rest of the family will still enjoy. Or even if it’s “aimed” at the adults, it’s also made in a way for the kids to enjoy it. The music, the humor, the generally basic story. Kids watch live action shows on Nickelodeon and Disney, so it’s not like live action is a problem. And they probably don’t care about “oh it’s a remake” since there’s a good chance a lot of today’s children haven’t watched or care about a movie that’s more than 3 decades old that they didn’t get to watch in a movie theatre."

The racist jerks in camp 2 should be disliked by everyone, even if they appear to be on the same side regarding how they feel about the casting choice. 

Racists and other discriminatory camps can join lots of sides; we need to be able to separate them from their side to go “those people are terrible even if they’re agreeing” and “those people who are terrible agree on this subject so all people agreeing on that subject are terrible”.

1143,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek",She's actually very tame for her genre. Or for a woman celeb in general she's fairly tame in terms of sexualization of her image. Not to say it isn't there.

1146,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek","Personally I think that as animation moves to hyper-realism, it loses the magic that comes from an animated or artistic world. The real world can be beautiful, but it’s not magical. I felt none of that in the trailer. 

It looks like animation that would have been cutting edge and used in a big budget project in the early 2010’s. Today it feels so lifeless in what’s supposed to be a wonderful film."
1147,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek","I'm sure you're right (I genuinely don't know), but I also don't understand why you'd release footage in that shape for your marketing campaign?"

1151,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek","By that standard, why does a mermaid have hair? It's just a liability underwater. Mermaids should be smooth and fatty like a dolphin."
1152,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek","I'm not upset about the anatomy of them, no, because that really doesn't matter, especially in a movie like this, just the quality of rendering looked bad"
1153,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek",They look kinda flimsy in the original too.
1154,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek","Aladdin was good up until the breakdancing and Jasmine's empowerment song. It didn't fit the rest of the soundtrack and they took out the part where Jasmine almost defeated Jafar for a crappy song. Ironically, best part of the movie was the one everyone was worried about, Will Smith's Genie. Too bad he slapped it all away."
1155,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek","Beauty and the Beast was really well done, Aladdin was pretty good, Mulan ick"
1156,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek",My kids loved the live action Aladdin.

1161,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek",I also enjoyed Aladdin and Beauty and the Beast.

1163,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek","If they’re making Ariel black they should have committed to the bit and made Ursula black too. Would have made sense and maybe served to quell all the folks fussing about the race swap cause it wouldn’t just be one, it’d be everybody. For me, personally, she doesn’t feel like Ariel. I don’t have an issue with the casting, per se, but in my head it’s too much of a change up. Ultimately it doesn’t matter cause I probably won’t see it. I watched Aladdin and was so disappointed I swore off all the live remakes."
1164,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek",That would have been perfect and amazing. Can Melissa McCarthy even sing?

He is all about Raya and the Last Dragon though.  LOL.  But this is obviously just my experience.  He's still young and definitely prefers animated movies now, but maybe he'll be into these remakes when he's a bit older."
1170,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek",You might be right. Maybe the target audience is in the tween age range (the age watching live action shows on Disney and Nickolodean). I have a younger child (6 years old) and he couldn't care less about the live action remakes.  He's definitely only into animated movies and shows right now.
1171,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek","Funny you mention that, I tried watching that last night and feel asleep after a half hour. I'm 36. My kids, 6 and 8, liked it though"
1172,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek",Same. We just tried watching this one tonight and he was not interested.
1173,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek","I mean, I’m sure they are meant for kids, but I don’t disagree with the person you’re responding to entirely. I think that they’re targeting kids AND nostalgic adults — not just kids. And I think the adults care more about them than kids do. 

I literally work with kids and none of them have a live action Disney movie as one of their favorites. They’re into animated movies like Frozen or into animes or into family franchises like Star Wars. The live action Disney movies are too … I’m not sure ‘dour’ is the right word, but they don’t seem to appeal to kids much. Again, I have yet to meet a child who obsesses over one of the live action Disney movies the way they’d obsess over Frozen or Dragonball Z or even some of the original Disney princesses. They’re not necessarily bad movies and kids can watch and enjoy them, but they don’t seem to have much of a long term, strong appeal to kids."
1174,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek","And Star Wars, Star Trek, Marvel, DC, Rick & Morty, the Matrix, Battlestar Gallactica, Stranger Things, Jurassic Park, The Boys, South Park, and the office. But never Disney. That’s baby shit."

1176,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek",Did she get picked to play Ariel?
1177,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek","If she’s playing Ariel, then that’s bad casting. If she’s playing mulan then that’s bad casting. If she’s playing jasmine then that’s bad casting. If she’s playing fucking prince charming then that’s also bad casting. These are just physical facts. Don’t get triggered"
1178,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek","Considering the primary audience for these movies is children, I think it's okay for them to exist. 

Until Disney+, Disney was pretty cagey about giving access to their classic films in home media offerings, and they aren't typically in the business of re-releasing them in theaters. So with that being said, there's not much harm in giving parents and kids the opportunity to see a modern interpretation in the theaters."
1179,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek","So I generally share the same sentiments against capitalism, but how exactly is remaking cartoons into live action movies taking advantage of people???"

1181,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek",The Jungle Book was pretty good
1182,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek",The remakes are needed to maintain like trademark usage or something iirc. Its why you see #3 and 4s in some dead series. It's to check the box that its still in use.

1223,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek",That's the thing. Theyre fairytales. There's something transcendent about them. They’ve been told and retold depending on the culture or country. Cinderella started off as an Egyptian myth. Beauty and the Beast has its roots in the myth of Eros and Psyche. Many cultures have borrowed stories from each other and modified them and put their own stamp on them. So if Beauty and the Beast is a valid retelling of a myth why can't modern retellings also be valid?

1230,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek",Agree with Will Smith. He was good as Genie.

As a kid the only ones I liked from before I was born was Beauty and the Beast and Aladdin, which was like a year before. Any movies older I didn’t really care although I did watch Peter Pan at least a few times, but the older the art forms the less I was engaged with the movies. But I was interested in live remakes - like the Pinocchio movie with the kid from Home Improvement. And the Brandi/Whitney Houston Cinderella. And even the 200-whenever adaption of Peter Pan (which, I don’t think is good, but I was interested in it anyway)."

1242,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek","How is playing Ariel bad casting and a physical fact? The character isn’t real and isn’t ethnically tied to anything. She’s a mythical creature that lives in the ocean. Mulan is a based on a Chinese legend, so a non-Chinese actress would be weird. Aladdin is an Arabian location, so it’d be strange for a black actress to play her. If she was cast as “Prince Charming” and referred to as a male, rather than a specified gender swap where they reworked it to be a “Princess Charming” figure, yeah, that’d be weird.

But the little mermaid is… a mermaid. If anything maybe her skin could be green since she’s a mythical creature. Disney characters often defaulted to white unless they told a story specifically set somewhere of a different culture or was a character of a specific race. Ariel as a character can physically be whatever race/ethnicity for the story. Being non-white doesn’t change her story as a mermaid who becomes human."

They’re repackaging last weeks meal and trying to pass it off as gmo-organic-cage free nonsense when we all know they’re going to butcher it just like the last live actions.

If that doesn’t make sense then what I’m saying, in conclusion, is that they’re taking advantage of childhood favorites by “updating” then when no one wanted or asked for them in the first place- just to make $$ on memories.

There are some that he loves, like Lilo and Stitch, but generally the 2-D animation looks older to him and he's not that interested. He's not a big fan of the original Little Mermaid or any of the ""Disney Renaissance"" era movies, but he loves all the newer movies: Big Hero 6, Encanto, Raya, Frozen, etc."

Maybe he’ll like the old 2-d ones someday, maybe even the live action. To me, The live-action movies and remakes, at least allows today’s kids to have another option of exposure to the stories and kinds of characters many of us appreciated when we were younger. And in general, I feel like some changes in characters, whether simple casting or changes in dialogue and behavior, prevents watching something that could be a shot-for-shot remake. If it’s a fresh new take, I don’t need or care to see a live carbon copy of an old movie. ~$10 or whatever per person just to watch the same thing with nothing new besides no animations seems like a waste of money"

The actress looks beautiful. She even kind of resembles the cartoon Ariel with her large doe eyes. Her voice is AMAZING.

1352,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek","She shouldn’t get hate for a part she got casted to play. 

However there does seem to be a shift in how certain female characters are casted with women of color: Annie, Selina Kyle, Starfire, Tinker Bell, Ariel, Annabeth Chase, Domino, April Jones, Anita Darling. 

I feel that main argument here is if the color of skin truly does not matter, so long the character is portrayed how they need to be…can the same argument be made when Bruce Wayne is played by an Asian actor, or James Bond by a Black Latino  or Goku be Middle Eastern?

If the whole idea that these characters are not real and their real life adaptation can be up to interpretation—then why is there such a fuss? Shouldn’t anyone/everyone feel free to depict them? Or am I still missing something…?"
1353,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek","I'll be honest. The movie looks dumb and I don't care for it. I think it will tank like the live action Lion King and Mulan. I do like the actress and she can sing. I might watch it for laughs.

















I'm sorry, but from the trailer I just know the cgi is going to be horrible. It didn't even look like she was in the water. It looked like some sort of reflection from a green screen or something. 
Also I know they didn't throw that ugly red wig on her head. 



















I think that some movies don't need a live action remake and this is one of them. Not to mention, I would rather see more movies about black princesses than make a white one black. 






















I do think that Ariel should have been left as a white woman. From how I understand, she was a Danish children's tale. I wouldn't want to see a white Tiana from Princess and the Frog. 






















I feel like there are so many African American or even just African stories that Disney could pull from. Hell, make a movie about a black mermaid. 





















I don't think that she should recieve racist comments for it. As a Black woman, I don't condone the fact that she is recieving hate comments. 















Those are my thoughts. Honestly, I see this as Disney trying to appease black people. Instead of making another black princess movie that's not a horror like Princess and the Frog is."

I don’t doubt there are racists saying racist shit about this movie. But from what 99% of the population sees, race has nothing to do with it.

I get that it's just a teaser, but I feel like Disney picked a bad scene to tease with. It's just dark and very static. Her singing is terrific but they couldn't have used her up on the rock with the wave splashing around her like at the end of the song in the animated version?

If people should be complaining about anything, it's Disney's re-hashing of movies they've already made in beautiful 2D animation with generic looking CGI."

In contrast to the little mermaid that does not have a cultural racial significance or lives within a sea that is defined by the populations race and culture as a certain race, it does not matter what race Ariel is

As it is, a 60 second teaser trailer isn't nearly enough to get a full opinion on a full length movie. I have my reservations, but until I see more than just a few seconds of a girl underwater in a dark cave, I'm going to hold back on having an actual opinion."

1505,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek","I literally haven't seen one post criticizint the casting. I hope Disney don't fall into the trap Rings Of Power did. I never seen anyone talk about race apart from your usual right wing YouTubers until the Amazon's marketing team started engaging. Then it started blowing out of proportion until almost every coverage about ROP is about the race. HBO did not engage and now no one cares about the race bent characters on House Of The Dragon while Rings of Power PR is nothing about the show itself but all about being on defense about their choices.

That kind of PR turns off everyone, even those who didn't care in the first place. No wonder HOTD had a more successful rollout because the coverage on it is all about how good it actually is instead of ROP's coverage all about how inclusive it is and how the previous LOTR stars support the changes Amazon made. 

Social Media algorithms are set based on engagements so when they start pushing content on everybody's feed they'd go with what's being engaged the most. Never searched for ROP but all the post leaking on my feed is always about the race of actors playing it while HOTD posts leaking on my feed are all memes made out of the latest episode."
1506,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek","I care nothing about the movie, I care nothing about who portays a Greek mermaid.

1517,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek","I just have no idea how they’re going to make this movie look good. If it’s anything like the live action Lion King, it’s going to try way too hard to look realistic in a creepy way - which is going to be particularly unattractive to the eye in an underwater setting. The original cartoon looked great because of all the vibrant colors and exaggerated humanoid sea creatures. Nemo was able to pull it off because of the art style not trying to be realistic… this doesn’t seem to be the case with TLM. We got a glimpse of Flounder in the trailer and I have a feeling he got so little screen time because he probably looks like a creepy talking fish. I’m thinking bluish-yellowish Big Mouth Billy Bass creepy. Hell, just imagine how bad Sebastian is going to look in live action. This movie was probably a bad idea from an art perspective but who cares if it’s profitable I guess."

1537,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek",I have an issue with the casting.

1543,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek",When I heard my mind went scientific and was like how does a creature that lives on the ocean floor have any dark pigmentation at all she should be white as a ghost as darker pigmentation is not necessary with very little sun then again she also would not have any good eyes. The whole concept of mermaids is weird
1544,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek","She has red locs. Looks fine imo, but this is also an underwater shot so it would probably be brighter in better lighting"

1553,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek","I don't think these remakes *are* meant for kids.  Kids like the newer animated movies.  They are less interested in these live action remakes than the adults who grew up with the originals.  Disney is relying a lot on nostalgia, when they remake these older animated movies."
1554,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek","The Lion King (2019) made 1.6 billion in the box office to become the 8th highest box office of all time. As long as it keeps working, they’ll make these crappy remakes because it’s stupid for them not to. 

The remakes are made for whole families. Butts in seats. It’s a safe, wide appeal with good enough stories and highly funded visuals."
1555,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek",My friend and I argued about a kids movie once and we both paused and said wait… tf are we doing?

1572,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek","It's all a cash grab. Even though people find the remakes dumb or pointless, it also seems people are still going to see them anyway. As they're pumping boat loads of money for Disney.

Aladdin's budget was about $183M. It was critically panned mostly. And people were writing the movie off as bad just off the trailers. It still went on to make about $1B in the box office...same thing with The Lion King. A $250m budget. Not favored highly by critics or the audience. Went on to make $1.66B.

If Disney can make billions off of these lazy live action remakes then they don't have a reason to stop."

1585,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek","I mean, if they make lots of money on adaptations, why stop what works for them? People didn’t *have* to see Aladdin, but they did and that made at least $1 billion worldwide. The jungle book live remake just under $1 billion. The CGI Lion king remake more than $1.5 billion. If people are watching these movies to make around a BILLION dollars worldwide, why would Disney stop? Even if the remakes suck, tens of millions of people are watching these movies anyway, so clearly there’s a market for them."

But worst of all was the Lion King. Ever since the Lion King remake, I have had a passionate distaste for any live action remakes Disney decides to pump out."

1608,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek","Yeah, the live BatB was not good.

It must be really hard to act with only a green screen, though."
1609,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek","Having seen the Broadway version of ""The Little Mermaid"" (I miiiight be a fan girl), I look forward to the live action. Especially if it keeps the Broadway backstory of how Tritan screwed his sister Ursula out of half the kingdom.

That said, maybe Disney should put that effort into something original instead. Since I can't think of any African fairy tales off the top of my head, I assume any movie based on one would be unique."
1610,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek",Princess and the Frog is based on a German fairytale and it adapted just fine.

Maybe I spend too much time around Nintendo communities but it often is just 30 year olds pissed off games aren't hitting the same dopamine levels of nostalgia they had when they were younger going off for hours about how childhood with the Gamecube is better than your childhood with the Switch.

It's like God damn let people enjoy things.

1643,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek",It’s probably because the iconic red hair don’t accommodate the actress.   But this is more brown than red.

Almost every influential real person in history has been whitewashed once before but y'all are gonna bitch about a cartoon? That's next level pathetic.

Edit for all you fucknuts downvoting me: Ben Affleck,  a white man, played Tony Mendez in Argo, Christian Bale and Joel Edgerton played ancient Egyptians in Exodus: Gods and Monsters,  Jennifer Connelly playing an El Salvadorian in A Beautiful Mind, Jim Sturgess and Kate Bosworth in 21 as asian americans, Mena Suvari in Stuck was actually an African American woman......I could literally go on with this whitewashing list for decades.

1655,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek",Have you heard her sing?!? It’s not inclusion for inclusion’s sake. Her skin color makes absolutely no difference to the story.

1662,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek",I think that if they just made her hair red there would be no problem.

The only ones I enjoy are maleficent and I think that’s because it’s not an actual remake but they actually bothered to be creative and I think it’s Genius.

1687,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek",I don’t get this. I honestly think most have been really enjoyable. People are just hung up on nostalgia. It’s not like the original animated movies were masterpieces of storytelling.

1691,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek",Your absolutely correct I like t the fact she was brought on.

And if we say there isn't much of an overlap and its just trolls being racist to instigate, then paying them any attention at all is stupid...Unless of course its good for marketing.

And you will also generate shills who, despite the quality of the movie, will feel the need to defend it regardless because if they were to be too critical then it would seem like ""the racists won."" You couldn't come up with better marketing if you tried."

1710,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek","I think Disney relies on nostalgia to get bigger audiences when making these remakes, but I think they’re still made for kids that the rest of the family will still enjoy. Or even if it’s “aimed” at the adults, it’s also made in a way for the kids to enjoy it. The music, the humor, the generally basic story. Kids watch live action shows on Nickelodeon and Disney, so it’s not like live action is a problem. And they probably don’t care about “oh it’s a remake” since there’s a good chance a lot of today’s children haven’t watched or care about a movie that’s more than 3 decades old that they didn’t get to watch in a movie theatre."

My thought is “if you don’t like it, it’s not for you. Move along”. And why do these people act like these actors wrote and script and cast themselves.

However, she was a white cartoon character based on a white danish fairy tale.  Let’s not act if it wouldn’t be a big deal if the script was flipped."

1795,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek",She is the daughter of Trident. Which is based on Poseidon. A Greek God. The character reflects the people who wrote them.
1796,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek","Yeah; there’s the camp of “Ariel looked like X and they changed it for inclusion sake” and the camp of “black person is the lead in this movie how dare they”. The racist jerks in camp 2 should be disliked by everyone, even if they appear to be on the same side regarding how they feel about the casting choice. 

Racists and other discriminatory camps can join lots of sides; we need to be able to separate them from their side to go “those people are terrible even if they’re agreeing” and “those people who are terrible agree on this subject so all people agreeing on that subject are terrible”. Racist slurs have no place pretty much anywhere at this point in time."

The real world can be beautiful, but it’s not magical. I felt none of that in the trailer. 

It looks like animation that would have been cutting edge and used in a big budget project in the early 2010’s. Today it feels so lifeless in what’s supposed to be a wonderful film."

1813,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek","By that standard, why does a mermaid have hair? It's just a liability underwater. Mermaids should be smooth and fatty like a dolphin."

1815,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek",They look kinda flimsy in the original too.
1816,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek","Aladdin was good up until the breakdancing and Jasmine's empowerment song. It didn't fit the rest of the soundtrack and they took out the part where Jasmine almost defeated Jafar for a crappy song. Ironically, best part of the movie was the one everyone was worried about, Will Smith's Genie. Too bad he slapped it all away."
1817,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek","Beauty and the Beast was really well done, Aladdin was pretty good, Mulan ick"
1818,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek",My kids loved the live action Aladdin.

1825,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek","If they’re making Ariel black they should have committed to the bit and made Ursula black too. Would have made sense and maybe served to quell all the folks fussing about the race swap cause it wouldn’t just be one, it’d be everybody. For me, personally, she doesn’t feel like Ariel. I don’t have an issue with the casting, per se, but in my head it’s too much of a change up. Ultimately it doesn’t matter cause I probably won’t see it. I watched Aladdin and was so disappointed I swore off all the live remakes."

He's still young and definitely prefers animated movies now, but maybe he'll be into these remakes when he's a bit older."
1832,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek",You might be right. Maybe the target audience is in the tween age range (the age watching live action shows on Disney and Nickolodean). I have a younger child (6 years old) and he couldn't care less about the live action remakes.  He's definitely only into animated movies and shows right now.

1835,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek","I mean, I’m sure they are meant for kids, but I don’t disagree with the person you’re responding to entirely. I think that they’re targeting kids AND nostalgic adults — not just kids. And I think the adults care more about them than kids do. 

I literally work with kids and none of them have a live action Disney movie as one of their favorites. They’re into animated movies like Frozen or into animes or into family franchises like Star Wars. The live action Disney movies are too … I’m not sure ‘dour’ is the right word, but they don’t seem to appeal to kids much. Again, I have yet to meet a child who obsesses over one of the live action Disney movies the way they’d obsess over Frozen or Dragonball Z or even some of the original Disney princesses. They’re not necessarily bad movies and kids can watch and enjoy them, but they don’t seem to have much of a long term, strong appeal to kids."
1836,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek","And Star Wars, Star Trek, Marvel, DC, Rick & Morty, the Matrix, Battlestar Gallactica, Stranger Things, Jurassic Park, The Boys, South Park, and the office.

1839,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek","If she’s playing Ariel, then that’s bad casting.

Don’t get triggered"
1840,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek","Considering the primary audience for these movies is children, I think it's okay for them to exist. 

Until Disney+, Disney was pretty cagey about giving access to their classic films in home media offerings, and they aren't typically in the business of re-releasing them in theaters. So with that being said, there's not much harm in giving parents and kids the opportunity to see a modern interpretation in the theaters."
1841,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek","So I generally share the same sentiments against capitalism, but how exactly is remaking cartoons into live action movies taking advantage of people???"

1885,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek",That's the thing. Theyre fairytales. There's something transcendent about them. They’ve been told and retold depending on the culture or country. Cinderella started off as an Egyptian myth. Beauty and the Beast has its roots in the myth of Eros and Psyche. Many cultures have borrowed stories from each other and modified them and put their own stamp on them. So if Beauty and the Beast is a valid retelling of a myth why can't modern retellings also be valid?

1892,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek",Agree with Will Smith. He was good as Genie.

As a kid the only ones I liked from before I was born was Beauty and the Beast and Aladdin, which was like a year before. Any movies older I didn’t really care although I did watch Peter Pan at least a few times, but the older the art forms the less I was engaged with the movies. But I was interested in live remakes - like the Pinocchio movie with the kid from Home Improvement. And the Brandi/Whitney Houston Cinderella. And even the 200-whenever adaption of Peter Pan (which, I don’t think is good, but I was interested in it anyway)."

1904,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek","How is playing Ariel bad casting and a physical fact? The character isn’t real and isn’t ethnically tied to anything. She’s a mythical creature that lives in the ocean. Mulan is a based on a Chinese legend, so a non-Chinese actress would be weird. Aladdin is an Arabian location, so it’d be strange for a black actress to play her. If she was cast as “Prince Charming” and referred to as a male, rather than a specified gender swap where they reworked it to be a “Princess Charming” figure, yeah, that’d be weird.

But the little mermaid is… a mermaid. If anything maybe her skin could be green since she’s a mythical creature. Disney characters often defaulted to white unless they told a story specifically set somewhere of a different culture or was a character of a specific race. Ariel as a character can physically be whatever race/ethnicity for the story. Being non-white doesn’t change her story as a mermaid who becomes human."

1908,"Fans Defend Halle Bailey’s 'The Little Mermaid' After The Actress Receives Offensive, Racist Slurs Following Movie’s Official Sneak Peek","It’s taking advantage of the nostalgia built around these characters. Films like Aladdin, Lion King, Beauty and the Beast, etc. all have fan bases.

They’re repackaging last weeks meal and trying to pass it off as gmo-organic-cage free nonsense when we all know they’re going to butcher it just like the last live actions.

If that doesn’t make sense then what I’m saying, in conclusion, is that they’re taking advantage of childhood favorites by “updating” then when no one wanted or asked for them in the first place- just to make $$ on memories.

Disney literally took the little mermaid and made her black. I just want to see more original stories from Disney when it comes to black people. 

















Sure a kid you love just seeing someone who looks at you. I love to see it. But as you get older, you start to notice little stuff.  For instance, just recently making more diverse Disney princess movies that are original. 


















And what about indengenious representation. Pocahontas ain't cutting it. Peter Pan is horribly prejeduice against Native Americans.

There are some that he loves, like Lilo and Stitch, but generally the 2-D animation looks older to him and he's not that interested.

To me, The live-action movies and remakes, at least allows today’s kids to have another option of exposure to the stories and kinds of characters many of us appreciated when we were younger. And in general, I feel like some changes in characters, whether simple casting or changes in dialogue and behavior, prevents watching something that could be a shot-for-shot remake. If it’s a fresh new take, I don’t need or care to see a live carbon copy of an old movie. ~$10 or whatever per person just to watch the same thing with nothing new besides no animations seems like a waste of money"
