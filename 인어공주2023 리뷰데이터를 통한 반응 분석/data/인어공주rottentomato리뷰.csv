Doris Hecker,5,A definite must see Movie !!! Alot of different emotions which had a Happy Ending !!  :)
JARPER,5,Less songs and more excitement. The new version was the best version of The Little Mermaid.
tara h,5,"It was soooo good,  visual effects were amazing,  story was great,  acting and singing was amazing!"
Tracey,5,The movie was excellent
witallsmiles,5,It was just like the animated movie
Ronnalyn S,5,This movie was really good.  I'm glad there were slight changes but didn't stray too far from the Disney version.  I've already seen it twice
Ty,2,"It was a cute movie, but the script felt forced, like they were trying to hard to bring in aspects from the original animated film. Overall very cute movie, just was not very well put together, felt like it was patched up into a bunch of random scenes."
Riley,5,best live action remake by far
Erika,3,They could of done a better job at making Ariel look like Ariel. Her hair was not even close to being red which is a big part of her costume and just makes the character. Most of the storyline was on point.
Lynn,5,"It was a delightful, beautiful movie. The music, the actors the visual effects were all amazing. I highly recommend it."
Oliwia,5,Loved that Disney kept all the original scenes and added some really good extras !
Satyendra,3,"Overall I can't say it says good as the original, however it respects it and is clearly made with love and affection for it. So I would say it's well worth your time!"
Lisa Marie,5,Blew our expectations out of the water! Ha ha!
Monica,5,The recliner seats were very comfy!
Yesi,1,Im sorry but it was horrible.
Katie,5,"It was magical! 10/10...I loved everything about this movie...the casting, the singing, the whole thing took me right back to my childhood."
TreeO,5,"I didnt care for Prince Erics solo song.  Other than that, the movie was fantastic."
Mia J,5,Beautifully done!!!!

Yvonne,5,Cinematography was Fabulous- 3D was Fabulous - music was Fabulous! Loved it!
Jodi,5,The movie was visually stunning. Loved seeing the old animated movie come to life. Loved all of the actors. Lots of action and reminded be a bit of Pirates of the Caribbean. A fun summer movie
Donald,5,Movie was real good.   Very good story line
Jennifer M H,5,"Loved the movie 
True to storyline 
Awesome music"
Nehemiah L,5,TheLittleMermaid was EXCELLENT and so culturally diverse. Loved it! Definitely worth the 34 year wait.
Ladee S.,5,"Loved this rendition of my favorite Disney Princess movie! Literal tears, Halle was phenomenal!"
Scarlett,3,"Ariel can sing.  The movie reminds me in cartoon.  Great job!  However,  I expected the girl with red hair, but there's no such girl with natural red hair like the cartoon."
Stephen,5,Loved everything about it!
craig,4,"This version was true to the original, I appreciated the new songs that were added, they were good and still in the style of the original soundtrack. The final scene was very intense and well done. CGI characters were not quite as lovable and comical as animated ones. We enjoyed the movie very much"
Candy,5,Loved it’s from beginning to end!
Deborah M,5,"Absolutely love, the story and animation have been close to my heart and to see it live send me into almost happy tears. A wonderful movie"
Kenyette,4,the 3d was a little blurry
Vanessa Graham,5,The cast was amazing and Lin Manuel is a pure genius with song writing. And Halle is Ariel!
will,5,"Well done story, beautiful CGI and acting, incredible perfomance by Halle Bailey! The Crab needs his movie clearly."
Coty,5,Why didn’t they hire someone with the accent for Sebastian? Also Awkwafina isn’t that good for her to be booking all these roles. Her voice is just grating.
Cortes,5,"Being a father who has had his child withheld from him, knowing with all your power yet feeling completely powerless, willing to give up anything just to make them feel safe. And the pain in knowing i will one day have to let my baby go It definitely got to me."
Erika W,5,It was a little tear jerker at the end.
DS,3,It was good but I wish it was more like the original version.
Alyah,5,Great movie. I love the change to the ending.
zabrielle,5,Very culturally diverse great graphics beautifully made. It captured my ninth month old daughters attention a great deal.
Natalie D.,5,"Halle Bailey's singing and acting was spectacular, loved the new songs written by Lin-Manuel Miranda. And, the Aator who played Prince Eric had the voice of a Angel. Loved the storyline and the costumes. The costume designer will definitely win several awards this year. I have already seen it 2 times (once in 3D). I plan on seeing it  again and again before it leaves the theaters. Love this Movie!!!"
Sha,4,One of the best movies everrrrre
john,4,cute movie with amazing visual effects
Charlotte Skiba,4,We were blown away! We absolutely enjoyed  all your services..thank you
Kathe,4,Overall loved the movie but the Ursela interactions were a bit scary for young kids. The little girl next to us put her blanket over her head!
Sandi S,5,The Little Mermaid was Fabulous! The movie just drew you into the show and what was happening to the Mermaid! Great Movie!
Tammy,5,Loved it!  It was perfectly made and depicted the original to a T!

deanladi U,3,Best part was Javier Bardem!! Didnt need all the extra songs by Eric. Way too long!!
Steffy,5,This movie is AMAZING!!! Brought me right back to my childhood!! Halle was INCREDIBLE and executed her role as Arielle PERFECTLY!!! Representation matters!!! Definitely a must see!!
LadySparkle,0,"Not what I was expecting, killed my fav childhood cartoon."
Tania F,5,I loved this movie. Definitely brought up memories of me being a child watching this movie with my parents. I  loved to see the diversity in all the characters presented in the movie. Amazing
Fredrick,5,Halle was born for this role. She absolutely killed it. The movie stuck true to the original story but provided a fresh and modern take. Melissa as Ursula was also more than I could’ve asked for! Job well done!
Google,5,Great remake Halle first time on the big screen did not upset!!
Karen,5,"really liked the special effects and the new song by scuttle, Ursula death was a little scary for young children"
Paola,5,My daughters love the move. Me either I cry like a baby remembering when I was young watching the mermaid
Lina L,3,"This new incarnation of  Disney favorite was beautifully made. The animations were colorful and vivid, although I could see why some could be put off by the realistic animal depictions. Flounder doesn't look as cute and childish here, but the spirit of the story is still there. Hailey Baley has an amazing voice and did justice to the lyrics and songs of the past. Prince Eric was perfectly cast, as he looked like someone just used AI to humanize the cartoon version. 
Melissa McCarthy rocked as Ursula.
Great experience at the theater and only adds a different and rich dimension to the classic cartoon version."
TERRY,5,Loved the movie from being and especially the end. Well made Disney

Kelondra,5,I loved the entire movie start to finish! The acting was amazing the music was wonderful it was just an overall great movie
Amairani,4,"It was sooo cute the CGI was crazy cool and the new songs Ariel sang were beautiful, I honestly prefer this new movie than the original."
Francine M. C,5,Wonderful movie.  I thoroughly enjoyed!!
Daynet,5,"Its a wonderful movie, makes me cry, at the end with her father scene,, very pretty and well performance and special effects."
Cheryl,5,Great beautifully done
LUNAR,5,"The movie was done well. Halle Bailey did phenomenal for her first acting gig and her voice is undeniable. The animation was pretty cool, it was an updated version of our classic Little Mermaid and they did the job. It was very nostalgic and also Melissa McCarthy is amazing as always. It did slightly have me at the edge of my seat when the action started to happen and my 5yr old little boy said he enjoyed the movie so plus plus from us!! CONGRATULATIONS HALLE!!!!!!"
Porsha,4,The movie was giving me original lion king vibes with the color and animation. I lovedit a lot!!!

Dana,5,I loved the diversity of the characters and how closely it matched the original movie.
David,4,"Richly colored, good storyline generally, nice entertainment for a few hours.  Movie was a bit long, though!"
Palmerin,2,Love Disney movies but the singing was subpar
Bryan,5,I loved it it was funny special effects were awesome very beautiful colors all throughout the movie kept you watching the screen highly recommend watching it

Michael,5,took my grandmother to see it since she always put the original on for me as a kid and it was just a great time
Yaryna,5,"It was a beautiful movie, I was thoroughly engaged emotionally. I am glad new generations will grow up with this film."
Nancy,5,Omg i loved everything about this movie it was fabulous.
Nora,5,Second time watching the little mermaid. This time was in 3D and i loved it even more than the first time! I thought i’d bought 4DX tickets but I guess not. I’ll have to watch it again in 4DX. Definitely a must see!
Jessica,5,Excellent movie. I was moved by Halle Bailey's performance. She was the perfect choice. All of the cast did a wonderful job.
Joann G,5,"Loved it. Wasn’t sure how it would compare to the original, but it was (date I say) better. Loved all the additions."
Nichole,3,"The under the sea song was botched from the original. They didnt improve on it like they have in other live remakes and instead they took away the amazing full choir feel of it. Halle was great as little mermaid and I loved that some things were clarified in the live version like the sirens voice and how Ariels friends are helping her to get true loves kiss etc. But the climax was ruined for me when Ariel had to be the one to kill the sea witch instead of Eric in the original. To me this would have tied it all together to show Triton that not all humans are bad and that they worked together. Overal I felt the movie was meh and could have really blown some things out of the water but as usual per lately, they are missing the mark."
Kimberly,5,Loved it!!  Action packed and just a great movie.
M.Elena,5,My daughters and I enjoyed every minute of this movie
Camille M,5,Excellent performance by Halley Bailey
Darrius,4,The little mermaid captured all the emotions of the original and brought them to real life. Halle Bailey not only had the singer chops but the actress chops. She gave real life Disney princess and made the move spectacular.
Tnb,1,The story was too drawn out and the characters were completely different from the original. Would not recommend at all. Its a movie you can watch at home when it releases.
Disney Fan,5,"Very sweet telling of an old Disney movie. Loved Halle Bailey! It also had a Bridgerton feel - several supporting actors were familiar. All in all, great movie for the whole family."
Kimberly,5,this movie was very entertaining for children and adults worth every penny I spent on my family this weekend.
MeMe,5,Great movie!! Must see! I think it was beautifully adapted to live action!
Aolani,5,such an awesome movie!!
Kathrin,1,"they did put effort to make the movie, but my daughter lost interest in the first 15 mins. we laughed in some parts but over all, nothing special. So sorry for the actress but I prefer my original red hair beautiful Ariel"
semaj r,5,"Disney did an excellent job remaking this movie. 
My whole family enjoyed it. Disney modernized it without going post pandemic crazy."
Ketih E,5,One of the best remakes Disney has done! Very entertaining and shed a tear at the end 🥲My daughter and I enjoyed it!

Stephanie G,5,liked the diversity of the characters
priscilla,5,I loved it so much it was so beautiful though the lighting was a bit too dark at times the movie was still amazing! I can’t wait to watch it again!!!!! Love Halle and Jonah’s performance and I’m hoping for a sequel!!! 💙
Chesley,3,"It was good. Loved the music, & that Prince Eric had a song.  This version has Ariel calling King Triton ""father"" instead of ""daddy"" & they omitted the line ""But daddy, I love him!"", which is a bummer.  Also when daddy destroys her treasure trove, instead of clutching Prince Eric's face from the statue, she clutches his hand.  I thought they could have stayed truer to the wedding, as well. But I liked it, & my grand babies liked it!"
Dan,5,Much much better than the critics would have you believe. Everyone gave a fantastic performance. 5/5.
Mark,5,"Outstanding acting, and singing.
Special affects were amazing"

Cameron,4,I loved the movie 😍
Jen,4,"Followed the original movie, and the animation was amazing! Loved it!"
Angela,3,I didnt like how the order of things was switched up. I didnt like how Eric didnt seem like a prince and they changed so many characters. I didnt like the changes of songs and the added rap song. I did however enjoy Ursula and thought Melissa McCarthy was amazing. There were a few added scenes that were funny that I enjoyed. Overall it was okay but definitely wasnt my favorite Disney remake.
Justin,1,Row E seat 17 doesn’t recline. The movie was amazing but we paid for a recliner seat and it doesn’t work
Gwen,5,It was very cool to see the real people interacting with the computer generated characters.
Kim K,5,The lessons throughout the movie and Halles raw talent.
AC,5,"The Little Mermaid 3-d animation was beautiful.  The movement of sea life during Under the Sea was beautiful.  You could see the dedication and collaboration with the Alvin Ailey Dance Troupe. The signing was wonderful. Ursula was the ultimate villain. Kiss the Girl was true to the original. Great vision, great production."
Barrett,5,Halle Bailey was superb and has a wonderful voice. Realign an animation mix was excellent. Brought a tear just like the original movie.
Tiffany Tierra,5,Awesome awesome. Halle we love you.
rachael,5,This movie was excellent! Quality animation and chole is a star! Everyone did a great job keeping it familiar but brought something new to it. Great watch
Nick M,5,I loved it! Run to see it!

Iris B,5,This adaption of the Animated version of  “The Little Mermaid was absolutely the best live action adaption Disney has done in a long while.

Cant wait to buy it when it comes out!"

Nancy F,5,"A tremendously moving and heartfelt movie showing sentiment, romance, a little bit of danger and meaningful feelings and intermixed with fantasy elements.  Walt Disney would be incredibly proud on his 100th anniversary for this movie to become live action even though the cartoon version was very good.  The music, singing, songwriting and songs were so wonderful and Im glad that they were preserved from the original cartoon release version."

Doug L,5,As good as the original classic
Jacqueline,5,"Prepare to be swept away on a breathtaking journey beneath the waves as Disney's latest cinematic gem, The Little Mermaid, captivates audiences with its timeless charm and visually stunning cinematography. This enchanting adaptation of the beloved classic tale breathes new life into the depths of our imagination, reminding us of the magic that lies within us all.

One cannot help but marvel at the impeccable cinematography that transports viewers to an underwater wonderland. From the vivid coral reefs to the ethereal mermaid kingdom, every scene is crafted with such meticulous attention to detail that it feels like a living, breathing work of art. The vibrant colors, the fluid movements of the characters, and the awe-inspiring visual effects make it an absolute delight for the eyes. Director Rob Marshall's vision is brought to life with such finesse that it is impossible not to be completely immersed in this fantastical world.
But beyond its stunning visuals, The Little Mermaid delivers a powerful message that resonates deeply in today's society. It dares to challenge the prejudices that persist in our world, reminding us of the importance of acceptance, inclusivity, and celebrating our differences. The casting of Halle Bailey, a phenomenally talented young African-American actress, in the role of Ariel is a bold and progressive move by Disney. Bailey's portrayal of the iconic mermaid is filled with grace, strength, and undeniable talent, shattering stereotypes and proving that diversity can only enrich the storytelling experience.
It is disheartening to see some individuals succumb to prejudice and racism, expressing their displeasure at a beautifully diverse cast. However, it is important to acknowledge that this new rendition of The Little Mermaid is a reflection of the world we live in, celebrating the diversity that exists in our society. Rather than dwelling on such negativity, let us applaud the film for its willingness to break barriers, inspire young minds, and foster a sense of unity among its viewers.
The music in The Little Mermaid is another standout aspect that deserves praise. The timeless melodies that have become synonymous with the original animated film are reimagined and beautifully reinvigorated. The talented cast, led by Bailey, delivers powerful vocal performances that breathe new life into these beloved songs. It is an auditory treat that will have you singing along and humming the tunes long after you leave the theater.
Ultimately, The Little Mermaid is a cinematic triumph that seamlessly weaves together stunning visuals, a diverse and talented cast, and a poignant message of acceptance. It reminds us that our differences should be celebrated, not feared. This film has the power to ignite conversations, inspire change, and leave a lasting impact on audiences of all ages.
Let us embrace the magic and wonder of The Little Mermaid, and let its powerful message serve as a reminder that love knows no boundaries and that our world is at its best when we stand united, celebrating our diversity."
Jennifer S,5,"A heart-warming, family-friendly musical that celebrates diversity, forgiveness, and understanding. Some scary moments are not for small children."
Charmaine,5,It was excellent! Very realistic. There were a couple of changes from the cation version. But it really lived up the the hype. Chloe’s singing was the highlight. That lady has some pipes on her.

Christina H,4,"The animation, music and story were all amazing."
SARA,5,"Keeps a lot from the original animated film, but also expands on some things and changes it up just enough to keep it exciting and from being an exact copy of the original film. Very fun movie, great music, and beautiful visuals. Great for fans who grew up with the Little Mermaid and young kids just being exposed to Ariel."

No Name,5,It was a really great movie. The music and the looks were really well done.
Alison,5,"I absolutely loved it and the bar was high for me since I saw the animated version in theaters when I was five. Halle was incredible as Ariel, and Eric, Scuttle, and Flounder were all standouts I did not see coming.  Again, I am just completely blown away by Halle. She was perfection."

Jordan,4,"This movie is stunning visually and the cast is brilliant. I watched it with my 6-year-old the first time and it did not go well due to the movie length. However, went and saw it a second time just by myself and it was incredible! Cannot wait to watch again."

Stephanie G,5,"I was impressed by the adaptation of this film to 3D which reminded me of the Avatar release I saw last year. The cast was diverse, it featured a couple of new songs, and we were thoroughly entertained throughout the movie. A little boy even ran up to the screen to pet the dog because he thought it was in the same theater! My 9-year old was scared at the end during the Ursula fight scene but because it was SO realistic. Overall this movie was spectacular!"
Lorraine,5,Heartwarming love between father and daughter. Love at first sight was sweet. We loved it
Ruth K,3,"Musical lots of singing. Very long but needed to be. Don’t know why they mentioned Erik’s questionable family ties but didn’t expand on it, makes more sense to take that out. Overall very good"
Ariel B4 Ariel was cool,4,"Very cute remake. Close to the original with a few surprises scattered about and some new musical numbers. My kids enjoyed it and sat through the whole movie. The characters were given refreshing and modern updates from what we saw in the 90s while keeping close to the classic movie we all loved. I do wish the main character, Ariel, made more of an effort to communicate despite being unable to speak (as she did in the original cartoon movie). It would have made the story more believable. Still, bravo to Lin Manuel Miranda for bringing this fairytale back to new life. Well done."
Katreena,5,loved this classic film reimagined
Tatyana,5,The movie was beautiful Halles voice literally shook my soul
Michelle R,5,Very cute movie. I really enjoy it. Everyone had amazing vocals and it kept me entertained. I would suggest watching this movie with an open mind and to not compare it to the original. Overall highly recommend to watch. Its a definitely a feel good movie.

Britney Talbert,5,I mean absolutely breath taking! I'm in complete bliss! Halle just set the bar for african american girls all over the world! NEVER STOP DREAMING!

I disliked the over use of CGI and that there were not many familiar actors/actresses."

Vicki,5,Loved the 3-D feature.
Leanna,5,Absolutely amazing. This young lady not only has an outstanding set of pipes but she is also a great actress. The story followed the same plot as the animated original and any deviations only enhanced it further. I was not disappointed.

Sue S.,5,"Loved the action, music and storyline.  Loved the characters and the special effects.  Would have liked the Prince Erik to have been the one to take out Ursula, like in the animated version."
Amy,1,"Horrible. Music was thin, flat, poorly arranged, lacking up-best tempo and minimal harmonies. Couldnt stay past Ursula."
Christina P,5,Everyone in the theater with me were clapping and cheering at the end of the movie. I am so glad that they did not leave out any of the classical parts of the original little mermaid. They did the story/movie justice. Well done!! Excellent!

Sebastian 
Story line, dad missing daughter"
Farrah,4,I loved it! It has great content

ToniR,5,I liked and enjoyed everything.
Ramonia,5,Amazing and full of color!
Erica R,4,I love Halle. I love TLM... 100% best live-action I've seen for Disney (princess wise)! Halle Bailey has an aura unlike any other. The other characters played their roles well. Vanessa's actress was amazing for the minutes she played embodied Ursula to a 'T'. I hope there will be a part 2 although that would be hard to make  if you've seen TLM series!
Rae,5,"Great movie , the kids and husband loved it."
Dionte,5,AMAZING! Loved Halle Bailey and Melissa McCarthy’s performance. This might be the best live action remake of a Disney classic I’ve seen yet!

Sally,5,"It was very entertaining.  I enjoyed Melissa McCarthy as Ursula, and king Triton was pretty cool."
Jacob,1,"""Les Poisson"" did not make it into the movie. Neither did Ursula bemoaning the fate of her ""little poopsies."""
Gabby K,5,It was so great! Better then the OG
Sylvia,5,I like where King Triton says its for your own good and then destroys Ariels Eric statue and also where Eric snatches Ursulas crown with his bare hand and also where Ariel makes a ship pierces Ursula and she dies and where Scuttle sings the Scuttle Butt and then Sebastian is like lets go and then Ariel covers them and then Sebastian says Scuttle youre to close.
Marcos,5,Halle Bailey’s voice is gorgeous! Overall I liked this new version. Not crazy about Ursula’s make up. Animations were really nice and Under the Sea and Kiss The Girl continue to be iconic!
Rhonda,5,The music was awesome
Cristina 2,5,The best movie ever 🤩🤩🤩
Lenora,5,"I absolutely loved everything about The Little Mermaid!  Halle Bailey brought Ariel to life in a way that was totally fascinating! Halle, that young lady gave an outstanding believable performance! The voice of Sebastian had me hook line and sinker and OMG Melissa McCarthy played a scary Ursula so well she was truly believable.  Bottom line am going to go see it again and in my opinion every single character was beautifully portrayed!"

Patricia J,5,It was visually pleasing and enjoyable.  I took my young Granddaughter.

Joseph,4,Liked the songs. Flounder did not look like flounder
Google,5,Excellent!! Will see again!
Chastity,2,It was good but they added unnecessary songs.
Vanessa D,5,"I usually worry the live actions will dim the nostalgia I feel when watching movies I grew up with, the casting in this movie was immaculate and Halle Bailey is beyond amazing as a vocalist, and her acting, age and soft/gentleness is perfect for Disney movies. I’m not too familiar with her music aside from this project but I was moved and emotional by her vocal performances. I think it’s beautiful at how well executed and diverse this project was. It was modern and refreshing but not overly ambitious to change what was already a great movie. Job well done Disney."
My My,4,I liked that they had mermaids of all races shown in the movie. I thought party under the sea with all the sea creatures was cute.
A. H.,5,Absolutely amazing! Going to see it again!
Meghan,5,"The live version of The Little Mermaid was AWESOME. Halle Bailey has a phenomenal voice and Melissa McCarthy was a great choice for Ursula. Eric’s actor was… Eric. Yeah. 

Anyone that can pull off the song, Part of Your World, with that much emotion is PERFECT for that part. ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ 

HOWEVER, I don’t like the movie Jaws, so if you don’t like it either, I highly recommend skipping that scene. 🤣"

Google,5,Amazing and all the singing was on point I love Lil mermaid and the cultural aspect of it everyone is the same and equal
Jenny,3,It was well acted & Ursula was very fun & funny. Ariel & Eric did a great job. It was an almost exact copy of the animated one from my youth with was nice & familiar but it also would have been nice to see some artistic license taken. The volume level was intense and my 9 year old had her fingers in her ears most of the time & at one point wanted to leave because of it.
Maria,5,We loved it my daughter was so excited when I told her were seeing the new little mermaid definitely 10 out of 10 highly recommend

Kamiah,5,"Thank you so much for everyone on the team that created this movie for all of us. The Little Mermaid is a classic, and I’m sure most were worried that a live action would ruin the original. It was very close to the original and it was so beautiful. The added songs were very nice as well! Thank you from a young, inner child. 🖤"

Greg,5,Amazing Movie….. if you disliked it or the Halley version of Ariel you’re just a hater…. Period…..
Sabrina,1,I didnt like that the show made my 3 and 5 yr grandsons scared. Its too advance for little ones. Just felt like the witch was yo evil looking and just over the top. I honestly wouldnt even give 1 star.

Samantha,5,"Loved it!!! Often the remakes of such classic movies are a let down, but not with The Little Mermaid. It stayed true to the original but realistic cast members, and a few new songs. I really enjoyed it and even got a little emotional at the end. A must see for all classic Disney princess fans for a fresh new take on a beautiful story."

Dolores,5,Surpassed my expectations. Melissa McCarthy was absolutely amazing.  Halle Bailey was very convincing as Ariel.
Wendy,5,Seriously unlike any movie I've ever seen. Must see in 3D to get to full effects. It was different enough to be a totally different movie from the original but also honored the beloved classic.
Beth,5,"Loved it , it could have done without rapping from scuttle but loved it!!!!!"

David,5,Great remake. Halle did this right.
Larry,4,"Love it, and the message of not taking your childs voice for granted. Solid cast and good visuals."
Kimberly,5,Very cute movie for all ages!!
carol,5,"Beautiful story, music was great!"
antonio,2,"there were so many things they added that were needed, eric had a song that wasnt good, under the sea song just wasnt the same, where was the chef and Sebastin scene, Aquafina could have been funnier, some scenes could have been a little more dramatic but I will say Melissa Mccarthy stole the movie she was an amazing ursala!!!!"
Amanda,5,Went to see it twice!
katrenia,5,Awesome movie! I loved every bit of it!
Lisa,4,Great singing. Melissa McCarthy as Ursula was great! Special effects were very good. Parts of it might be a bit scary for young children. Probably better for ages 10 and up! Loved it!
Anthony S,4,It was a great remake of a classic Disney movie with a little twist.
Jesselyn,5,How it was very similar to the old classic I grew up watching but at the same time had a twist and nice spin.
Veronica,5,Great movie. Halle was so perfect for this role! All of the actors and actresses were phenomenal!

Sameerah,5,It was very diverse I loved that with the remake
Michelle,5,i really enjoyed it. The color of the world under the sea was amazing.
Sydni,5,"Halle Bailey was easily the standout in this film! Nobody else could of played her role. There were some moments I even cried a little bit! The whole cast was amazing, and definitely had some funny moments, especially from Scuttle, played by Awkwafina. Overall, the film was a delightful experience. My friend and I saw it in 3D which made it even more enjoyable to watch! 5/5 stars!"
Robert,5,"Gret colors, graphics and music"

Tristen,5,Enjoyed this live action remake!!! Was a little long and my 4 year was bored at times but I absolutely loved it!!
Paula,2,great acting but same movie !! which made this boring as heck !!
DS,3,Halle Berry & Melissa McCarthy are worth it. Lin Manuel Mirandas songs are totally out of place though. Just weird mismatched style. Using the new songs from the Broadway production would have made more sense.

megs,5,"I’m an avid fan of the original but this blew me away & I’m very picky. They all did amazing, I love they made it modern & fave Prince Eric a background. Halle was just perfect & the instant she sang I got goosebumps"
Juan,5,OMG I loved the movie. I can’t wait to buy it so I can see it again.
Megan,5,The Little Mermaid was my favorite childhood movie.  I didn’t expect to love the remake as much as I did.  Halle Bailey was the perfect Ariel.  Amazing graphics and fun characters.  Disney nailed this remake in my opinion
karen a,1,This was one of the worst 3D effect movies I have ever seen. Do not spend the extra $$ on 3D.  And wait for it on Netflix or other.  😔the. Singing. And casting was good!!
LaToya,5,I had one person that wasn’t able to come and I couldn’t get a refund at the movies .   The movie was amazing
Nadia,5,"This movie was a breath of fresh air for the likes of both children and adults. The visuals, acting, and of course the iconic songs made my day! Such a joy to see, this is a feel good movie. Glad to see that mostly everyone enjoyed it as much as I did."
Eric,5,A new version of a classic treasure. All the magic brought back and expanded upon. I’ve seen it twice now.
Lorie M,4,"I enjoyed it thoroughly,but my granddaughter didn't. She got scared of Ursula!"
Emily D,5,"Really enjoyed this version of Little Mermaid. Halle Bailey has a beautiful voice. I liked the new songs and I liked the overall take on each of the characters-Ariel, Ursula, Eric, Sebastian, Flounder, Scuttle, etc. They all did a great job!"
Bianca,5,beautiful movie!!!!!

Diana,5,Great visuals!! Awesome music updates!  An absolutely beautiful film.  I love the representation and actors choice.  Well done Disney!
Mel,5,I loved watching it in 3D and it being with humans
Monica S,5,I was hoping to see the chef and Sebastian part and when Ariel sat at the dinner table using the fork as a comb and pipe as an instrument. Also I didn’t like the fact Prince Eric wasn’t the one to kill Ursula.
Renee5,1,Too long !! It dragged
Lisa,5,"Love everything about this movie. All the colors beautiful song reminds me of the cartoon version, some parts of the movie was new as parts of the first little mermaid didn't made it in the movie...even it has its own version it didn't take away too much of the old version loved Hailey Bailey she did very well that girl can sing thumbs up to her and the cast all did a great job."
Marie C,5,Excellent 🫶🏼🔥🔥my Baby girl loved it 😍😘😜
Jonathan,5,"The movie was just so gorgeous, they thought of everything. Vanessa looked absolutely stunning and as so did Ariel. 🧜🏽‍♀️"
R,1,"It was ok.  I prefer the original.  :) this version lacked that spark that the live action beauty and beast or Aladdin had. 
Ariel did a good job. Prince Eric could not act to save his life IMO.  He was my least fav.  And his solo song was just forced. the CGI was a bit special/choppy especially towards the end.  Scuttle is a girl which was interesting. Prince Eric and Ariel have 6 pack abs which is unnecessary."
PattiK,5,The movie was very good but we were so distracted from the heat it was hard to enjoy. The A/C went out before the movie started and did not come back on till the last 15 minutes.
Kosha,5,IT WAS AMAZING. VERY NOSTALGIA FOR ME

First L,5,Absolutely beautiful phenomenal work. I didn’t think it would be this good and I’m glad it was.
Dianne,4,Visually beautiful.  True to the original film.  Haily Bailey was wonderful and what a voice. Melissa McCarthy was so great Ursula.

Aries,4,We liked the crab and the mermaid and her daddy
Jake O,2,"Acting was awful, the new songs they added were REALLY bad, and I think they changed way too much from the original. The songs from the original movie were really good. That was my only redeeming factor"
Susan C,5,"The special effects were out of this world. Better than Avatar in my opinion. The music and singing was wonderful. Even though I knew the whole story, this more than kept my attention. I liked it much better than the cartoon, and I really liked the cartoon. I really enjoyed the interracial cast. The costumes were fabulous and the choreography was wonderful. Thumbs up! Five stars!"
MOSHY,5,I JUST LOVE HALLE🤍🤍 SHE DID GREAT!!!!!
cheree s,5,Loved every minute of it.
Mrs. Chisum,5,"Great movie! I love the vibrant colors. I enjoyed how realistic everything was, and everyone looked.  The only negative was Sebastián was a crab and not a lobster like the original movie, and Flounder didn't look like a flounder fish."
Mark,1,"Acting was not good, graphics were mediocre.  Worst villain performance Ive ever seen.  Save your money, wait for streaming"
Kasandra,4,Such a wonderful movie!
Colleen G,5,I loved this movie so much. I grew up watching the Little Mermaid when I was little. If you get the chance to go see this movie DO IT!!! The cast was AMAZING!!!
Maddox,4,Halle Berry did a great job!  The movie was aesthetically appealing!  I would highly recommend it!
Tony,5,Great movie! Good story line and singing
Elizabeth,3,Im a huge Disney fan and the seagull character was off they didnt sing all the songs if you going to make it into a live action make sure you make it as close if not identical to the original. Flounder was a skinny little fish. It was subpar at most. Do better
Maisie,5,Was so similar to the original! Loved it so much
Kee,5,Definitely a must see!! Halle did an amazing job!!
Aleh,1,"It was ok, some scenes were not good"

Im a softie at heart, so it was crying time at the last, but happiness at the ending."

Linda D J,5,I liked best that it was multicultural.
Caitlin,5,it was an amazing movie I loved every minute of it
Randel,5,Everything about the new movie was fantastic
Lillie,5,I loved everything about the show! Halle did a great job!

Erica,5,Halle was everything
montelongor2002,5,Loved the movie beautiful effects and right on
Jarad,5,"Loved all the vibrant colors. Took my daughter on a daddy-daughter date, and it was perfect! Halle sang her butt off, and made the whole movie!

Bernice,5,"took my grandkid and hey loved the movie, self serve for their popcorn and soda the experience was great."
Jiminti,5,The mix of animation and humans was terrific. Great story!
Chelsea,3,"The movie had great special effects and was great in IMAX. The music was fun and nostalgic, but the story line was exactly the same as the original which isn't wrong, but it made for a more boring experience. The crab was fun and lively, but they made flounder so sad and lifeless. I could have let this one go to disney plus and would have been fine."
Christine and T,5,"Loved, loved, loved it"
Teresa F,5,My favorite part when the pelican was rapping that was to cute.
Julia,5,Loved the mixture of animation.  Halle Bailey was wonderful in the role of the little mermaid.  Loved that it was in tune to the original movie!
Christina R,5,"Amazing animations and visual effects! The music was GREAT! And in my eyes, the cast was perfect!"
Jayne W,3,"Loved most of it! However, there is 1 thing that I didn't care for, which is Skuttles being underwater for so long. And it did seem to drag in several scenes"
Daniel K,2,The movie is entertaining but also a lot different from the original story
Denise G,5,The music was fantastic - really enjoyed the entire movie.
Christy,3,"Not my favorite Disney live action remake. It started off very slow and dark, but got better as the movie progressed. But the worst part is that they left Sebastians arch enemy out Chef Louis! That couldve made the movie so funny, so I was very disappointed with that."
Cindy L,3,The animated version was better.  Ursula and Sebatian were great.  The new songs were good but sort of stuck out as not quite part of the original score.  Flounder looked like a rubber aquarium fish. The movie was enjoyable but not needed.
Ann Warmkessel,5,"Saw movie with our 8 year old granddaughter. Loved it. The effects were superior and Eric and Ariel were adorable. Saw the original with my children , loved it then, thought this remake was wonderful,  as well."
Shanquifa,0,"My eyes, my hears, my god!! After being a fan of the little mermaid since my childhood, I can’t believe they did that to her story! Disney swooped so down on us.."

Maribel C,5,Beautiful movie Halle Bailey and the rest of the cast were fantastic the effects amazing. Thank you for taking us back Under the Sea.
Stacey,5,"Halle is the perfect Ariel. She truly knocks it out of the park. The chemistry between her and Jonah is so great and really makes you fall in love with them by the end. Your kids will love it too, they have great musical sequences. Its not TLM 1989 but where they took liberties, they did a good job. Go see it!"
Micheal M,5,"A truly refreshing take on a classic story. The original songs they snuck in were catchy and whimsical, my daughter loved it! The casting was excellent Melissa McCarthy and Hallie both shone in such a unique role. I can one hundred percent recommend seeing this with children and older friends alike."
Christopher,5,"The Little Mermaid is my favorite Disney Movie! I went into this movie with an open mind and it was such a treat! I loved this movie, I found myself dancing along in my seat and having to contain myself from singing along out loud LOL. So as a diehard life long Little Mermaid Stan I was very satisfied with how much of the original movie they kept intact and pleasantly surprised with the changes made from the original that really made this movie its own thing. This was not just some copy and paste of the original (Looking at you Lion King)."
Linda,5,Great animation great voices when singing
Sandy,5,I really loved this movie!! It's definitely a must see.
J,5,Did not expect to like the movie as much as I did! Halle Bailey absolutely KILLED it! Her vocals are so powerful and clear and the acting was great! I didn't even really think about how Flounder and Sebastian looked. Also Javier Bardem? Fantastic as King Triton. And don't even GET me started on Prince Eric!
Ellie,3,"Although the film certainly dragged on during some scenes, overall it was enjoyable. It was a good recreation with a wonderful cast. I will enjoy watching it at home someday with the brightness turned up."
kirk,2,Erics signing sucked!!! And the movie was SO boring!!!
Melissa,5,Did a great job at telling the story
Courtney,4,10 out of 10! Definitely recommend watching! Such a great remake. They stayed true to the original story but added a little extra that I enjoyed! Definitely going to see it again!

Amanda,5,I loved everything about this movie
KELLEEN I,5,LOVE LOVE LOVE it - every minute!!!!!!
Lisa S,5,"Great  movie! Liked the singing, heartfelt story line and the costumes  were amazing"
Nicole,5,Movie was good. One can really appreciate the lengths Disney goes to create live adaptations.
Jaime,5,I love that it kept the original story line with just a few enhancements. Halle Bailey and Daves Diggs were amazing!
Sara,2,The cinematography left a lot to be desired. It could not be compared to the original
Kia,5,"Beautiful! Job well done! I was never a fan of the original, this remake made me fall in love in a brand new way."
Julie,5,"Absolutely beautiful movie. Halle Baileys voice is angelic, and Melissa McCarthy shines as Ursula. So many fun moments, and I love the cast diversity!"
Natasha,5,Loved it - great movie!!
Natania,5,"Like my old favorite, but even better! I love how they gave us a more realistic cultural context for the story. Being in a Caribbean-like setting enhanced the film, while still staying true to the original movie. They did a fantastic job of hitting those key scenes almost exactly! I would gladly  watch it many more times."
Michael,5,I love this live action version 🧜🏾‍♀️ 🧜🏾‍♂️
Lizbeth,5,absolutely loved it!
Andrea G,5,Absolutely captivating. I loved it!
TATIANA T,5,"LOVED, probably Disney's best live action remake yet. Hailey did Ariel true justice,  bravo!!!!"
Wesley S,5,"Absolutely beautiful film that wonderfully holds all of the things we loved of the original, while adding depth and nuance to the characters we know and love. It also has a wonderful Caribbean flair to it that is awesome."
Marzetta,5,Halles singing is absolutely angelic. For this to be her acting debut she did well. Everyone did a good job bringing the cartoon story to life. Melissa McCarthy played Ursula well. Me and my family really enjoyed the movie
Robert M,4,"It's a film for a younger audience. From my 69 year old perspective, it was ok. My 8 year old granddaughter loved it. That's really all that mattered to me. Halle Bailey and Joshua Hauer-King were quite good both with singing and acting. Melissa McCarthy really captured the snarky malevolence of the character Ursula. I never tire of Awkwafina's delivery."
Linda  G,0,Couldn’t watch this movie. Fire alarm went off after 10 minutes into the movie. I was crushed
Whitney,5,Loved every second of it! 20/10 would recommend.
Melissa Q,5,Amazing! Halle Bailey does an amazing job! The cgi was a little ehh but the movie was a great time. Saw it in 4D & had a blast
Sylvia B,5,"Probably the best live action Disney movie we've seen. Singing was great, underwater and above water scenes were great and acting (live and vocals) were great. Halle Bailey was perfection and Melissa McCarthy as Ursula is a treasure. A must SEA movie!"
Mariela,5,"It was a great movie, Love it"
Brandon Richardson,3,"The new material was either hit or miss. Some things worked, and some didn’t. Even though some CGI was wasn’t perfect, there were stellar 3D effects. Also, Bailey and McCarthy were golden and perfectly cast. The Little Mermaid (2023) is no masterpiece, but it certainly is one of the better Disney remakes."
rosemary U,5,loved the movie everything was perfect my daughter loved it too will watch it again
Justin,4,"Halle Berry is sensational! The iconic music, bright color palette, & story remain faithful to its predecessor. McCarthy nails Ursula while the cast performances will leave you wanting more. Ariel & Eric chemistry felt organic. A good time for all families!"
Nancy Fecca,5,Loved it start to finish!
Misty  R,3,Melissa McCarthy was brilliant. Cgi was a little weird in parts. Most of it was magical. Leads were sweet.
Amber,5,"This movie was so good! As a Little Mermaid fan since the age of two, it was so nice to be back in Ariel's story and to fall in love with it all over again. Halle Bailey embodied Ariel and it was truly magical to finally see her as our favorite mermaid! I found myself practically swooning over Prince Eric and loved the depth they added to his character, along with his and Ariel's chemistry! I went in with some reservations and expectations, but I didn't even give those a second thought once fully immersed in the movie. Truly loved the entire cast, and all of the new songs were great additions! I will say that I wish Colleen Atwood had shown out more with Ariel's wardrobe, because it left a bit to be desired with how few outfits she had to wear. Would have loved to see her in a ball gown at least, but especially the victory/seafoam dress when Triton turns her back into a human. To sum it up, in a time where the live action remakes seem almost played out, this one truly felt like a reimagining in the best way! A way that doesn't feel like it was copy and pasted from the original, but instead inspired by and added to the world of the classic tale that we all love so much without straying too far from the source material. One of the best Disney live actions so far, right up there with Cinderella for me!"
Erin,5,absolutely loved this movie !!
Sung C,5,"Absolutely genius. The amount of love, care, and attention to detail is just astounding. Fantastic storytelling."
Lauren M,4,"Loved the movie and the actors portrayed the roles amazingly! As a mom of three red head girls, Ariel is their icon. I just wish her hair was more true red like the original. Otherwise she was awesome!!"
Yelena,5,such a fun movie. They did justice to the original and added some of their own flair. it makes me sad this movie received so much hate
Kieva,4,"I enjoyed the movie a lot. It was a beautiful picture. It held my attention and it was balanced comedy, drama, romance, it was awesome. Well done."
Keith Henry Iii,5,Took my 30 year old daughter who grew up on and loved the original to see the latest version of the little mermaid she was very happy with the live action remake.
ce2916,5,The additional songs by Lin Manuel Miranda were unexpected and great! I loved the spin on the characters!
Debbie,5,Loved how realistic it was
Mrtaz15,5,Cute and family oriented
KC,3,"My daughter was pretty upset little mermaid's hair wasn't red. The setting with the movie at sea seemed way different than the cartoon. 
Favorite part was actually Ursula, because she was true to her character and portrayal just like the cartoon."
Jessica,5,AMAZINGGGGGG! We loved it!!
ED,4,It fits the times of todays youth.
Haley C,5,Beautiful recreation of the animated movie.  It was tastefully done.  Melissa McCarthy was phenomenal!   A MUST SEE
Angel,5,Beautiful movie to see with the family
Charlise,5,I loved it! It was a beautiful film and I enjoyed how they expanded the story a bit more. Ariel had fleshed out goals and there was great development and depth with her relationship with Eric.
Mark,5,It was really good. It was faithful to the animated version. I liked the visuals and the story. It was wonderful
A,5,Family oriented movie
Kimberly,5,"so proud of our little Halle, loved this movie and the graphics were WOW."

Mary,5,This was an exciting movie.  I loved the cinimatography and all the action.
Carol,5,This movie was fantastic! I loved it allthere was nothing to dislike!
Arnita,5,It was an Awesome movie for all ages. Absolutely Loved it.

Liz,3,I feel like we could of done without Eric’s singing
Janice,5,It was on point of the original Disney version. Loved it !!!
Adriana A,5,It was a beautiful movie.
Disney,0,Changing a character that people grew up with instead of creating  new one.
Craig E,5,This was really entertaining and fun.
Grandmother,5,"Beautiful colors, 3D is fun and actors exceptional!"
Joseph,3,It was actually a good movie.  All you gotta do is go watch it for yourself.  The only annoying actress was Awkwafina playing Scuttle.
Jackie,3,"Didnt like that Ariel didnt look like we have known her to look all this time, but they tried to make everyone else look as they always have. Her acting was well done but she just never felt like Ariel to me and it made me focus on it no matter how much I didnt want to. I Didnt like Sebastians voice nor King Tristans voice/accent which loses its nostalgia for a long time fan.  Cinematography was amazing, and Ursula was well done. But Disney tried too hard to make this movie about inclusivity of races rather than just focusing on leaving the classic Little Mermaid that everyone knows and loved as close to the original as possible like is done for most other live action films.  Sad to be disappointed."
Sean,5,Loved everything about it!
Movie lover,5,A must see! Disney did a fantastic job of this live version of little mermaid. All the songs we wanted to hear were performed perfectly children and adults alike will enjoy this movie
Caroline,5,Halle Bailey did an amazing job at bringing Ariel to life. Her voice is compared to a siren in the movie and it is just that. The songs both old and new are wonderful and catchy.
DeeDeeF,5,"Music, production all excellent.  Very enjoyable."
Marsica Spalding,5,"I loved the casting, story and music. It was very nostalgic.... And especially loved the diversity in this movie. Well done, Disney!!!"

Google,5,We saw it in real 3D with d box and enjoyed the movie!
averina,5,The movies was amazing loved everything about it.
mike m,4,"The movie is really good it has some changes from the animated movie, but other than that it’s still a good movie for the whole family some parts I didn’t like was the casting for Sebastian he didn’t sound good and he looked really weird and the way they did Scuttle was wow not in a good way they made Scuttle into a girl and (he) doesn’t look like a seagull he looks like short crane. Halle Bailey is great as Ariel her voice was amazing the music is awesome the music is just like the animated, Melissa McCarthy as Ursula was outstanding the cast was great and there’s a couple of special people that appear in the movie and those people voiced Ariel and Sebastian from the animated movie. I think that this movie is one of best Disney remakes ever I put it on my list at #2 on my list of the remakes I put it behind Beauty and the Beast as the best remakes"
Mary,5,"Great special effects, loved all the actors and music!!"
Ana,5,"Surpassed my expectations, my childhood is complete!!"
rohan a,2,"Blatantly miscast!  Played more like a horror story than a fairy tale. Singing was uninspired. Actors were just reading lines. No chemistry between performers, What  are the people in Disney thinking??? Stick with the animated version, Save your 29 bucks! Someone remarked the prince was prettier than the mermaid. Ha!"
Anita,5,It was all around excellent movie.
Leo,5,Music was perfect the pace of the movie was exceptional great acting throughout!
Ashley,5,It was great! Beautiful visuals. Excellent choice or actors/actresses for their roles. Outstanding!

Johnathan,2,Boring just like the original
ThatOneChick,4,"The movie was really good. I give 4 stars because some of the singing was cringe, but again, overall good. I might have enjoyed it more if there werent screaming/running children everywhere."
Deione,5,Loved it! The black Ariel added a special touch.

Glenda R,5,This movie is a great feat of modern movie making. It is excellent. I’m a grandmother and I loved that movie as much as the kids did.
NickWrightData,5,"FANTASTIC! Absolutely the best Disney Live Action movie they've ever made, and while that's not saying much, The Little Mermaid KNOCKS IT OUT OF THE PARK!!

Absolutely incredible movie, would recommend! I cried!!"
Jessica,5,"Amazing graphics, engaging, Ariel is sweet and adorable.

Renee P,5,Loved it! Great additions to the regular story.
Bryan,2,Classic animated films need to be left alone. The anticipation that this would be as good as the original was real.....but dissappointed.
Monet,5,This movie was AMAZING!! Halle was great!! I’m so glad they chose her!! Her voice is PERFECT for this role and she is stunning! 10 outta 10 would watch again!

MISSMAMAS,5,ABSOLUTELY LOVED THIS MOVIE... I LIKED HOW THEY DIDN'T CHANGE THE CHARACTERS KEPT THEM THE SAME WITH A MODERN TWIST... ..AS AN ADULT I ENJOYED WATCHING ONE OF MY CHILDHOOD CLASSIC MOVIE AND TOO SEE THE KIDS REACTIONS AS WELL....
Chrissy,5,"The movie was 10 STARS, MY girls love it and can't stop talking about how much they want to be a mermaid"
Jim,3,It was decent. About what I expected.
Stormy,5,I loved that the roles of Ariel and Eric where wished when it came down to defeating Ursula.
Keith,1,"Horribly long, was too long for the kids, not true to the first Little Mermaid, grandkids and grownups disliked the new songs"
Trenecia Edwards,5,The movie was awesome! Halle Bailey did an amazing job! Love every minute of it.
Cody,5,"This is the first live action Disney movie I've seen that I felt was actually necessary.
The emotions of this story are sooooo much more impactful when told with live actors"
leona l,5,"The music, the story and the ACTING !!"
Nina,1,the rock scene was horrible
Seonhwa,2,"It's just a typical Disney Little Mermaid story.  It's just that the exciting song but not exciting atmosphere, and awkward acting..."
Myra,5,EVERYTHING! The cast was amazing.  The music was great!   We had lots of fun singing along :)
Tenecia S,5,Very well done and entertaining.
John,5,The movie had a good set of meaning of showing love even though a person is different regardless of their life raised environment
Raquel,5,"Enjoyed it so much, I saw it twice. Once through regular viewing and 4DX. 4DX was the best experience and made the film even better. Highly recommend."
Melissa,5,Halle was great! I also LOVED Melissa McCarthys performance. Well done bringing this fictional story to life.
Aj,5,Music was great we watched in 3d it was a good picture and experience fun to see the recreation I still have the vhs but the old picture I could not get my child to watch thanks for remaking this film looking forward to more remakes of Disney
Denise Bates,5,"Halle Bailey is a revelation as Ariel!  Her performance was touching and tender. The love of her father was so evident in Bardem’s portrayal. Daveed Diggs and Awkwafina kept the comic relief going as the cooky Sebastian and Scuttle. I would have loved to have seen Lizzo stretch her acting chops as Ursula (as was rumored) but Mellisa McCarthy, is always wonderful and was appropriately scary.  Disney should be applauded for having the courage to make such a culturally relevant and sensitive portrayal of the story.  This version will be loved around the world and will become classic!"
Karen,4,"I never saw the original, but this was worth seeing.  I loved the acting! I loved how this movie had a very diverse cast! No one was left out, so one could identify with many of the characters. The singing was great!! (Halles voice was made for this role!)  i saw this in 4DX (which i highly recommend). This is just a good movie that had me talking to the people next to me! The storyline was good  we laughed and sometimes had a tear- but we all cheered at the ending..Melissa McCarthy surprised me.Love her!  But i never even recognized the king (played by Javier Bardem). I think the cast was perfect.i look forward to seeing my Disney!!!"
TJ,5,"Invigorating , the graphics was so great and amazingly detailed. Loved every bit of the movie."
Kathryn,5,Best Disney live action I’ve seen so far.
Irvins N,5,the movie was fantastically amazing I like how they reprise part of your world at least three times it was perfect in each scenario that it was played. Sebastian was the funniest in the movie each character flourished wonderfully and my God Halle performance 👏 I highly recommend this movie to anyone newcomers old fans of the '90s film it was really beautiful I had me in tears towards the end.
T S,5,I liked the setting and the singing!
Lowla,5,Super excellent movie. we a great twist. Have the right amount of improvement . Amazing job!! I wish no nonsense comments bashed the amazing work of art !!
Stephen,4,"Really enjoyed this movie! Stays true to the 1989 film in so many ways, but also fees free to explore things a bit more. Good balance of originality and faithfulness to the source material. I love how they handled Ariel and Erics relationship in this version! It took things deeper and was really sweet. Vocals were fantastic as well. Very cool camera work during the songs too. I had a few little things I didnt like, but they were mostly nit-picky. Overall, very enjoyable film!"
Tia,5,This was an awesome movie! I personally think that it was a great movie that the whole  family wil enjoy!
Liam,5,"Seen this movie 3 times now! And planning on seeing it more. Beautiful film, Halle the perfect Disney princess."
Kyra,5,It was a great live action movie!
Nick Wingert,5,Fantastic live adaptation! Even better watching in IMAX.
Bella,4,Disliked the voice of scuttle. A lot of talented and unique voices to use and was disappointed.
Az,5,"Amazing movie! Great visuals. Great music. Entertaining, cute and funny!"
Derrick H,1,"This isn't a good movie. Ariels hair isn't even red. It was too long. It needed to shave about 40 mins off. The designs of flounder sebastian and scuttle are just bad. the new songs are atrocious, and the old songs are poorly redone. They lacked the fun and joy the original had. the acting was bad except for Ursula. the changes to the plot made for disjointed storytelling. Ariel lacks any real motivation. The movements of the mermaids looked off. I give it a 2/10. wait for streaming. Even then, don't bother just watch the original. Don't WASTE your Money"
Kathleen C,5,"This is my favorite live action remake of the Disney animated movies.  I was totally enthralled with all of the characters.  Halle Bailey and Melissa McCarthy, as well as the whole cast were absolutely outstanding."
Google,5,I liked all the details and how it looks like we are in the movie as well
Amanda,5,"This was an excellent choice for the family. The colors popped out at you, while the songs were upbeat and cheerful. It had plenty of cute moments that made you giggle out loud."
Kari,5,it was funny and very cute. my 3yr old niece really enjoyed it 🥰
Kiki,5,Beautiful! Heartwarming! Almost had those happy sentimental tears at the end that come with all those extra hormones having kids. They blended the scenes and music from the original to this so artistically. And our main character was perfect! So pretty and youthful looking.
Meridian83642,2,"The songs were good, moments of great graphics but it was terribly slow paced for children."
Mark Ravanilla,5,"We saw this film in 4dx. Halle Bailey was an incredible lead, and Melissa McCarthy’s Ursula was fantastic!!! The new songs are adorable and hilarious! Awkwafina was amazing as well!!!"
Pamila,5,"Loved it, even the new songs! I had a couple of editing issues, but performances were great, and the Colors! And Alvin Ailey Dance Company even got into it!
Wonderful!"
Barbara,4,I loved it!! So cute and even better then the original
jamon k,3,Halle Bailey and Melissa McCarthy save an otherwise BLAND Disney retread.

Tracy L,5,"Loved everything, from beginning to end!! Were going to see it again!! A Must See!!"

David,5,Very well done! The whole family enjoyed from 5 years old to 92 years old. It was also a clean movie.
Daniel,5,I it was a good movie and it’s also funny movie

Kellie,5,My 3 year old and I loved this remake and the new songs added!!
Cristina H,5,Great movie. They kept true to the original story but with a modern adaptation. Some new songs but it still has the Disney enchantment of the first movie. A little Mermaid for today and Disney nailed it!
Mable H,5,Everything was soo diverse and the message in the movie was soo clear! A mermaid that looks and sings like an Angel from Heaven! Halle was Amazingly breathtaking! What a wonderful site to see!
KingKO,4,Beautiful movie with a wonderful lead. Similar to the original movie with many changes here and there that make it very refreshing and funny.
Aniel.GM,5,OUTSTANDING! 🤩😍🤩 #OUTOFTHISWORLD 🎶🎶🎶

Nikita,5,Ms. Halle ATE! and didn't leave a crumb behind.
Melissa D,4,Better than the original
Alex W,5,Amazing adaptation! Disney finally gets it  hopefully this continues.
Ahmad B,4,Love the inclusiveness! I gagged when the mermaids came to the surface and they were all different colors and sizes. Soundtrack was pretty dope too!!!
Tim,5,"A beautiful and touching telling of the animated film, expanding to more fully explain some of the weaker plot elements of the animated film and joyfully bringing into to 2020s. Loved every moment and note of it. The cast is spectacular and SPOILER ALERT  pay attention in the market scene for the food seller, Jodi Benson, voice of the animated Ariel.  Couldnt ask for a better way to start your summer!"
Jennifer M,4,it was beautifully made.  My grand daughter and I enjoyed very much.
Julanne,4,10/10 highly recommended
Tyler,5,Everything was good A1
j.engelmann,4,A decent effort. obviously not as good as the original but Halle Bailey does an impressive job as Ariel but this movie belongs to Melissa McCarthy as Ursula who knocks it out of the park.
suz,2,Not the best remake.  liked the mermaid.
Sami,5,I liked everything! Amazing visuals! Amazing acting! Love! Lots of hotties!
John Cameron C,5,Loved this movie a lot. Definitely a must see. I agree with the critics are saying about this movie being really good.
Mitch J,4,"Really wonderful movie, my whole family loved it"
Mariah,5,I liked the fact that the movie could be tailored to little boys and girls and adults as well. All the actors and actresses played their part
Rhonda E,5,"Absolutely amazing! 
Recommend 8years and up. 
Music and cinematography was spectacular. 
And it was NOT too long"
Anita T,5,Loved the diversity. There's no racism under the sea! The color under water was so vibrant wish it was on land as well. Halle is much better than I expected. I was not disappointed.
zavier,5,The movie was so perfect! They had every detail right and it was amazing.
Heather Smarelli,5,Very fun and colorful! Classic songs plus new ones from Lin Manuel Miranda that will become classics!
Franco,5,"The acting, visuals and sound design were phenomenal and it stayed true to the original. Great movie, I’d recommend"
shannel  d,5,"Loved l was able to follow the script and sing a longs.  
Loved the added scenes with Prince Eric nd the voiceless Arial. 
Disappointed in the gentleness of King Triton. 
But overall lm still in love with the little mermaid Movie. 
Ursula was amazing"
Cassandra,3,"Meh. I was SO looking forward to this and while it brought moments of laughter and joy, it fell a little flat. Loved Ursula though,  thought she was awesome! overall it didn't stray from the original story line,  but there were moments I would've savored more and others that felt too slow for what was going on.  I'm glad I saw it,  but won't care to own it or probably ever watch it again lol"
Crystal,5,Wonderful movie! We loved it
Donald,5,"The movie gave me chills…especially the ending. To see unity between human and mermaid, if only more humans yearned to do this with one another.🧸"
Belle,4,It expanded upon the story and characters without taking anything away. Allen Menken returned for the score and once again helped capture that Disney magic!
Jonathan,5,Live  action was so beautiful
Linda L E,5,The movie was exceptional Halle Bailey was excellent and should get an Oscar for her portrayal of Ariel
Pat,5,"underwater scenes, new songs by Lin-Manuel"
Kristine,5,Halle Bailey and the whole cast were amazing!!! She was the prefect Arielle!
Google,5,absolutely beautiful movie
William B,3,"Parts were a little slow, but it was good overall"
Autumn,5,It was super cute and really interesting to watch I couldn’t look away
Chastity,1,I had high hopes and was let down terribly.
Ricky  G,5,My wife and I loved how it was extremely realistic and we could understand all the words in the songs they sang.  It is a wonderful movie for older children and adults.
Joe Tufano,4,Among the better of the live action remakes with a star making performance by Halle Bailey and a deeper look into the romance between the two leads further justifying the film’s existence.
Katrina,5,"Incredible!!  Disney did amazing things, especially in 3D!! My 4 year old loves it as well!"
Jeanne,5,"I didn't expect to like it as much as I did, but I can gladly say, I LOVED IT!!!"

Darrel Collins,5,Excellent Movie for a remake of an animated version.
Patricia Jacobs,5,Watched in 3 D. The graphics were amazing.
Dominique D,5,Beautiful movie. Halle and Melissa did an amazing job.
Caroline,4,I like the fact that we were able to exchange our tickets last min cause other things happened definitely recommend using this app.
Amanda,5,I loved this movie.  It has the spirit of the animated movie while expanding on the story.  Halle Bailey sang the heck out of those songs.  Truly enjoyable.
henny,2,"It was okay, I was very disappointed that they didn’t give her a a nice dress and why would they cut off the part where her dad gives legs. I was just very disappointed"
Jay,4,Really long but it was a good watch. A lot of unnecessary singing.
Daniel,5,Very well done.  Great cast! Musical parts were fanatic.  I highly recommend watching!
Sue,5,loved the visuals but the violent scene was a bit heavy for kids.
Mo,5,Actors were excellent!!! Movie was done with excellence!! Superb!
Alex S,5,"I thought it was a great movie, my 4 year old like it as well although one part was a little scary for her!"
Eric,4,"Overall I enjoyed it. With the exception of the giant Ursula scene, the CGI was outstanding! I guess they went over budget with all the ""under water"" scenes they didn't have enough to make Ursula more realistic. But it's the Little Mermaid."
Frank M,5,"The singing performances of Ariel, Ursula were excellent. Both their acting was great as well, as expressive as a Disney cartoon would get. Not many actors for previous Disney remakes were able to capture the cartoony facial expressions."
cindy,5,great special effects
Debbie,4,Like the scenes that were added made more like Ariel would do.
Enrica M,5,Amazing!!! Halle Bailey was phenomenal
Ashley,5,Better than I imagined and you have to see it in the 3D version bc then youre really under the sea!
Ariel Y,2,The actors and story was not the best. I wouldve loved to see more of the original. Not the best Disney remake.
Gaby,5,This movie was so beautifully made Im so happy for Halle!
Sharika,5,Everything was amazing.
Deb,5,Loved the the actress playing Ariel!!
Christina T,5,"They did an absolutely phenomenal job remaking this Disney classic! From the opening scene to the last moment, I kept gasping, laughing, crying. The visuals were beautiful and the songs (classic and new) were so fun! I took my daughter to see it and I'm so glad I can say this is the first movie she ever saw in a theater!"
john,3,The movie was just ok. I thought the animation was good. It was a good looking movie to watch. The characters were ok. Some fit and some didn't. Overall I think if you're a fan of Disney films then you'll want to see it so you say you did but it's just an okay movie.
Penelope,5,Brought back great memories from the original Disney cartoon.
Ryan Burke,5,"Disney Did It Again, Another Great Live-Action Film! Halle Is Gonna Win Her Oscar!"
Mya B,5,Story is encouraging little girls to swim.
Steve K,5,"Enjoyed the Ride. There were some things that were changed that were unnecessary, some new songs that seemed unnecessary, etc. but overall the movie gave what it promised. The special effects were well done and brought you into the world. The acting was well done and dealt with a difficult prospect (of having a conversation with a puppet crab). Family friendly time!"
Kaybird,5,This was amazing. Loved it.
lis,5,I loved all about this movie!!!
Barbara,5,Would see it again! It was excellent!
Jasmine,5,Perfect casting. Amazing music and acting. Wonderful visuals
Thalia P,4,"Great classic scenes and songs! A few new cool scenes and songs too, overall such a nostalgic feeling :)"
Facebook U,5,Kept to the original while still bring something fresh and new!!! Love love loveddd it!!!!!
Tiera,5,Amazing !! This movie took me back to my childhood. I was smiling from ear to ear and dancing throughout the entire movie. I literally had tears in my eyes. Halle did a great job !!
Shakira,3,I mean as a young African American woman I was hoping that the creator would have her project more of her ethnicity. I was hoping for a bit of sad and culture. I didnt see any of it. I did love that there was strong diversity. It was great start. But I was really hoping for more.   Her singing as always was phenomenal but they should definitely had HER come more out.
Esther B,5,"Well done, beautiful."
M,4,"Pretty good live action Disney movie. CGI is a little rough, but it’s still a good watch."
Joleen H,5,"This was a well-done, clean, and enjoyable movie perfect for the entire family to watch. My children grew up with the original classic, and last night, I brought my 79 year old mother to view this one. Even though I enjoyed the show, watching the joy it brought to her face was priceless. 

The music was fantastic! The only heads-up I'd give aren't related to the movie itself. The previews add another 25 minutes to the time, so be prepared for a long show. Also, I am not sure if it's just this theater, but this is the 2nd time the volume was so loud it hurt our ears. We put tissue in our ears to help muffle the sound. Next time, I will bring ear plugs."
Averi,5,This movie in all aspects was absolutely fantastic. 3-D just topped it. Halle did a fantastic job as Ariel and Melissa McCarthy absolutely slayed the role of Ursula!!! Loved this movie from top to bottom. Im a 90s baby so Im all for original but the creators of this movie did a beautiful job
Alice P,4,loved the 3D version
Sean,5,Outstanding! Well done Disney. New family favorite!
LR,5,The movie is an amazing live version of the original. The original is my favorite movie and this one did not disappoint. Halle Bailey is amazing as Ariel! They did a great job casting. The one sign they could have left out was Eric’s. But overall great film. All these people who have given it low ratings are not being genuine and probably haven’t even seen the film.  But it’s hard to see past your hatred. Great film and a must see.
Suz,5,Beautiful movie! Fabulous musical talent!
Deonika,5,"Great movie!! So moving and nice to watch another princess that looks like me ! BRAVO , seen it twice so far!"
Valarie M,5,It was so much fun! Don't believe the naysayers. Loved the performances and songs. Everyone was well cast.  I was astonished that there were so many quiet children in the showing I attended. They were riveted. There was even a baby who never made a peep. I didn't even know the infant was there until the lights came up. I'm a grown woman who now really wants a mermaid tail.
HellenK,5,The whole movie was amazing!
Gwendolyn,4,"It was an Amazing film for any age.  I took my great great nieces to see it and to watch how attentive they were and really drawn into the storyline brought a smile to my face.  There were so many talking points to explain to them that good and evil are always present, but we have to believe that good will prevail.  The film showed how differences creates prejudice against others, but once the heart is open, there will always be acceptance.  Maybe, this world can imitate life through Disney eyes!!"
Gus N,5,The film was well done. My family and I lauged through out the film. I was hoping that Disney wouldn't mess up this live action movie and they did not disappoint. Very good!
Gabriela,5,"Easily the best live action Disney movie! I cannot begin to describe how absolutely beautiful, breathtaking, and extraordinary it was! On top of that, every single role was perfection!"
j p,1,Waste of time and money they should stop making more Disney movies
Lorraine,5,It was wonderful!!!!
Nisey G.,5,The Little Mermaid was an enchanting movie and I shed a few tears of happiness at the end.
Obed,5,"i loved this movie! Halle as Ariel, blew me out of the water! she is great, and was meant for this role. the whole movie is just simply great! the music, magic, everything! my inner child is definitely extremely happy."
D lo,4,"Halle was honestly a delight to watch in this version of The Little Mermaid. Her voice is stunning, her acting was very limited due to her character so you can’t judge her acting based on this film. Chemistry between the characters felt real in my opinion. Everyone was cheering for Halle’s moments. It felt good to have people support her and not bash on her like most people are online. She deserved to be recognized and respected"
Fasil,5,"Wow! What a great time watching this. Definitely the best of the live action reimaginings but also a great movie on its own! Halle Bailey was a knockout as Ariel and perfectly brought her innocence, curiosity, and determination to life from the animated movie (along with her incredible voice). The rest of the cast were all great, especially Jonah Hauer-King who really elevated Prince Eric to much more than just a pretty face. His and Ariels romance felt so earned from their friendship built on shared interests and hopes. The new songs were also fun (Halles For the First Time was a standout sequence in the film — what a great way to give Ariel more songs and show her excitement and nervousness for the human world). The story changes felt welcome here and only added to the intensity to add to the stakes of Ariels journey. 

The CGI was also great, nothing at all that looks bad that it takes you out of the film. The very slight changes to the original songs are so minimal that you truly dont even notice them."
Annemarie,5,"The Little Mermaid was very well done! It took a bit to shift from anticipating an exact redo of the original and to see this new version as its own movie. I really liked getting more of the back story about Prince Eric. Overall, very nicely done and Halle Bailey as Ariel was a fantastic choice!"
J,4,"I really liked this movie! Halle has such an amazing singing voice! Even though Ive seen the animated version a million times I was still anxious about what would happen next. I liked most of the new songs, but there was 1 that was a little cringey for me. All in all one of the better Disney remakes!"
Nic,5,"It was everything I ever dreamed of!
Truly phenomenal, in every sense of the word!"
F D,1,"Just a retelling of the original with no real further character development or plot line.  Eric's song was cringe worthy.  I especially didn't like the animation of the mermaids and Ursala looks like she is straight out of the Exorcist at the end.  This falls way short of Malificent, Cruella, or even Aladdin.  Disney is capable of so much more..."
Paula T,3,"I liked the movie.  The realism/animation was nice.  I wasn't sure how they would pull off the animation in real-life but it worked. Without giving away anything, the ending actually made me tear up a bit. I was 'on the fence' with going, since the critics didn't like it, but, sometimes they get it wrong."
Merikay,4,It was colorful and had lots of great music. My grandchildren all loved it.
Google,4,"My daughter LOVED this movie, and so did I. Think it is a great family movie. Great reenactment of the original."
Anita W,5,Nice little Caribbean tone to the mermaids land experience.  Melissa McCarthy nailed Ersula's image.  Perfect Ariel and Eric characters.
Brent J,4,Haille Bailey was sensational! Side characters were good. Music was great!
Rhonda,5,I loved the Movie.  It was designed for Adults and well as kids.  Halle Bailey was wonderful.  I also like Jonah Hauer-King.  they were both great.  The movie keep my interest from start to finish.  A definite must see!  5 Stars.
Kimberly,5,I loved the movie!! It’s the perfect love story
Al H,4,My daughter loved itsweet movie!
Anne P,4,Liked it even more than the original! Didnt love the actor for king triton. And why did all the sisters have to be from different countries? Did love it overall though!
Clarissa J,5,"Amazing movie, outstanding acting on Halle's part, she completely embodied Ariel as a whole.  Halle definitely solidified why TLM is my favorite Disney movie."
George,5,"Great Movie! Wonderful cast, great story and cool effects!!!!!!"
Adelaida,5,Disney never fails.  Awesome Ill never stop watching this kind of movie
Candy,5,Best Mermaid Movie Ever
Shania,4,Hailey did amazing! The little mermaid was never an interesting movie to me as a kid which is why I gave 4 stars. Same story line so it was okay. But Hailey as the little mermaid made me want fins! The graphics were amazing. The singing! No one more perfect for the role. Shes a princess at heart & her energy glows.
Laura F,5,It was awesome. Great Movie
Brianna,5,"I am someone who is obsessed with the original. I even have an Ariel collection. This live-action remake made me so happy. I honestly loved it! Was beautiful and enjoyed the new scenes they added. My only sadness was how little pretty dresses she wore. In the original she has the beautiful pink drink, the blue dress, the sparkly dress, and her wedding dress. We only got a blue dress and then the same dress but white later on. Just something that made me sad but doesn't change how much I enjoyed this movie"
theresa m,4,"The scenery was beautiful and amazing.  The story plot was good but not enough music or romance.
All in all, very nice."
Hector,5,They put enough of the classic for the fans from the original and what they added to the story line and the new songs was incredible
Demetrius W.,5,"Absolutely Beautiful and it is a experience that all families, those who love the classic and those who would like to experience for the first time, to go through. The songs and sequences were top notch and the entire movie was a cinematic masterpiece. Two Giant Thumbs Up!"
Jenna,3,I really appreciated the following of the orihinal storyline! Halle's voice was phenomenal! I was a little put back by the darkness & lack of clarity with the animation. Overall I enjoyed the movie & would watch it again.
kerena,5,Everything was exactly the same as the original it made me laughed it made cry it made me reflect about how differences continue to separate us when we’re all the same
Brianna,5,The best live action remake of a classic Disney film. The original was my favorite when I was a child and now this version will be my favorite as an adult. I really enjoyed Halle as Ariel she was perfect for the role! The entire cast was great! I loved the music and animations as well.
Robert J,3,"It was okay, the movie kind of explained the discrepancies, missed quite a few key moments for me. The ending however, had me rolling in laughter, great way to ruin a moment Disney lol."
ADRIANA L,5,Loved everything about this Movie! We enjoyed it very much @
A.C.,5,The acting and singing were top notch!
Eric,4,Much better than I expected & wife loved the movie. Surprised that Disney didn't sneak any LGBTQ stuff into the movie which was great. The changing of the ethnicity of a couple of characters didn't hurt the movie. Solid!
Chris,4,Very enjoyable retelling of the story with solid CGI and score. Original songs were great but the new songs were forgettable.
Lorena M,3,People weren't the same skin color as the original cartoon disney movie
Google,3,They left out A LOT of iconic parts from the original movie. I saw it in 3D and it made the animations look slightly better
Bella,5,Haters gunna hate. This movie was great. Guess goin woke doesn’t make you go broke. It was an outstanding version of the classic little mermaid story I’ve enjoyed since since I was kid. Disney’s version is much more heartwarming than the original story. I will be seeing this again.
casie j,5,It was my granddaughter first time in a movie theater and at 20 months old she was in awe of the pretty fish as she called her. The movie had beautiful scenes and although it was long the storyline was great as always. She was sleep by the middle of the movie but still the pretty fish was all she could talk about to her mom. Great remake!
Jay Song,3,I like how it was almost spot on with the actual movie.
keally,5,OMG Halle was AMAZING. Like I knew she was gonna be amazing but she was BETTER THAN AMAZING. I love Melissa McCarthy. She was also AMAZING as ursula. I actually didn't think awkwafina was that bad. This is probably my fav live action remake.
Akito,2,The added songs were so unnecessary. Ocean shots were dull and the Under the Sea scene was very underwhelming as well. Ursula parts I loved. Halle has a beautiful voice but her talking scenes  felt forced.
Nicky,5,"Best Disney live action adaptation hands down! Everything about this movie felt so fresh! Loved it so much! Had me crying, laughing & left me so happy."
Eduardo,5,Was happy with the story line
Stephanie,5,"I loved it so much! I laughed and I cried, its the perfect movie I recommend it"
Svtaquatic,5,It was a pretty good movie really enjoyed. The kids had fun.
kaitlyn,4,I loved Halle as the role and despite “controversy” she was amazing and completely fit Ariel. love her love the cast loved the execution it was great
Ashley N,5,This movies was amzingggg! Love every minute of it!
lupe,5,I loved it! And i love how it’s about Ariel wanting to explore the world and the human experiences and not just being boy crazy like the original movie. 3
Mayra,5,I absolutely loved it! Never saw the original animated one (I’m 24 F)  but it was really a great movie
Nefatiry B,5,"I absolutely loved this movie. The songs, the actors, scenes everything was really wonderful. Truly was a great movie."

Amber,5,We absolutely loved it. Got the D Box seats. Totally worth it
Veronica,5,Great movie and graphics ! I would definitely watch this movie again. perfect movie for little ones and adults. The only thing I would change is making flounder brighter.
Joseph,5,"LOVED!!!! One or two spots could have been trimmed, I wished there would have been more singing because the performances were so so beautiful. The movie was gorgeous and so very special. THATS WHAT LOVE is DISNEY STYLE!!!! Destroy woke Take a seat DeSantis & learn more about love, instead of hate! That will be a much better example for our children & the world. God bless Disney for helping us see love as the winner!"
Angel Eyes,5,A must see! This version is like the classic little mermaid and full with action it's emotion and funny   I was stunned also the audience clapped at the end...
Karen C,4,The graphics were off the hook but it was too long. Some scenes could have been cut to develop continuity with the story. CGI was amazing as were the colors.
Cowbunny,2,It was slow. Loved the actors. Felt forced that all nationalities were being represented in the movie . . . took away from the continuity of the movie.
Kinedy,5,Went to see it for the second time. Loved it even more this time.
Mariela Balderas,5,Ariel was always my favorite princess growing up. Always a little girls dream to be a mermaid. I am 25 years old my my inner child was happy with this movie. I loved that they did so much similarities but a little different from the original movie. Will forever cherish this in my heart. My childhood thanks you for this movie
Albert M,4,Great balance of keeping the classics that everyone loves and adding new touches that make it fun to experience it again.
John,4,Great CGI Special Effects
Oscar L,5,Best Live action Disney princess yet
Shaunte,5,Absolutely loved the movie
RMH,4,All in all it’s a good movie. When you compare it to the original though it didn’t live up to the same level magically. Musical numbers were lacking in my opinion.
Ashley,5,I loved everything about the movie!
Mz Hollywud,5,"I enjoyed all of the movie, it had great theatrics. The graphic designs & colors was amazing. Hats off to Aerial (Hailey B) great performance. The movies was packed with all cultures & ages."
Movie Attic,5,Amazing special effects.  Captivating scenes.  Loved it !!!! Great movie for adults and children.
C,2,It was ok and it didn't help that people take their children and don't supervise them let them run around yelling and crying asking to go home but they keep them there.
theresa  g,3,The actors selected for the role were almost exact.
LJ,5,This movie was beautifully done. I loved the diversity of the characters and the storyline.
Allen,5,Gave new meaning to the original film.
Reb,5,Great cast and music.
Melody,5,I loved the music and the actors were diverse and fantastic. Cinematography was on point.
Shellbee,3,"Movie was good, but I expected it to be more colorful. Also a little too sing-songy for me. But the acting was great and we had a good time."
Niki,2,"I had hopes for this movie, it was a let down. The sets and location and cinematography were the only things I liked. Too many unnecessary story changes which were meaningless and hurt the pacing."
Jasper,5,My wife loved the movie!
Tatyana,5,It was an amazing movie loved every second
Cheryl,5,excellent. loved it.
Google,5,Absolutely Spectacular!!!! Halle ate that up!!!!!
Anfani Vincent,5,"Incredible movie! So much nostalgia. They took a lot of scenes right from the original. Very diverse casting. A lot of heart and visually STUNNING! 

Also…HALLE BAILEY IS ethereal looking. It’s hard to take your eyes off of her. She’s just that good and beautiful. I’m seeing it again."
Tracy D,5,Wonderfully done!!! My children grew up with Ariel and now my granddaughter can sing along to this amazingly fun and adventurous remake. Haille was Perfect!!

Isabela A,5,So fun and amazing! The acting and visuals were incredible!! Love it but the ending was a little rushed.
Aaron,5,Halle Bailey is amazing :)
EAD711,3,"Sebastian was a great character 

Flounder way too skinny

Ariel missing red staple hair color"
Katie,5,I grew up on Little Mermaid and I thought it turned out super cute. My girls loved it as well. I didnt really notice much change in lyrics as was mentioned before watching.
Raj,1,"The CGI graphics were poor & choppy, looked like a 10 year old movie.  The acting was pretty bad by Aerial she just seemed awkward.  Had high hopes but was pretty disappointed.   Pass on this movie, stick to the original."
Kaitlynn DeVille,5,It was perfect. They kept the magic of the original and added some. See it in 3D!
Maria,5,"It was so good, I have no complaints/dislikes :)"
Dennis M,4,"Music and acting were great. There’s parts that are different from the original animated version, so that was interesting."
Joanna E,5,Ive watched it 3 times. Animation can be a bit off sometimes but story line is precious and the music is chefs kiss!

Ki,5,The animation was amazing. Halle looked beautiful and sound amazing!!
Tamarah,5,I loved all the characters and how they came to life on screen. My Children loved all the songs and of course the fight scene was epic!

Google,5,Halle did an amazing job! No actor could have played the role better.
Jessica,5,Halle Bailey was absolutely fantastic. Best Disney live action remake.
Chante,5,Everything. Best movie seen this year
Stephanie W,5,"Halle Bailey was perfect, the animated was my favorite movie growing up. As an adult it's been replaced with this. It is amazing, they couldn't have done any better."
Brittany,5,We went and saw it twice just to give it an extra boost along with everyone else. Once in regular and once in 3D. The only other time I saw a movie twice in theatre was for the original Avatar. This movie was really enjoyable and beautiful to watch and Ariel and Ursula were awesome and loved the cameo from the original Ariel.
Je T'aime,5,"The colors, cast, music, sound affects, acting skills and other fine details were all perfect! An absolute must-watch. Very beautiful to see all people being represented."
SW,4,Wonderful movie!!  Storyline stayed very close to the original.
Google,5,Super great!! Halle Bailey was amazing!!
Alee,4,"Halle Bailey did a great job playing Ariel, would have wished to see flounder & scuttles look more like the cartoon."
Tom P,2,I left early. It was boring and unnecessary.
Jacqueline,5,"We Love the movie ,The colors in the movie was amazing and the story line was awesome !! 
It's a MOST SEE !!!"
Karen,4,see it in 3D it's makes the movie way better

Aaliyah,5,"Loved the movie, beautiful and hilarious story."
Tito R,4,"The Little Mermaid was so good!  It was the first time the Disney live action remakes have made sense!  This was beautifully crafted and performed.  Halley Bailey has an amazing voice and elevated the nostalgic songs of the original.  It was a tad long, but not terribly so.  I loved Sebastian and Scuttle!"
Ruben,5,I was afraid they would mess up this classic but I loved how they did the movie it was amazing !
Jasmine,5,Very similar to the original. My kids and I really enjoy it.
Dyamond,5,Amazing! Halle did such a great job. It was my first time seeing TLM movie and I loved it.
T,5,Love every moment I thought it wasnt gonna be as good as the original film boy was I wrong great movie
virgnia p,5,The leads voice was wonderful.
Carmen,5,"Love everything , it was so magical, the movie is already one of my childhood cartoons from Disney that is my favorite but the movie was also incredible and I will say the 4DX also made even more powerful . This movie was tremendous, perfect person you chose for Ariel and Eric , love everything , including how the characters were all chosen with a delicacy, marvelous."
Sarah M,4,Absolutely wonderful! Loved it. Halle was fantastic!
vilma,4,Great ! Amazing special effects . Very realistic. Great acting.

Sandi,5,Definitely an absolute MYST SEE
Ashley P,5,Love it great movies!!!
RUDOLPH P,4,Was not too long appropriate for older kids.
Stream Cat & Mouse By Blackswan.,5,"Halle is the best part of this movie, If you're a true og Ariel fan you'll appreciate and love how well Halle honered Jodi's version while also giving her own unique quirks and qualities to the character to further expand Ariel's overall personallity. Something that the original admittedly did fail to do, hence why you see so many "" critics "" and celebrities trashing Jodi's version so easily and carelessly. If you have any issues with this movie, Halle most certainly can't be one."
Sheneka F,4,The movie kept close to the original script and songs with a few surprises. People were able to sing along. It was very nostalgic. The graphics were nicely done. The characters did a great job.
Danielle S,3,There’s was a ton of great new additions but the things that stuck out and bothered me affected my opinion more than the new things I enjoyed. It’s a good movie but I’m glad for the lower priced Tuesdays cause if I’d have seen it on a full price day I’d have been disappointed
dominique,5,It was excatly like the original movie a good must see
Amy S,3,It's a fun movie with good music. It's nothing amazing and the performances can fall flat at times but it's entertaining all the way through
Tabitha J,5,Everything..Halle and Jonah were amazing!!
Google,5,Beautifully diverse! Thankyaaaa!
Insta @cindyfckinrella,5,Seventh time seeing it loved every second of it just as the first RUN dont walk RUN to see this movie
Demi,5,"It was toooo good watched it at night with a friend. Singing fantastic, was honestly funny at some moments (which i didnt expect from a childrens musical), and Lord Almighty—Halle Bailey is heaven sent. Anyone who complained about her being a mermaid all had one thing in common but let me keep my mouth shut."
Luz,5,Just like I've always dreamed it would be.
Jana P,5,Loved it  will see it again
Lorena  L,4,"Brought back memories of the animated movie. Enjoyed with the kids, and now with my significant other. I would watch it again."
Google,5,ariel was perfectly casted!!! cute movie
sonia s,5,I loved watching this movie with my 10-year-old and reliving my childhood memories of watching the original film.  I could watch it 100 times and still love it!
jasssss,4,Loved every part of it ! Music was fireeeeee transitions were impeccable and characters played tf out of their role
Tyanna Walker,5,I love everything about this movie
Michele B,5,Wonderful movie. Soundtrack is definitely going to be on repeat.
L,5,Amazing! Beautiful visual and songs
Erin T,5,"I loved it! The music was great, it followed the original story line so well, and the few additions/changes only added to how awesome it was. My grand daughters ages 5, 9, and 11 all loved it as well."
Darla,5,It was wonderful and I loved all our cultures brought together as one people 💖 beautifully done!
Tiffany,3,Super cute movie for the little ones to see.
cate N,2,"It moved very, very slow. Clearly a lot of covid filming so the shots tended to be all one actor alone and it felt very isolated. The shots tended to last longer than necessary, lots of long ocean shots or underwater shots that didn’t add to the story and were not needed. I also thought the Eric falling under the sea witches spell was poorly done."
Kate N,5,Very compelling. Ariel is a wonder. Thank you Rob Marshall.
Maggie,5,My daughter and her friend loved it.
Cam,5,"The casting was very amazing and seeing it IMAX had the colors and songs sounding ethereal. Only complaint is that Popcaan wasn’t Sebastian. Other than that, perfect movie"
Vicky M,5,it was very well put together and I loved it even though they changed things it was a great movie well done
Jonathan,3,"missed that iconic les poisson scene with chef louie, overall a good movie not fantastic, Disney should create new content instead of trying to remake classic films."
Vern T,5,"Beautiful movie. Long in places, but overall a fun experience. Halle Bailey is a star. Jonah King is a great leading man. Definitely going to see it again."
Amanda,5,"Loved it, the new music added a new dimension to the story! I absolutely loved it!"
Geri,4,Loved the music and animation
Georgina Avila,5,It was so amazing getting to see a little mermaid who resembles my daughter she was in complete awe when she saw her!!  Thank you It was everything we hoped for and more!
Joan R,5,Great Movie true to the classic
Sonya W,5,"I really enjoyed the movie, it was good all the way through. She really played her part."
Michael Cox,3,"THE LITTLE MERMAID (2023) justifies its existence by having Halle Bailey bring Ariel to life. She's bound to shoot for the stars after this. McCarthy eats up her screentime & Diggs is joy as Sebastian. The newer songs are hit or miss, but classic Disney magic's present at points."
Torian,3,The movie is really good.
MsGray,4,"It was really good, I just didn’t expect them to have changed some things."
Google,5,Don't play with it! Halle did her BIG ONE! Don't sleep!!! I'll be watching it again!
Pam S,2,It is too long and very slow.
CWalker,5,The movie was amazing. All of the old charm as well as some new surprises and characters.
Michelle,5,Awesome movie!!! 3D graphics were the best Ive ever seen!!
Juan,3,"Overall wonderful movie, dont go in with any expectations. Take the movie as it is!!"
Evelyn,4,"A must see in 3D! I think Sebastian and Flounder could have been done better, but the rest of the characters were fabulous. My favorite scene was Under the Sea, it was very colorful. I really enjoyed the movie!"
Nana,5,"Live action done beautifully. The scenery, especially under the sea scenes were amazing. My two young grandchildren enjoyed it too!"
Jess,5,"Halle is the perfect Ariel and, while there were some interesting choices with styling during some songs, every bit of the movie was faithful to the classic and then pleasantly surprising. My daughter and I adored it and, im considering a second trip to theaters to watch again!"
Kristen G,5,This movie exceeded all my expectations. So beautifully done. I want to see it again already!
Duane B,5,Good casting and music. It comes alive!!!
Marilyn B,5,Loved the movie. Music and voices were amazing. Despite a few changes from the original cartoon version we all enjoyed it. Best Disney live movie remake
Katelyn,5,This was such a great live adaptation! Ariel was INCREDIBLE. Ursula/Vanessa actresses made an EXCELLENT team. The CGI was beautiful and the story followed the original so perfectly. I loved the changes made as well and 100% recommend this.
JERYL,5,"Disney did this movie absolutely correct. Between the watching this film Regal 4DX platform, the audience’s real-time reactions, and all other departments involved with the production and financing of this movie this has to be the closest I have seen to a perfect film. 100% certified fresh for sure. Extremely entertaining for the entire family!"
Sami,5,The Prince Eric actor's performance during his singing was a little too Broadway. It took me out of the movie a bit. Awkwafina was great in her role. She slayed with what was given to her. Melissa handled her role as Ursula very well. Halle's portrayal drew strong emotions in such a positively immersive way. I normally don't watch movies twice. I would watch this one again.
Trey,4,I actually liked this one better than the original.  The song where Awkwafina raps is hillarious.
Janette,4,I love the Ariel movie it has the exact scenes from the cartoon movie
Antonio C,5,"While there were a couple of Disney surprises, as in, i dont remember that from the original movie, for the most part it was very true to the Little Mermaid as I remember it."
tanesha b,5,I loved everything about this movie. Chloe Bailey did her thing.
James,5,"DEFINITELY A MUST SEE MOVIE 100,000,000 out of 100,000,000.!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Alicia,5,"I couldn’t even pretend that I got tickets for this movie to see with my daughter. This outing was specifically for me and my daughter was invited. I loved this updated take on the original Disney classic. Anytime Halle Bailey opened her mouth to sing, I would get chills! She and the rest of the cast did an absolutely marvelous job and I fully intend to add this movie to my collection once it is given an at home release date!"
Francis,5,The original animation is fun and nostalgic. The live action added some depth to the story line.
Charlotte,4,"Yes, loved the movie.  It was little loud in some spots but overall, it was great."
Jeannine,5,I loved it! Especially in 3D
Pamela Edwards,5,"Loved the 3 d glasses, felt like I was included in the movie.  Gremovie."
T. Thomas,5,"The film was visually stunning, especially in 3D and Halle Bailey's voice was magical. Loved it, wish I could give 20 stars."
Kiana,5,Halle Bailey was absolutely wonderful! Very fun adaptation
caramoon,5,"Our girl was great in this role. 
A must see. I'll see it again in 3D."

Amanda,3,Something's are just better left alone

candice,5,Really good movie. Love Eric and Ariel their relationship was really put together well. 10/10 for me.
Linda,5,Loved it.... Best Cinematography I have ever seen.  Halle Bailey was the perfect Ariel.  Melissa McCarthy was great too.  The prince....... so handsome.
Joy,5,Excellent adaptation of the animated original. Melissa McCarthy was priceless as Ursula! Halle Bailey nailed it as Ariel and the story line was virtually untouched. The cinematography was outstanding. A must see in the theater for full effects.
ChaCha,5,It was amazing. Saw it on 3D. I was singing to mostly every song. Chloe was excellent and sound wonderful. Well put together. Went with my closet friend and she started to cry towards the end. So touching. Loved it!!!
Rebecca,4,Colors/underwater scenes
Sofia,4,I loved the ending and the middle
Sarah,5,The visuals in the movie are so beautiful.  It is a perfect nod to the previous Disney version.  The cast was perfect and the vocals flawless.  I cried 3 separate times and cannot wait to see it again!
Fluffibunni84,5,I loved it. It took me back to the sea. The cast was phenomenal. Ariel sang beautifully. CGI was off in some places but really nice during under the sea.
Maria,5,Halle Bailey did soo good! amazing movie!!
Haley,5,The 3D movie screen was down so we had to wat h the regular version. It was still great!

Dione,5,This movie was amazing. I love you halle

Amy,3,I would reccomend this movie. Anything Disney's I love.
Denise M,3,"Brought my granddaughter to see the movie and it was her first time at a movie theater.  She loved it, as did her mother and I.  Great characters.  A little longer for a four-year-old, but never dragged.  Melissa McCarthy was great as Ursula, and since I love Daveed Diggs, his portrayal as Sebastian was wonderful."
Tiffany,5,It was so awesome to experience in 3-D! It was a really nice wholesome family movie!
Murrie,5,The CGI was absolutely believable! Singing was exceptional!
Michael,5,Very entertaining and close to the original animated  one. Still awestruck with how they made the mermaids and underwater so scenes so realistic. Kudos the special effects people. The scenes of the storms on the sea were quite thrilling. Enjoyed it immensely and can't wait to see the next real life remake of a Disney classic.
Kim,5,My daughter and I loved the movie!! It was partly cast and gray all around!
Patricia L,5,"Very well done. Im not sure if its for small children as there are some scary parts. I like how the movie stuck to the original. The girl who played Ariel was very good, and the Prince was terrific. Very colorful with a huge assortment of sea animals!!!  Really enjoyed it!"
Marilyn,5,very enjoyable to watch
Chay,5,Excellent movie! Casting was outstanding!!
Sharalee,5,I was afraid that another childhood favorite would be ruined like The Lion King - but this great! I loved it! All the characters and the message was lovely. Great job!
Watch4one,5,I liked everything about this movie!
Michelle,5,The movie was so amazing.
Marie C,5,I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. Especially the underwater scenes. They stayed true to the plot not like other movies adding unnecessary bs. But I've always enjoyed the little mermaid movies. My daughter didn't like it though lol. The only negative comment I'd have to say is is that she looked a little animated while underwater but that's a given/expected.
LaMonica  L,5,"I loved the theme of accepting others and allowing your child to love others and pursue their dreams in life.  Great music, action, and overall picture imaging."
Marcus,5,I loved the music. Halle Bailey has the voice of an angel! She truly embodied the wonderment naivete of Ariel. I also loved the message at the end between Ariel and Triton. I am going to see it again!
Andi K,5,Personally I have no idea why the rating are so low. I went with my girlfriend and we both agree that (in our opinion) it is the best live remake Disney has ever made. Definitely worth going to see in theaters!
Sharon,5,It just was a feel good movie. It ended on a high note.
Momdiddy,5,Loved every second of this movie...my 4 year old granddaughter loved it too...Highly recommend seeing this version....I even cried at some points...
Jeannine G,5,"This movie was great!!!  The “remake” was perfect in all ways!  Truly, enjoyed!!!"
Lydia A,1,Really disappointed.
Keturah M,5,"This movie met ALL of my expectations! The casting was phenomenal, the acting was superb, Halle's voice is EVERYTHING!"
Christopher A,5,Fantastic remake. Did the original justice in so many ways.
Mario,5,This movie was so much fun and still true to the original. must watch!
Megan,5,It was pretty close to the original and there was some added new songs that were good. It was good for a life action remake.
Cindy M,4,Very enjoyable movie!!
Markee G.,5,"The acting, casting, & the way they executed the whole story was great for someone who wasn't sure they could pull this 1 off..the bad reviews are all wrong. If someone has a problem with it then they had a personal problem beforehand either way, because I loved it & am very excited for when it's available to own.."
Kim,5,Loved the new bits (like Scuttle's song) AND the parts that were true to original. Bailey was beautiful and that girl can sing!  Plus Prince Eric actor was great and Ursala (Melissa) did a fabulous job at being mean and scary. And always love Akwafina and Daveed!
Sandra,5,It was such a great movie. Halle Bailey was great. I really enjoyed it.
Shay,5,Movie was very good loved every minute of it

Lin Win,5,"One of the best live action remake to date.  Must see movie for sure, you won’t be disappointed!"
Tawana,5,Halle was an excellent choice for Ariel!
Traci,4,"THERE IS SOMETHING INSPIRING ABOUT SEEING A MOVIE ON THE BIG SCENE THAT YOU WONT GET AT HOME.  WE SAW THE MOVIE IN 3-D (WHICH HAS COME A LONG WAY) AND IT WAS AMAZING WHEN UNDERWATER, NOT AS AMAZING ON THE LAND SCENES.  THE SONGS ARE AMAZING ALONG WITH THE VOICES OF THE SINGERS. i WOULD GO SEE IT AGAIN."
Shanta,5,Great movie! My daughter and I enjoyed it!
Monica,5,The singing and acting were great!
Tyrag,4,"This installment was beautiful and I appreciated the inclusivity of all the mermaids. The story line was awesome as usual and the acting was amazing! It felt like a short movie but it was 2hrs. Maybe I was enjoying it too much. Halle did a wonderful job as Ariel! The crab Sebastian played by Daveed Digs was awesome and Awkwafina as Scuttle was totally hilarious. Overall, bring your kid to watch this movie. Its enjoyable for both adults and children. I laughed a lot."
Symone,5,The movie was amazing and glad I was able to come see it with my little one.
Phil,5,"Loved the entire movie.  Halle Bailey was outstanding, and the other actors were equally remarkable.  What a masterpiece!  I only went to keep my wife company, and I am looking forward to seeing it again!"
Jacob M,5,"Halle Bailey was amazingly tender, hopeful, and strong.  Definitely worth a watch to re-live this updated Disney classic and see it a new light.  Scuttle (voiced by Awkafina) had me laughing out loud in the theater.  Enjoy!"
Carrie,4,Great new version of a classic!  When taking younger kids be aware that it is over 2 hours.
Jennifer R,5,"This movie is fantastic!!! I saw it in 3D, what an experience. Do yourself a favor and go see it, take a friend or two with you. The most diverse movie of all time.  Halle Bailey showed she is a gifted singer and very talented actress."
Felicia,5,It was absolutely amazing! I enjoyed EVERY MOMENT OF IT. It captured my 3 year old daughter's attention. 5 stars for HALLE!
Mouniratou,5,"Its was a wonderful experience, very well made"
Charles B,3,"Ariel and Eric were amazing. Very long film however, could have been shortened."

Dollie,5,I like the fact that the movie had all ethnic groups of people.
Sheila L,5,We loved It. It was excellent and welll done. Everyone in the theater clapped when it was over. A must see
Leslie D,5,We were so happy to be able to enjoy this charming retelling of the classic tale. The effects were wonderful and all characters were well acted. I highly recommend it to anyone.
Beautiful you,4,"Thank for asking My favorite was the the bird the crab and the fish.
The best part was bring everyone together"
Nikki,5,It was great movie. The acting was superb. I really like all the different representations in the movie.
Traci R.,5,It was a brilliant update to my favorite Disney movie. Halle Bailey as Ariel was more than my heart could take. Melissa McCarthy as Ursula was the best cast role ever. I cant wait to see it again.
Sanjaya L,5,I really loved the new live-action version.
Fred,5,"I liked the 3D experience,  it was like I was in the movie. Review from my 8 year old granddaughter.  She can't wait to see it again."
Alicia C,5,Best Disney live-action movie to date! The casting was perfect. Daveed Diggs stole the show as Sebastian the crab. The music was outstanding - better than the original. Halle has such an incredible voice! I have nothing bad to say about this movie. It exceeded my very high expectations.
Dawn,5,Casting was beautifully done!  Live action forever!
Kram8732,5,Loved The Little Mermaid! The original animated version was my daughters favorite movie so I was familiar with the story. The live action version nailed it and also ratcheted up the emotional tension. I kept tearing up at the beauty and drama I experienced. I highly recommend this movie!
Jenica J,5,Love the fresh Caribbean focus. Hailey was phenomenal as Ariel!!
Ronald,3,"Disney needs to get back to it's roots. Screw that woke crap and the diversity crap, just tell the story and quit worrying about peoples feelings."
R1AQU2EL.C,5,Amazing film.  The musical performances were excellent.
Daniel V,3,"Soundtrack was really good, but it just felt uninspired and flat. It was nice seeing the visuals, but it's got no substance in the story."
Trish N,5,"Oh my gosh!! Little mermaid was sooooo good. I was even ""that mom"" and took my 5 month old baby. He was locked on it (then fell asleep lol). 
But really. Bravo!! The movie was great"
DME,2,"Although Halle's voice nailed it, her acting skills fell very flat! She just looked confused and scared the whole time. Skuttle's voice was extremely hard to listen to, and it's sad they completely took out the chef scene. And poor Flounder! What happened to him?? And Ariel's hair - why was it orange?? They changed the look of many characters and not for the best. 

Ursula nailed it! I can't believe Melissa McCarthy's voice could sound like that. and the makeup and special effects were all done amazingly."
Kelly D,5,"My childhood brought to life, it was an incredible refresh of the classic in live action. The CGI of the underwater world was incredible and encapsulating, with amazing performances from Halle Bailey, Melissa McCarthy and Awkwafina in roles I’m convinced they were born to play. It’s a must see!"
Kathi,4,It was a cute movie and I loved all the sea creatures and underwater scenes. The only thing I didn’t like about it was that it was a bit too long. Other ten that I enjoyed it.
david,0,Blah. Couldn’t buy in to any of the voice actors. Some things don’t need to be re done.
TomTom,5,"Awesome movie, the story line add ins were amazing and really brought the story to life!"
Natalie A,5,Me and my daughter loved the movie. She kept commenting on how beautiful Ariel was! Good casting and my 15 year old son even enjoyed it.
Roger R,5,Beautiful movie! Halle Bailey really played the role of Ariel so well. I loved every minute of the movie.
Katrina,5,I loved how they kept it as close as possible to the original movie. It was amazing.
Terri,5,My adult daughter and I went to this movie.  Little Mermaid was her favorite movie growing up.  We both LOVED this new version.  We both thought all of the actors/actresses were spot on.  Can't wait to see it again when it becomes available to stream on Disney.  We both highly recommend.
Nisha,4,The movie was beautifully made. Didn't love some of the songs.
Joy S,5,"I love a musical, so I knew I was going to love it! My granddaughters were up clapping, dancing and singing with each musical number...my heart was light with love watching them watch Ariel just be..."
Marcie M,4,"I really enjoyed the innocence of this movie. Was very pleased to see there wasnt a work agenda. I have stayed clear of Disney and its products for a couple years now, but decided to give it another chance. Disney can win back my business if it stays on this track"
James,5,"We absolutely loved the new live action version of The Little Mermaid.  It was our daughter's first time seeing a movie in an actual theater.  She was captivated the entire time and has been asking to listen to the sound track non-stop ever since!

I think this was by far the best live action adaptation of an animated Disney film.  The cast selection was on amazing and Halle Lynn Bailey was outstanding as the titular character.  Her voice and performance were enchanting.

I can't recommend this movie enough!"
True Little Mermaid Fan,5,Excellent… Beautifully done. Loved the new songs
Dawn C,5,"I felt all the emotions that are typically missing from the animated version.
It was great!
I plan to watch it a few more times. It was that good!"

John Henny,5,A really great movie with great singing and acting
Nandi,5,"Great graphics, great music, great story, beautiful mermaids and funny crustaceans"
rayne.chi,5,"Beautiful imagery & suspenseful even if you've seen the cartoon version, it's sill thrilling."
Facebook U,3,The cartoon was better
priscilla Lattimore,5,The MOVIE was EXCEPTIONAL!! BUT THE THEATER WERE FREEZING  EVERYONE IN THERE COMPLAINED HOW COLD IT WERE
Taylor,5,Halle Bailey was the perfect choice for Ariel! A true Mermaid Princess!
Sara,5,I have always loved the cartoon and so have my Granddaughters. To bring it to life madecit even more special. The graphics were so realistic. I definitely recommend the 3D version.
TT,1,I really wanted to like it.
T. R.,5,"This movie was amazing, the kids loved it!"
rhoda r,5,It mirrored the animated version which we loved. The new songs were great.
Disney Fan,4,"Love that it stayed true to the original, just a bit long - probably could have cut some of the extra songs."
Jaziblu,5,Great and cute movie.
amber,5,I thought it was an exciting movie. The characters were very well portrayed. Alot more action than the original cartoon. Love it.
Angel B.,5,So good! Great performances from Halle Bailey and Melissa McCarthy! A Definite must see if you loved the little mermaid growing up!
Joanne,4,"Great to see this live action remake of a cartoon classic, featuring a diverse cast. For a parent, the underwater scenes are like a trip to the spa - very relaxing and beautiful."
Krys C,5,Loved everyone but Sebastian really.
Dan,4,"It was fun to reminisce about fun memories of the original. We took the whole family. Everyone had a good time, teens to children."
Sav,4,Cinematically were great. Kept all classic songs with a few new added in .
Larry,5,"I really loved the fact Disney did not change the storyline too much the graphics were very cool the music, the actors and It had its funny parts as well. I remember seeing the Little Mermaid in the morning before school when i was younger, and to see it now as an adult as a movie with the kids made me feel like the kid again."
Miami,5,"Loved the actors, happy Disney stuck to the original storyline, visuals were stunning, and the music was beautiful!"
Boy mom,5,My boys and I loved this movie! It was entertaining and beautifully made.
danielle,3,The voice was not as good as the original. Ursula was fantastic. The pigeon voice was very annoying.
Courtney,5,black girl magic my daughters loved to see someone like them as a mermaid as Ariel weve always seen her as white girl with red hair but to see brown skin and locs(with a boho style) was everything BLACK GIRLS ROCK!!
Khiley,5,"AMAZING!!!!!!! Loved every minute of it! The only thing I wasn't satisfied with, was Flounder did not look like Flounder. Other than that, it was perfect!"
Annap84,4,Very good overall - but some lines from original omitted
Brenda,5,"I loved this movie! Surprise beginning, Surprise endings  Although the storyline is basically the same storyline as the animation version, there is so much more visual affects that adults will appreciate. I’m not sure how much the pre K age would tolerate this movie. The length may lose the pre K’s attention. The family seated next to me had 3 children. Dad and 2 of the children did fine but the youngest ((maybe about 5 or 6) talked and fidgeted, made her mother leave the movie twice, and finally wanted to sit on her mothers lap who was sitting next to me. There is no way Mom enjoyed this movie. She would of been better off going to the movie arcade instead of disrupting everyone around her. She was very apologetic and polite so I don’t fault her for her taking care a her daughter. But it was distracting as I was on the end seat and they had to get out by me every time. This movie is made for the whole family including parents to enjoy. No profanity, no nudity, just sweet music everyone recognizes and a feel good feeling. I originally was to see it in IMAX and 3d but that theatre system was down so had to se the movie the traditional way. If you have the choice for IMAX or 3d. Choose one of those options. I feel the special affects would have been spectacular."
IJ,5,if you grew up watching original animated Disney films you will love this life action version of The Little Mermaid. I feel like they stay true to what made this movie so amazing to me as a kid. Wonderful acting and even more wonderful singing!
Kathy,5,CGI was amazing! Both grandkids loved it and my daughter and I loved it too. There were some intense moments so I wouldnt recommend for kids under 4 or those who are very sensitive. It did run long for a kids movie-ours had to take a bathroom break.
itsCamai,5,"I was honestly skeptical of this live action film, but it felt so close to the original — and better! The graphics were AMAZING and the actors casted were perfect. The length was just right. Overall it exceed my expectations. 5 stars!"
Cassandra,4,"I liked that Movie follows the org story line. 
I didnt like them changing the main character I think they should have made her look like the org Ariel"
Stephanie vieira,5,"Beautiful movie. The music, costumes and actors did amazing."
Paul,3,Casting and acting was awful.
Chucktowngirl,2,"Bad acting, too politically correct"
Karen,5,"I loved the Little Mermaid. The acting was subtle, not overdone, the singing was excellent and the settings were beautiful, especially the under water scenes. Well done."
Nelson,4,"The Little Mermaid remake was a enjoyable movie, with great music and beautiful visuals. However, the presence of young children in the row in front of me were talking and fidgeting throughout the film which became a distraction. Overall, I would recommend the movie to fans of the original, but I would advise parents to choose a earlier showing if they are bringing young children."
Senora,4,"Some parts of the movie was very entertaining, the singing was awesome.  Movie felt longer than expected."
Ebone,5,"I love the mix of ethnicities and Halle was literally perfect for that role. It was the perfect reenactment of the original.  All the actors were amazing.  Melissa Mccarthy is good in EVERY role she has ever played. The actor that played Eric was perfect. It was all so perfect.  I really enjoyed,  so much! Bravo to the team that put it all together!"
Jenise  R,5,The sing arrangements were better than ever
Morgan,5,"It's was amazing, especially in 3D. I love how they brought in a variety of nationalities and have it a new twist and look. Ariel a.k.a. Halle Bailey has the most amazing angelic voice, just beautiful."
Patricia Yancey,5,"Mesmerizing visuals and beautiful talent Halle is a spectacular actress. The cast was amazing and multicultural. My 4 year danced and sang , this was our second time watching this movie. We loved it so much"
"Angelique (Charlotte, NC)",5,"What a wonderfully fresh and artful way to tell an old story. Halles performance as Ariel was wonderful - she was beautiful, so darn cute and she nailed both the innocence and determination of the character. And her vocals - oh my goodness just flawless like an Angel!! There was humor, the music made me dance in my chair, the animation was phenomenal. Ursula was exactly as I remembered her. I could literally go on and on. Fantastic job to all involved in the production of the new Little Mermaid!"
Lisa F,4,"They are missing key music such as a good version of Fathoms below, daughters of Triton, and Les Poissons. I didn't mind the new additions, but missing those songs really disappointed me. The movie was fun, though the story line did not feel as fluid as the original. 

Sometimes you just shouldn't mess with the classics."
Danielle,5,Surprisingly enjoyable movie! Lots of diversity in this!
Rosalyn,5,Beautiful and true to story
Denise D,5,"I didnt know what to expect going in. I really enjoy the movie. This was a great remake. Disney did a great job with inclusion, I was pleasantly surprised."
Anne,4,Production of the movie was very well done. Enjoyed the entire thing.
Steve,1,I felt it didn't compare to the original animated one..
LV,1,Worth watching for Melissa. That’s all.
steve,4,"I saw no difference between the last movie , im disappointed GMA AND DISNEY made it a black and white thing.
The cinematic etc were very good, and Ursula stole the show!!"
Emanuel,5,"Movie was great, it was enjoyable, and Halle gave an amazing performance. Her singing was stellar and would definitely watch again. I will admit, some CGI parts were a little iffy, but it doesn't derail from the whole experience."
Raven,5,Honestly it was an great movie. Simpler like the first but yet different. It's an movie for all kids not just little girls. As an adult I enjoyed it also.
Sidney,5,Great movie for kids
AshBear,4,"Only thing missing that I was so looking forward to was the chef scene. Its been one of my favorites since I was almost 2. Chef Louie singing Les poissons, followed by the chase would have been a great scene. Alas we got a high school musical version of Eric singing to the ocean"
nakmuay,2,"The acting is not so great, and the story is a bit plain. I know that they followed the original one, but since it's a live action, they should adapt it to be realistic. I didn't see how Ariel got to be in love with the prince during the boat scene, which led her to save him, then chose him over her own dad. And the number scenes were kinda awkward for me, the acting didn't sync with the animation. lastly, I wished they could have done better with Ariel's costumes when she was on the land. Her outfit didn't suit her, and she had been wearing the same outfit for 3 days in the movie! (Even though her got wet from falling off the boat scene)"
Tiffany  J,5,"Excellent movie, heartwarming movie even for adults"
Antoinette,5,"Loved the music, storyline, acting, cinematography ! It was FANTASTIC!"
cathy w,4,"Great live action adaptation of cartoon, really enjoyed the new songs."
Cassandra B,5,"epic remake, killer soundtrack. must see im XD!!"
Abe,5,"Vivid visuals best seen in 3D. Successful upgrade from animation to live animation, with a couple new songs that fit perfectly into the original storyline, with intelligent updates to the script and lyrics. Talented (and beautiful) actors, voice actors, rendering and direction. Both"
Shawna,5,Super cute loved the mix up of the movie different parts
Torie C-C,5,Sad about a song that was taken out from the original but love the ones they added in.
Nancy A,5,I absolutely loved it! The visuals were fantastic too. Loves the little twist given to some events.
Sam,5,Much better than Mulan
UNC,5,"Great movie, with great people. Must see movie."
Daniel M,4,Halle is phenomenal and her voice is incredible! A couple of extra songs they added kind of felt like filler. But overall great adaptation.
Scherrie,5,"Please do not read some of the fake reviews. Many are upset because Halle is playing Ariel- racism still exists! Anyway, this movie is great! I loved everyone in the movie. Melissa McCarthy is wonderful, Halle’s voice is amazing, the young  man that played Prince Eric is just amazing- I loved it all! I want to see it again. It is so cute,  has some funny moments and just… great as the original! For real, go check it out for yourself!"
Joe F,3,"After years of waiting for this film to be realized with millions of others. There were some great portions and aweful choices made in this film. I cant say too much without ruining it. For the most part it hits all the marks, but so many little things could have skyrocketed this film to its true full glory in the heavens! Simple fix: why o why couldnt Sebastian and other cast go up and down in thier voice and add some life to a very real looking creature. It was all monotone and one note! Like if they were speaking even while breaking into song! There was no inflections or nuances that made us laugh and fall in love with them like the animated movie. At this point its all fantasy looking real as possible but that doesnt mean take the simple magic and warmth away. Also the PACE of the film is too rushed for me! Why did it feel like a barely 1 hour movie!? The movie was a bit over 2hours but it went by super super fast! It was wayy too fast paced for me. There needed to be a bit more time in the big singing numbers: part of your world should have been bit longer, poor unfortunate souls, and under the sea needed all some extra zest it was too bland. Melissa McCarthy plays Melissa McCarthy dressed up as rsula she needed to eat up and truly be RSULA yes the villain we know and love. But she gave a lack luster performance and played herself, again. And I LOVE Melissa, but for a film this gargantuan its no time for games we needed rsulax1000 nothing less. At times I thought she sounded drunk! I liked the wallowing in misery parts, subtle things she did. When it came to give it her all she held back some so that balance was off. Then the entire movie seemed to try hard to balance real effects with fantasy effects in the cgi world. Please with how much money Disney has they EASILY could have balance better. Scenes were just way too clean and tidy underwater! Its the ocean not a perfect crystal clear float around the air village. It was missing its grandeur! That the original had. The underwater scenes needed more grit and dust to look real. That would of helped the cgi, it would of been an easy and great fix to make fans truly feel they are in the real ocean. And tons of issues with costumes. Thats a whole diff review. Overall fun to watch and was a good story they just missed so many marks that could of easily been fixed. Enjoy."
Robert L,5,"Loved everything about this movie.  The music, acting, cinematography all first rate. A very entertaining and moving story."
Tamula,5,"Must see, great movie indeed."
LATEESHA,5,Beautiful film for all ages!
Angela L,5,"Halle was the perfect Ariel. At first I was against the casting, but then I saw her in the live action & it completely changed my mind. Beautiful voice, great acting, perfect Ariel."
Abhishek,5,Great starcast and presentation. Very engaging.
Faye S,5,"Loved it. The intensity and beauty of the underwater scenes are absolutely amazing and this was not the 3D version. Also, the soundtrack is wonderful. While I have never seen the animated version I recall hearing that there were some violent scenes. The live version is packed with action and perils."
Sofia,5,"Great visual effects, casting. A tinely remake ot a classic. Halle Bailey is a beautiful star with voice of an angel!"
Sofia S,5,"This live action remake was phenomenal. The original movie was my childhood all-time favorite and I really believe that this did it justice. Halle’s voice was truly made for Ariel I don’t think they could have picked a better actress/singer! There were so many aspects of the movie that gave me nostalgia as they were just like the original, but there were also many new ones that I thoroughly enjoyed. I really liked getting to see more of the connection between Ariel and Eric since we didn’t get too much of that in the original. I also love that Jodi was in the live action! I would absolutely go see it again!!"
Brad,5,"It was incredible, we watched in IMAX 2D and it was an experience I highly recommend to everyone, especially those who have their doubts about this movie. Disney succeeded in bringing this story to life in the 21st century. The casting was phenomenal and the off screen crew made the entire movie amazing down to the last detail. The realism is a shock factor initially but once you let go, it’s incredible what they’ve done when you pay attention to the details. Halle Bailey was the perfect choice for this role and it’s heartbreaking that people can’t see past the skin tone of the characters from the original animation and just embrace and enjoy the film for what it is - a modern and inclusive adaptation to a classic Disney Movie. It was truly a magical moment watching all the young black girls dressed up in the theater excited for the movie, and I can only imagine the feeling their mothers (and fathers) had. I felt an overwhelming amount of emotions during this movie because of how beautiful and seen people feel from watching this, including myself. - To anyone who may be upset by their choice of casting, please reflect on why you feel so much resistance to something so insignificant for your life but which is actually very beautiful and powerful, especially for so many people. -  Disney did a phenomenal job of taking the story of Ariel and bringing the details full circle. Instead of simply focusing on another basic love story, we actually get to see Ariel’s personality and individuality a bit more, as well as Eric’s. We now have a clear story of their falling in love, as well as the emotional dynamics of everything as the story unfolds. As much as it is a “scene for scene remake” at some points of the movie, it is also a deeper dive into the story but with beautiful aesthetics, scenery, videography, and a fairly altered story line as well. There are a few parts in the movie that I would have personally changed but nothing that altered my perception of the movie overall. The ending of this movie was breathtakingly emotional especially for anyone who has felt in their life that they can’t be who they are or follow their hearts - without the risk of feeling like they will be renounced by those around them. You just won’t get that level of emotion from the original movie and that’s one of the reasons why this movie is so amazing and powerful - and why people who are upset about the differences should “let go of their idea of what it should be, and just let it be” - and watch how beautiful it really is. If that’s you, I assure you, it won’t disappoint and hopefully you can see why it’s so important this role is played by Halle."
NK,5,"The whole family really enjoyed it!!! This movie was one of the best adaptation movies Disney has ever made and of all time!!!!!! This version of the movie had so much more depth, substance, and relevance for our times. It was truly authentic and had very high quality acting from a great and diverse cast. Thanks Disney!!"
S,5,the BEST movie i’ve watched in such a long time. made my heart so happy & cried at the end
Natasha Simpkins,5,The BEST remake every. I had to hold bk tears. Loved
Skhy,5,A+ Congratulations!!
Amy,5,I took my daughters (ages 14 and 9) to see this today.  They loved it and don't have a ton of exposure to the original. I was a young teen when the original movie came out and this was such a joy to watch with my kids.  I just have one complaint -- Lin: How could you take out Les Poissons for that super cheese Prince Eric number? But Daveed Diggs as Sebastian was a stroke of brilliance.
Kesh R,5,We loved the entire film
Tim,3,I loved the first couple of songs they really reminded me of growing up watching the little mermaid say what you want but I'm a grown man that will sit and watch this movie again. Great family movie.
Silver Surfer,5,Beautiful. Magical. Halle Bailey did such an amazing job in this movie!!!
Kimberly,5,Loved it. Ariel was perfect. The music was great and it was refreshing to see the different mermaids.
Lorna,5,I really enjoyed the movie. Beautiful ending
Sandi,5,So far the best live action Disneys done
Danielle,5,Best made live action Disney!!!
Kenya,5,Loved everything about this film!
Sydney,5,Absolutely amazing I cried 3 times
Bridget T,5,The music was fantastic and I loved the inclusivity.
Stan,5,"Absolutely wonderful 🙌✨ I felt emotions while watching, Halle Bailey is SUCH A GREAT SINGER 🧜‍♀️                                               UNDER THE SEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA"
Michael,5,It was incredible through and through. Beautifully done.
Danielle,5,"I love how they kept it similar to the original movie with some fun add ons. Music, costumes and graphics were on point. Definitely recommend!"
Ernestina,4,I thought it was much better than the animated movie back in 1989. The effects were very well done especially Ursala's movements. I just didn't care much for the actress that played Ariel. Her performance was okay but she just doesn't come across as an Ariel. Still I would see it again.
Eva,2,"In the land of live action Disney remakes, this is not the worst. I would say 6.5 out of 10, which in these remakes is actually a good score. The Little Mermaid is my favorite and so I went into this critical. Dont go into it critical, go in open minded, its not a bad movie. Ive seen in multiple times now haha. This stays pretty true to the 1989 classic, with some additions from the Hans Christian Anderson fairy tale that it was adapted from, as well as some traditional Mermaid folklore. If you love the Dark tragic fairy tale, you will like this, if you love the 1989 Disney version, you will love this, if you love mermaid storys you will like this. New songs are just meh. I like Erics song, and the additional reprise to part of your world, which made me cry. This film is fun, its beautiful and Halle Bailey incase anyone was worried, is Ariel. Shes almost perfect, the same goes for most of this cast. Working with a subpar script holds them back. Ariel and Erics chemistry is magical and romantic and Im so glad its been added on to. Where this film fails is everywhere they attempted to make it modern or change things. If something is broke, dont fix it Disney!"
Danny F,5,The cast were fantastic ! The songs brought some nostalgia with a twist! Love every minute of it!!
Rosa,5,I loved everything about it!
Alta,4,I loved the movie very funny exciting. It took me back to my childhood the little mermaid is my favorite movie.
Dianne,5,Great family movie! The adults enjoyed the movie as much as the kids!
Tanya,5,"This movie did not disappoint!  It was charming and witty. The music and story stayed true to the original cartoon version my family loves. Halle Bailey, Melissa McCarthy, and Daveed Diggs as Sebastian were my favorites."
Sakinah W,5,Absolutely loved it. Best Disney remake of all.
Pkc,4,Very much like the original. Loved it. Brought back memories. The theatre played the sound too loud or I would have given it 5 stars.
Natasha B,5,It was excellent!!!!!
Crystal F,5,The movie was awesome
Fatima d,5,This was phenomenal! I can’t wait to watch it again!!
Ray,5,Amazing music and performances!  Wonderful multi-ethnic cast!
Lisa,5,Absolutely fabulous movie!!!!
Caitlin C,5,"Quite possibly the best Disney live-action adaptation to date. Halle Bailey is the perfect Ariel even when she can't speak, she is so emotive and you can really feel everything she is going through. Plus, her voice is absolutely beautiful. The updated storyline adds more depth to Ariel and Eric's relationship, and I love the new songs. The underwater world is so colorful and so beautifully done. All around a wonderful movie that is both fun and heartfelt."
Diana T,4,Sweet new song by the prince and Ursula was perfectly cast. Same story with fun new scenes.
Alexia,4,An enjoyable experience that breaths new life into an old favorite. I enjoyed it very much and look forward to purchasing it on DVD.
Tia,5,Absolutely loved the movie! One of my favorites!
Terry,5,Great movie. Special effects were wonderful. Loved it!
Reece,5,"had low expectations because of all the disappointing live action remakes lately, but was absolutely enchanted by this movie. wonderful performances by the vast majority of the cast, charming renditions of classic songs, just a beautiful, wonderful experience overall."
Patrice,5,WE ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT BRAVO!
Naomi,5,I loved this adaptation.  So happyy kid got to experience it in 3D.  I still felt as filled with emotions as I did in 1989 when I saw the original.  Thanks Disney!
Randy Caldwell,5,"Movie was incredible, didn't expect it to be so right on with the original but I was shocked at how perfect it was. People can say what they want but at the end of the day this movie was very moving and it reminded me so much of the original yet still being its own twist."
TK1,5,Amazing!! Loved it!!
David T,4,"It was a nice remake, plenty of surprises in the soundtrack. I liked it a lot. I was entertained."
Angel,5,I loveeeee it!!! Made me cry at the end.

Lex,5,Cast was great! Halles voice sounded so good and she embodied the character so well. Gave me the nostalgia I wanted but had enough of a fresh take on the story to not feel like a lesser copy of the original. Visually beautiful as well.

Teresa J,5,"This movie brought back memories of watching the original. It was just like the original except for live action, cgi and different people playing the characters.

Marina,5,Absolutely LOVED IT! Thank you Disney!
Daniel,5,Ariel was mesmerizing! Beautifully redone!
amber,4,"The length of the movie was a bit long for small kids there was collective antsyness around the 1hr mark in my theater. Overall the movie was diverse, the music and lyrics were clear and witty, and the animal characters (sebestain and flounder) were spot on. The main actress was phenomenal. The movie did a great job of being more up to date but also capturing the essence of the original film. More diversity in films is needed!"
Google,5,"was amazing, my family saw it twice opening weekend! Halle Bailey is gorgeous and her voice gave me goosebumps.10/10 recommend"
Isis,5,It was amazing absolutely loved every minute of it. I was moved to tears multiple times.

Jamie,4,3D version was great!  Was happy they stayed pretty close to the original version with a few tweaks. Newly added songs were ok. Loved the casting!
Camila,3,"I never got my WOW moment. Flounder and Sebastian could have been better. The cast was actually not bad but overall I just didnt get that moment of wow. And the splash on the rock part, ya that was a big let down. Good attempt but I did not enjoy the movie like the original."
Sonya,5,"It was a wonderful movie. Hallie Bailey acting was amazing.  Her acting debut was flawless. She was the most beautiful mermaid ever.

The diverse multi culture cast was endearing and warming to see. I was really intrigued by the reflection of the embodiment of society.  The inclusion of all. More importantly the kids get to see themselves in many roles. Hats off to Disney for this display of inclusion. We need more representation of all."
Luke StackWalker,5,"Well, they might as well cancel the Oscars TheLittleMermaid2023 is gonna win dang near all of them! LMM ""might"" take home one for Scuttlebutt, and best score probably isn't in the cards, but pretty much everything else should go to TLM.

Even the sound editing is off the hook! Subtle little shifts in sound follow the action as if it were live. The voices and singing are phenomenal.

Cinematography is amazing. GCI and humans are interchangeable the images are so good!

And, the story has a very fine moral woven into the wonderful songs and images!

Swim as fast as your merperson flippers will take you to see TLM in a full immersion setting like RCXtreme or IMAX!"
Josephine,4,Absolutely loved it My daughter and I enjoyed it
Latosha,5,Movie was amazing from beginning to end.  Great cast.

Enetria,5,Love love loved it!!! What more can I say!!!
Amy,5,"So good! Some scenes were different, there were only two that I minded. They were at the end. But overall, excellent movie!"
.,3,Halle was really great she has a perfect voice. Melissa Mccarthy was amazing as Ursula she blew the movie away. But some of the movie just didn't feel like little mermaid. With some casting choices we're awful with some. Didn't care for scuttle at all. I would put 100% but scuttle didn't really do it justice
Becka,5,I cant say enough about how great this film was. My 3 year old loved it and found only like one part scary. Perfect way to spend the day with her and her 12 year old cousin.
jnazario,3,"I loved the movie! I wish it included one of my favorite scenes from the original, but overall the movie was spectacular"

Donna C,5,"It was amazing!! Watched it in 3D. The actors, producers, directors and everyone with a part in the production did an outstanding job!!"

Rhonda,5,"Excellent movie, I really enjoyed the entire movie."
Tanya,5,So beautiful! I loved it. I would say maybe better for teens or adults.
Cindy,5,awesome movie for children and adults!!
B. Machi,4,"I really enjoyed this remake. Ursula was great, Ariel was a good cast. I was kinda disappointed in Sebastian... didn't seem as lively as in the cartoon movie.  Spoiler alert  I'm not sure how I feel about the ending being tweaked a little bit... it's cool they made Ariel the hero, but she saved Eric's life in the beginning, not sure why they  changed that ending part so she saved him again. Like I said I'm not sure how I feel about it... not a bad change but not sure why they had to do it. 
Otherwise it was a good remake of the movie, my daughter, her friend and I enjoyed it."
TONYA  W,4,Great movie. I put a point off because Daveed Diggs played Sebastian. It would have been better if an authentic Jamaican style actor played Sebastian. Why him?
Peggy,4,Halley Bailey did a great job as Ariel. The added songs by Erik didnt seem to fit. Missed Sebastians songs but liked how they tried to make it more realistic. Great movie overall!
Avaleen,5,Awesome remake of a beautiful classic . Ive loved the little mermaid since I was a little girl and seeing her come alive was wonderful perfect they kept all of the critical elements of the movie and added important. Cultural components to send a strong message of hope. May we embrace the lesson a little of the importance of celebrating our differences. Its the only way were going to survive and thrive.
Betsy C,5,loved it and the music
Alexys M,5,This movie was so adorable! I loved it. I wish there was a victory dress but nevertheless it was great and I had a great time watching this!
Rondell,5,Halle Bailey is fine. The end of my review
Mechell C,5,AWESOMENESS AWESOMENESS AWESOMENESS All RACES unified like AMERICA is supposed to be!!!
Jeni,4,All in all very good. A few scenes where half in and half out of the water looked a little weird. But we all enjoyed it very much. Ariel did an great job.
TW,5,Loved this movie 🧜🏿‍♀️
PR,5,The beautiful scenery and big screen
yamel,0,Worst movie ever from Disney. The costumes and special effects are a shame. What was the budget for this movie? I can’t mention all the details I’m disappointing about. Reading all the reviews are not even enough. You have to see it for your self. It’s terrible
Diane,4,"I liked the main actors very much but felt that the orchestral music, although fabulous, somewhat overshadowed/overpowered the exquisite vocals.  The balance could have been better.  I also thought the storylines darker themes were carried out a bit longer and more violent than necessary."
Kara S,5,The cast was wonderful and their voices were fabulous!  Our daughter loved it and she is 4 years old and sat through the movie completely interested through it all!
Anna S,5,Absolutely loved it! Great music
The Simpsons,5,This is a great remake of a Disney classic. The new Ariel is fabulous and the music cant be beat! Definitely a must see. I will say that it may be a tad long for the little ones but otherwise its great.
Michael,4,Much better than expected.  I'm not a fan of all the Disney remakes.  However this movie is definitely worth seeing and stands on it's own merit.
Miriam G,0,Watched this with my 19 year old. I used to sing the Ariel song to her when she was a baby.  The movie is beautiful and the nostalgia was so strong we both cried even in the parts you’re not meant to cry in. Loved all the new scenes and new songs too. We both loved it so much!
Sofia,5,Excellent! Loved everything about it! From the cast to the singing to the movie itself!
Cody A,2,"Wasn’t for her singing or Melissa stealing the show as Ursula, it would’ve been boring. It had its moments, but drew me away several times."
LtTawnyMadison,4,"This is definitely the best of the live action remakes. I could be biased though, because TLM 89 is my favorite Disney movie. But it really was wonderfully done in my opinion, and the casting for Ariel, Eric and Ursula was perfect. However, just like all the remakes, even though it was great, it still was just unnecessary. I can get just as much or more out of watching the original even though there were some delightful new things in the live action."
Mallory,5,Love how true it stayed to the Disney but also still had its own flair. Fantastic acting from an incredible cast! Love the actress who plays Ariel!
Ayesha,5,Loved it. Saw it twice.
Cody S,5,"I thought it was an amazing adaptation. the music was incredible, the scenery below the water and on land was very magical and took me back to my childhood. I'll definitely watch it again and again! Halle Bailey was the perfect choice for Ariel!"
Andrea,5,Riveting & bright!!  Exciting & fun!!  Every age group and every human was having a blast!!
Karen Harty,5,Liked the whole movie

Janay,5,I saw it twice in one weekend! It was absolutely beautiful
Wanda R,5,"Singing was amazing, and I loved the Cast!!"
Arsilia,5,"It was such a good movie, we all enjoyed it very much. The characters were awesome."
MAC,3,"Too long. Didnt like the way the characters of Sebastian, Scuttle and Flounder were reimagined, not as likeable. Halle Bailey and Melissa McCarthy did a good job. Tried too hard to be inclusive and ethically diverse. Cant  we be true to a Danish fairy tale. So much for cultural literacy."
Dianne,4,"It was a little too long but was good. Movie theater we went to, AMC 5th St Wyomissing, PA is filthy. They need to close this location or make changes. I wont ever go back"
RP,3,"It is a good remake, but not fantastic. A bit boring at times, but worth watching once. The sea gull and Ariel herself are amazing. I liked the original sea witch and Sebastian way better. They have completely deleted Sebastian’s kitchen scene. The music is fun."
Scuttlina,5,"Eric was using too much of his acting, but Ursula used JUST ENOUGH!!! Sea Witch for President!"
Nick,5,Beautiful adaptation. A star is born!
Rachel L,5,It’s giving all the nostalgia with a dash of extra seasoning. Love!
Angel Martinez Sanchez,5,"I loved the changes to the story, the main actress was phenomenal, I loved the ending."
Dee,5,Movie was phenomenal
Linda,5,The move was engaging and family friendly.
Arlene A,2,"The movie was delightful, but the theater was dirty, noisy and, of course, the concession is a huge ripoff."
Me,3,It was ok. Music was good! Wish it was more authentic to the original
STAFFORD,5,Refreshing good movie for the whole  family
Isabella,5,"This movie is art. It teaches people everywhere about love and their value of their voices. Its beautifully done, and Im planning on seeing it again this week. Its a must see."
Rafaela,5,The movie its really great and has a good picture
paul m,0,No plot  kinda boring
Jessica,4,A wonderful nod to the original with its own new and exciting take!
Rebecca P,5,AMAZING!! 10/10 Loved the new songs and Halle and the rest of the cast were great!
pdm,5,"If you love the original animated movie, you will live this one, especially in 3D."
Tbird,5,It was a great movie! Its almost better than the original!
Luis,2,"It was not bad at all, but the slow parts where a bit rocky but that’s a live action compared to a cartoon. Not bad though"
Michelle,0,"It was alright, nothing to rave over"
Michelle,5,The movie was amazing! The casting was perfect.
PJ,5,Amazing. Even for a bit teary eyed at the end.
CH,4,Great movie for a younger audience.
Michele,5,I thought that it was a wonderful movie

Shark and Miley,5,Wonderful retelling of a classic! The visuals and vocals are beautiful!!! We had a great time!!
laura,5,Halle Bailey was incredible as Ariel. I am a fan of the animated film since childhood and I really enjoyed this interpretation. My biggest complaint is that Chef Louis was not reimagined in this live action version. I like the additional development of Eric's character. I think the film was perfectly cast - everyone was amazing!!
monte,5,This was beautiful. Halle’s voice was captivating
Patrice,5,So awesome. I am 34 years old and I always love little mermaid. It just made my little childhood come to life.

Alisa D,5,Really well done with a few added touches to make the story even better.

Nekita,5,"I honestly had low expectations from this movie, but I loved it. It kept my attention from start to finish. Melissa stole the show in this movie I really wanted to see more of her."
Google,5,I liked the realness and the way the emotions were depicted!!

S.....,1,Generally not good. Disappointing for Disney
Kerri,4,Great story line with a few changes to the original. Wasnt a fan of the additional music.
Rayan,5,"First of all, Halle is awesome! Next, I really like how they stuck to the Caribbean theme. It made sense with the marine life and Sebastian's accent. It also made me feel warm, watching something that reminds me of my West Indian culture."
Evan F,5,daughter and wife loved it
Renee,5,It was a fabulous remake of the original.
LORRAINE J,5,Beautiful movie! Halle has a beautiful voice. Awesome job!

I wasnt a huge fan of Scuttles song, but I enjoyed the other new additions. I cried because it made me feel like a kid again."
sinmadree,5,Fantastic movie! Loved the ending!

Shawlee  B,5,So Amazing!!! Laughed & Cried. They did amazing!! Everyone & Everything was amazing.
Tyheem,5,I liked it better than the cartoon version

Kim C,5,"Really enjoyed this movie! New additions to a classic! A must see. Can be scary for a little kids, so I would recommend it for ages five and up."
Ray F,4,I liked the music and the story. But they didn’t need to kill King Triton towards the end.
Sree,5,Visually magnificent! Halle Bailey's voice is like hot cocoa with marshmallow on a snowy night. All the songs were beautiful including the new ones. Can't the tune of Under the sea out of my head :)
Rosenda,5,Loved the movie   just as good as the Disney movie in 93  it was mine and my daughters favorite movie . Shes now 32

Lillian,5,Halle Bailey did an awesome job. Halles's singing was excellent. Melissa Mccarthy was excellent.  the whole movie was just great.
William,3,If I didn’t know the original storyline it would have been better. I’m all for remakes but this one was a bit jolting although entertaining.
Melissa,5,Super cute movie. Better than I expected.
Christina R,5,True enough to the cartoon but with a modern and updated vibe!!
LaRhonda D,5,I like everything about the movie
Miranda,5,"I really liked that a lot of brand new scenes and songs were included along with the original story elements of the first.  It made the ""love story"" more believable because there was actual chemistry that built instead of just enchantment."
Robert J,5,"The movie was really good, I missed the chef song, but my 10-year-old daughter really liked it. For people that are complaining it's a movie based on a cartoon from some 30+ years ago of course it's different, but who cares it was a good adventure for the kids..."

Matresa Mason,4,The music and graphics were awesome

Kelsey,5,Amazing cast. Halle’s voice is beautiful. Great new songs written by Lin Manuel
Google,1,"Was just not like the original. Couldve picked a better lead for Ariel and flounder, Sebastian and scuttle were even more disappointing the Ariel. Disney couldve done way better. Another original movie ruined by the live make."
Meeca,5,It was true to the original.  Hailey has a beautiful voice. And I love the diverse cast.  Wonderful job.

ShonnaP,5,The movie was fantastic. It  was inclusive for everyone. It was great for my grandchildren to see people who looked like them.
Comet,5,The essence of the little mermaid is heightened. The mystery surrounding what happened 15 years ago to Ariel’s mom and Eric’s parents has me yearning for a sequel!!!
Michele,4,It was cute and followed the traditional story. The clever Disney connection of worlds was well done.
Will W,5,Enjoyed it immensely. Recommend to see at least once.
OrchidNoir,5,Fun and cinematic. So glad I listened to the negative reviews and saw for myself.
gma l,5,Took my 9 year old grandchild to see it---was wonderful. They added a couple of new songs but thought they were very inventive with the original songs too. Ursula may be a little too scary for really young kids.
Pamela,5,"I loved the actors, the storyline, the music, and it was long enough!"
Tiffany M,5,"Such a cute and immersive live action version of the animated movie I grew up with. Halle Bailey and Jonah Hauer-King have awesome chemistry. And Halle did an amazing job carrying the film as a lead. And her voice! My goodness…had me in tears during Part of Your World. I really enjoyed this movie and they did a great job balancing what I grew up on with some modern tweaks for today. I was absolutely charmed by this movie. The CGI was lacking in some areas but the cast did well enough that it didn’t take me out of the experience. All around, I give it a thumbs up!"
Lola,5,"I loved this movie!! Will go see it again. Again, and again!!!"

Yo,5,"The movie was good, just like the original."
Eliana P,5,Lovely production very close to the original
Cheryl,5,"LOVED this movie!  When my daughter was little, she watched the animated movie over and over.  Loved seeing this with her and remembering all we loved about the movie.  Great effects!  I wouldnt recommend the movie for any child under 6 because of some of the intense parts."
JC,5,Halle Bailey gives a soul-filling performance throughout the entire film that one can't deny is just simply stunning. Melissa McCarthy didn't disappoint with her version of Ursula. Such a fun movie - see it in a theater!
Robin,5,Loved the movie except for the part with Prince Eric singing: that was a bit much. Everything else was fantastic from the stunning under sea visual effects to the beautiful diverse cast. It's also funny that the people who claim to hate this movie (and we all know why) were still in the theaters.
Facebook U,4,100% loved it !!! Love that there was very little change from the original !!
Tara,5,Great for the whole family!  We loved everything about it.  Disney got it right again

Kenya M,5,"Loved, loved, loved it!   Halle was born to play Ariel!!! My family truly enjoyed the movie"
jordan,5,"I loved the changes they made to the storyline, so the small changes they made to storyline helped the overall story. The music was great, I even liked the scuttlebutt song. The only think I did not like was the animation, but overall it was great.  I loved the little mermaid movie when I was younger and Chloe’s (little mermaid) gave me chills for part of your world like she. I was younger."
Karen L,4,I thought it was a really great adaptation of the original. It was only missing one favorite line! lol
Natasha,5,Great modern day twist to a classic
Deborah D,5,"Beautifully done! The stars, music and cinematography were so fantastic! I loved it!"
Lily,5,The main character stole my heart with her singing and expressive beauty. The chemistry between the two lead actors was enchanting. The cinematography was beautiful.
David,3,"Far from beating the original but still enjoyable to watch with family.  I didn't really feel the Ariel and Eric connection.  They tried to build it up but ended up flat. McCarthy had a great voice for Ursala but I think her face was too recognizable and not evil looking. I think she could've used more evil make up or something.  Triton was great sounding and looking.  Otherwise, beautiful underwater entertainment during ""Under the Sea"" song."
Irene Rovira Bradley,4,"I was waiting for my favorite scene was the meal part where she used the fork- dingle hopper,  on her hair but it was changed, so I was disappointed. But overall, I enjoyed it and teared up in the end"
M,4,It was slow at times.
Jae,5,Everything was top tier
Eric,5,I never seen original cartoon so I went in with no bias a open mind. I loved the movie. My daughter loved it too. The audience interviewed theater with me seemed to enjoy it also. Great Disney movie.

Shuntay Chester,5,This movie was EXCELLENT from beginning to end.
Amit,5,excellent movie and songs
Jennifer,5,Excellent movie! Halle was outstanding Academy award performance
Angel,5,Hallie voice was amazing
Margie,3,"The movie was beautiful but I expected more, 90 % of the movie was the same as the first Disney movie , every time I knew what was going to happen and also the text was the same. The actors where beautiful and the movie was oke , not spectacular. My children where thinking the same. We all adore the first Disney movie though"
Diane,3,It was too long. Not good for small children
Angele R,5,This film did the animated film justice. Pleasantly surprised
Katie,5,Great movie!!! Definitely recommend seeing it!

Jeanine L,5,Loved the entire movie!  The modernized redo was phenomenal.

Margo D Greenwell,5,I loved the beautiful seenery and the story!
Lee,5,This was an amazing and well produced movie!
Kristin,5,I loved the beautiful colors and how real everything was. I was mesmerized the whole movie and Im 34 years old. Well done
Linda H,4,Not for young children.  Violence and scary scenes.  It is a movie better suited for adults.  I would not take my young child to see it.  Special effects were outstanding.
Jules,5,I was skeptical about a live action but this movie is truly great. I love the cartoon but there is something special about this one.
luis r,2,"many changes in the story, I'm talking about the story of the movie NOT THE CHARACTERS"
Betty D,5,"The movie is colorful,  excellent music and the animation is incredible.  It's based on the Caribbean sea so she is the perfect Ariel.  At one point the movie gets slow but it's based on the original from almost 40 years ago, for me there was not difference.  I highly recommend to see it in a Max screen so you can enjoy the underwater animation better."
Mary R,5,"Disney Magic, loved it!"
Jody D,5,"The music, the actors and the special effects were all excellent"
Tony,4,"Movie wasnt bad, I just dont think there was much in the area of 3D effects to make that an option for this film."
LaTarra,5,Really love the movie!!
Mia,5,It was heartwarming to see this movie again as an adult. Halle was a perfect pick.
Kenneth,4,Best of the live action remakes so far.
Tony,5,"did not tarnish the original animated version. good, clean vocals 👍🏼👍🏼"
Diana S,2,"Saw it in 3D. A couple of us fell asleep during the middle. Don't know why Eric had a song to sing. The beginning and ending were good. Ursula stole the show.  Wouldn't pay to see it again, should have waited for the free streamiing."
Lynn,5,"Was one of the best movies we saw in a long time.
We laughed, cried, danced and sang..  We even got a few goosebumps. Recommend seeing!!!!"
Blanca Charles,1,Horrible changes in music. Prince Eric looks 45 and Ariel’s a teenager. It’s creepy! Way too long of a movie! Don’t waste your money like I did.
Debra,5,"Good acting, great songs, a little rap in there. Kept the girls interested"
Teresa,5,"I love the animation and the leading actress. She was beautiful. I could have done without prince Erics song but, overall it was a good film. I enjoyed it."
thorigrimm,5,They've considerably improved the depth and relatableness of the characters compared to the original. Very impressed! Wonderful fairytale.
Doreen G,5,"It was perfect!  The music, the effects, the added back story on Prince Eric.  Everyone was amazing.  Melissa McCarthy was perfect as Ursula"

Francine,5,"Its an amazing movie, love , love, love  ."
Danielle J,5,"I LOVED the spin on some of the original songs, and it was amazing in 3D. Halle and Melissa stole the show and I even cried at the end. I felt like the little girl who loved the animated film in the 90s, and I’m going to see it again."
Quitta W,5,This movie went beyond my expectations Thank you Disney for giving us something to cherish for years to come
Nakeisha F,5,This movie was Everything! My daughter was super Excited and Engaged the entire movie. I Loved and Enjoyed everything about this movie. Excellent job Disney!!!
joshua,5,GREAT MOVIE !!! SAW IT THURSDAY on the 25th it was sooo amazing!! I will be watching it again. Congratulations to Halle Bailey and the entire cast !! The movie can be rewatched several times! GIVE HALLE HER EGOT !!!!!!!!!!
Jeffrey M,5,This is a must must see movies. Phenomenal work 👏🏾 from the beginning to the end. It's definitely a 5 star 🎬 and rated 10/10
Mattie,5,It was a good spin on the original. The actors were phenomenal. The African American mermaid's name was a little harsh. A few of the close up views needed touch ups. The movie was moving and just so cute. A real feel good with all the bad stuff going on in the world.
Cassidy,5,The cast was good and everything was displayed correctly.
James,4,The movie was true to script and reflects modern realities of family and beauty and love.
Alexander,3,"The movie was visually appealing, and I found Halle Bailey to be a very good Ariel. That being said, while it was decent overall, it fails to capture the magic of the original. The new music was not very good, and one song in particular (The Scuttlebutt) was just awful and out of place in the movie."
Jamie,3,Liked the story line and the music.
Heather,5,"Little Mermaid was fantastic! I recommend seeing it in 3D if possible, its stunning! I felt like I was under water! Im always skeptical about a remake of a classic but they did the original Justice!"
Karie,5,The movie was great just very short but I will see it again
Dean,5,Wow is all that I can say
Shonda,5,Loved the live adaptation! Watched it with my 6 year old and she loved it as well!
Mariah B,5,"10/10! probably the best disney live action remake that mirrors the original ANIMATED version..and doing so in the live action. Halle Bailey was excellent and the perfect person to play ariel, the entire cast for for each role. Its a must see for any and all ages!! I definitely will be seeing it again!"
Jorge R,3,"Ariel sidekicks should have had a deeper color, they looked bland. More mermaids should have been shown, that community looked empty."
Ann,4,I thought the cinematography was excellent. Actors were very good. Only thing I disliked is that it dragged in the middle - could have cut some of that out and then it would hold younger ones attention better.
Jonathan M.,5,I absolutely loved this film! I loved that nostalgia with a new twist! I loved sharing this with my children! Absolute must see if you are a Little Mermaid fan!
Kara,4,"This was a a great live action Disney movie. Ariel and Eric have chemistry. I love Scuttle! 
The Chefs song is the biggest disappointment. I loved that part in the animated version and to not have it at all was just sad. Ursula wasnt as good as the animated version either and Flounder is creepy. 
Halle Bailey gives a wonderful performance."
so25,5,I thought the acting and visual effects were brilliant!
Sophia,5,I loved everything about this movie.
Dana W,5,"the movie was awesome. I thought Chole's performance was top tier. I felt like a kid again, while watching with my kid. I sang a long, my child sang a long. it was an awesome afternoon!"
Asmar W,5,It was excellent! Halle Bailey is a star! Melissa McCarthy was exceptional as Ursula. And Daveed Diggs was smashing as Sbastien! Take the whole family!
Mahlia,5,"This movie was everything I imagined it to be. Very whimsical and exciting. The visuals had me in awe, and I was even more stunned by the storyline since this is my first time seeing The Little Mermaid ever. Of course, I now have to go watch the original  love love loved it !"
Annette,5,"I loved all the characters. Everyone played there parts well. The pelican, crab,& fish was my favorite of all in the show. They kept us laughing during the whole movie."
Careema,5,Its was an amazing movie my babies and I loved it
Dent Diva,5,This was the best live depiction Ive seen of a Disney movie. My 3 year old absolutely loved the movie.
Marvin R. Jr.,5,I loved seeing Halle as Ariel..stunning show stunning performance..highly recommend. 10/10 across the boards for the entire cast as well as Rob Marshall and the soundtrack too…10/10/0!
JA,4,"Honestly, I dont get what all the irritation over the movie was. It was well done, the minor line change to Kiss the Girl was hardly noticeable, and the additional storyline and characters made it great. It was made as a live action but had its own additions which made it that much more enjoyable. If it comes down to the color of any of the characters, then you lack the humanity to enjoy most things Id imagine. Melissa McCarthy as Ursula was amazing. Some of the CGI parts couldve been a little smoother, and getting a clearer shot of inflated Ursula wouldve been nice. All in all though, pretty dang good."
Jessica,4,Great movie but leave the little kids at home for this its longer and a live action most people with small children were leaving because the kids were not interested in the movie I miss Les poissons but the new music was good too!
Dame,5,Great singing performances!
Alex B.,4,"I was really not expecting to cry with this movie and it happened 3 times. The girl that does Ariel is so sweet, you’ll fall in love with her along with the prince. They built up the lagoon scene so well and the transitions into songs was so organic. It has some humor sprinkled here and there but just the necessary and very well written and executed. Every actor was so well casted and did a magnificent job. Didn’t give it 5 stars because of Under the sea but maybe I am biased because I was used to the Spanish version from the 90s which was perfect."
leslie,5,loved it with my whole entire heart i cried at the end but mainly because i had daddy issues unlike when i first saw the animated one when i was like six but overall i don’t know whether i wanna be or be with halle bailey but ok damn well eric could get into my world def recommend so many fine ppl casted love mellissa mccarthy she was funny and loved her in gilmore girls just overall 100/10 but let’s just say if daddy tritain was my dad i would wanna leave the sea but can’t blame her after looking at the fine hunk of an eric
Cynthia L,4,"Watched the old version a hundred times, but this rendition was beautiful! As life like as it gets! Very inclusive of all races & blended cultures! Great to sing along to! Visuals were right on!!"
Glenn T,5,Great family movie. My two daughters loved the live action version of LM.
Deborah J,5,My granddaughters and I loved this movie! The vocals were amazing.  I  highly recommend it.
Cait,3,I liked the movie. But I am an original little mermaid fan. I dont like how the wedding wasnt on the boat. And how Eric sang a song.  But Id definitely watch it again.
Nicole,4,"Beautiful movie, loved the actors, but it is unnecessarily long (especially for kids)."
Elizabeth C,5,Love it this movie did justice to the original 🥰🧜‍♀️
Maritza N,5,Best Disney live animated movie. Loved Ariel’s (Halle) voice and acting. Scuttlebut song by Aquafina is a jam. Phenomenal Graphics/live animation/everything!
Tom-Tom,5,They added a few songs that weren't bad. and they added a few extra scenes but they all played in well to the original story. But overall a great movie to see with you friends or family.
Blue J,5,It was a lovely movie 10/10
Lucretia  J,5,I absolutely loved it!!
Ash,5,It was more than I expected. The entire theater erupted with applause when the movie was over. I’m grateful that my daughter got to witness this moment in history.
kaitlyn f,5,I can not put into words how I feel with this movie. It hit all of the right notes and more. Halle was amazing she is her and she was made for this role she put all of her soul into this movie. The music blew me away i looking forward to seeing it again and again and again.
Rico,5,Really enjoyed this movie. Halle is amazing!!
Beau K,5,Best Disney live action yet!
Kimberly P,4,Great movie and amazing job Halle Bailey!

Lucas,5,"Don’t believe the haters, a well made Disney classic!"
Christina,5,It was such a beautiful movie!
M,5,"AMAZING MOVIE, LOVE HALLE BAILEY"
Marlene,4,It left out parts from the original that were my favorite.  Was a little disappointed.
Natalie,5,Breathtakingly beautiful. I almost cried a few times from the nostalgia. The casting was perfect. Scuttle and Sebastian did not disappoint. Ariel was perfection. King Triton knocked it out of the park. Ursula was the most devious and amazing. they all were on point
Kaya,5,"I absolutely loved it, I wanted to cry. It’s amazing seeing a mermaid that looks like me, loved this she did an awesome performance!"
Erika Claudon,5,Asombrosa! Halle Bailey es excelente 👏👏👏

Sharon,4,I loved everything!!!
Danita H,5,Love all the vibrant colors and the music was great
Darryl T,5,"Halle Bailey took the character of Ariel and made it her own. No wonder she raised the bar so high, no other actress could even touch her. I love that that Disney made Erics kingdom more of a Caribbean type of  kingdom   Just so multi cultural. Excellent job Disney!!!"
B-Rad,5,This movie was incredible. The new songs were an amazing addition.
charles b,4,"Very good adaptation of the original. Fun movie. They cut out the seen where Sebastian fights with the chef. Akwafina as Skuttle was the best.
Only issue is that Halle didnt capture the bubbly spirit of Ariel. Unfortunately like many movies today, they turn the star into a depressed teenager. Her performance and singing were great."
Osvaldo,4,It was fun for the whole family
Rachel,0,Halle Bailey 💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖

Brian W,5,Halle Bailey is amazing. She transcends the role of Ariel
douglas,5,A SEQUEL RIGHT NOW PLEASE!
Aaralyn,4,Felt a little rushed at times but good!
Mina,4,"A great live action retelling of the source material with a more in-depth look at characters that was not done in the animated version! Nothing groundbreaking, but still a cute live action of The Little Mermaid worth watching!"
Elizabeth,2,Ariel and ursula were perfect but the movie was just boring.
Audelia,0,I feel like the movie wasn’t true to its characters especially Ariel and the one who played her was great but I feel it should stay true to the original movie 100%. Don’t change what doesn’t need  changing.
Madison,4,must see for all! loved it!!
Arianne B,5,Really enjoyed the remake. Definitely a movie to see with the whole family.
Christian,5,Love everything about it!

Lorali,4,Such a fun and enjoyable movie experience!  I saw the original in theaters when I was 11 and today I got to take my slightly older 17yr daughter and we both just absolutely loved it.
RJB,5,It was beautiful 🩷🧜🏼‍♀️
Marian W,5,I love this movie!  I loved how they evolved the story to give Eric and Ariel more agency and added some lovely new songs.  I felt like I was seeing my childhood favorite movie and snorkeling!  Amazing!
Daniel,5,This is the first of the Disney live-action remakes that we've liked. This movie was really good! It might also be the first of the remakes that we watch again when it makes it to streaming.

Jordin,5,Disney did this remake justice. Halle was a great version of Ariel Her voice is beautiful and he acting was beyond great
Sarah,3,"Melissa McCarthy played the perfect Ursula. The movie mostly followed the original. Ariel was beautiful and I am so happy to see more diverse characters. Grimsby was fantastic. Loved that they added some more scenes to showcase who Eric was. The only real let down was that Triton didn’t feel like a dad who was worried about his little girl. He was sort of flat and didn’t have much chemistry with other characters at all. That could be the CGI making it harder to get into character, I guess. Overall, it was nostalgic and beautiful! Loooooved the Scuttlebutt song!"

Jaime Z,4,Faithful to the original but with some updates to geography and the people that inhabit the Caribbean.
Bill,5,Melissa McCarthy A+ Music A+ Jonah(Eric) A+ Sebastian A+ VFX A+ Directing A+ An incredibly difficult task to remake a classic. They knocked it out of the park. Well done
manuela,5,Absolutely awesome movie!!!
Sabrina,4,Actors did a great job.  singing was way too loud at times.  that may have been controlled by the theater. A few parts may have been alarming to smaller children. Not sure if this was announced or not.

Google,5,I like it because it was an amazing movie. I might want to see it again.
Kate,5,I loved the fresh take on a childhood favorite of mine. I’ve been reluctant to share original animation to my kids cause it’s so white and sexist. Great cast and thrilled to show my kids even if they were scared of Ursula.
Jeremiah L,3,"Solid film, great songs- new and old. McCarthy was great and Halle got the job done, she was good. It’s not without its flaws, mainly the questionable CGI at times, but it’s a fun film."
Josi,5,Awesome love Halle her singing would give me chills nostalgia Simone Ashley was in it but only for a sec wish she would’ve had more dialogue

Stay,5,"The Little Mermaid 

As a live version and the characters that starred in the movie was amazing and the Directors, Producers, Stage managers, the whole team, giving credit to bringing Alvin Alley, in was perfect timing.  
The culture the diverse in the characters of different walks the colors and the costumes in characters was the best out of all the live movie versions of Disneys.

Halle Bailey as The Little Mermaid, did an amazing job, a gift, well done, sang, yes! The abs on her, you could tell the hard work that was put in she owned it for all the characters it came from within.  In swimming to the acting and the singing, you can tell was physically, mentally and spiritually intense, for her. Prince Eric, Jonah Hauer, yes, you did it all.  For Art Malik as Grimsby, you played an excellent role!  

Awkwafina voices of Scuttle, they had her play that role and all she put in, perfect,  The hard work! Thank you!

Javier Bardem portrays King Triton, Ariel's protective father and ruler of the sea. Omg, he was outstanding yes, all of the sisters were beautiful, ""Hamilton"" and ""Snowpiercer"" star Daveed Diggs voice of Sebastian the crab, well done 

Melissa McCarthy as she gave up her Ursula wig, (awesome) and learned to swim like 'a creature who lives in the water, this is amazing with everyone who had a role in water had to do the same.  Although she did a well twist spin on the song and acting.

Jessica Alexander who played the role of Vanessa, Ursula's human alter-ego.  Well done!

The original Ursula still was a better version to me, in the cartoon Disney Classic.  

All put in the hard work in preparation for their roles and what they had to work through in watching the original version to getting it to taking direction and learning the lines roles and getting and staying into the characters.

For all of Ariels sister beautiful I just wish we would have see more of them as the original,  flounder was amazing, but I think for him being Ariels best friend in the original they fell short of his role to play, we needed to see more of him. But the rest of the animals character carried the movie. 

The digitally, computer graphics were amazing on knowing the levitating movements were very real, everyone that took part amazing!  

Listening to the children in the theater was so funny.  I grew up on Disney and will remain through it all, I would even see it again, thats how much I enjoyed.  Thank you!
Blessings"
Nereyda W,5,A great mix of the old version with new!

Halle was so charming as Ariel and Perfect. if you didn't like the movie it had nothing to do with her performance.  my niece loved it. the songs were fun, and Halle's Part of your world was stunning.

Lisa W,5,My daughters and I enjoyed it very much.
cheekocheeko,4,"movie aligned with the original cartoon with some updated cultural appropriation.  the singing for Ariel was awesome.b the prince guy singing almost made me walk out and leave my kids..the movie was mostly CGI , they should of follow suit and made it more vibrant and amazing like avatar. yet it seemed dull and visually lacking . .."
DASH,5,Critics know nothing!  This was FAR better and realistic than the animated movie and I enjoyed the animated movie. Rob Marshall had the right idea and the ending is more powerful for all especially Ariel.
Elena,5,Amazing and they kept it like the original only better! Love how diverse the characters were!
Felicia M,5,"We loved everything about the movie! There were a few changes from the original, but they were good changes. I definitely recommend watching it."

"""Not too bad at all""",3,"Not too bad! Probably the best of the live action disney remakes. I havent been a huge fan of them but this one works the best.

All the characters were cast well. Javier Bardem as King Triton was perfect. The colors were dazzling.

Ariel's voice was amazing.

Was a live action remake necessary? No. Did this one do the job well though? Yes."
KellyKFlix,5,"One of the best— If not THE BEST—live action adaptations of a beloved cartoon classic Ive ever seen. It was true to the original with music and theme, but added enough new (original songs, continuation of verses to fit new story) that kept it fresh. It was perfectly cast and entertained my husband and I (both mid 40s who loved the original) and our two sons (19 and 8). So happy we went to the theater for this one!"
Arnold,5,Didn’t keep the little kids attention but super good for the older ones .
Jasmeen,5,"The movie was awesome

mrsdpm,5,"Story stayed true to the original, and the singing was absolutely amazing!"
Janice W,3,"I thought the design of the ocean was beautiful. Great scenery filmed in Sardona, Italy,  Great love story although Ariel is a teenager and Eric is an adult at 21 yrs of age.  I can't see her enjoying the life being on a ship.  Crowd clapped during the performance of the songs though."
Ellen,5,I thought the movie was well done matched the cartoon to a tee I would definitely go see it again
Alyssa,5,Me and my daughter loved the movie a lot she was sing along and dancing in the chair lol

Peggy M K,5,"3D graphics were phenomenal, I  truly enjoyed it with my two granddaughters."
Cynthia,5,Loved the sea creatures…. Eric’s new Song … Ursula the king and of course the little Mermaid!!💋
Monique W,5,I loved the 3D picture and all of the visual effects.  Halle Bailey did an awesome job playing the role of Ariel.
Sean M,5,"That was transformative! I already knew she had the chips vocally (seriously astounding), but I never knew how capable she was as an actor. Every single scene she is in, she pulled you in and it was the most endearing thing. All the characters were great and the colors were so amazing to see. We all had the time of our lives. Going to see it again for sure!"
Connie  B,5,I loved the Caribbean feel
Akeima,5,It was a great movie. Especially in 4d. Her voice. The action. Best movie ever

Louis,5,Really great film. The lead actress has an amazing voice!
Antonio,5,Great live action rendition to a Disney classic!!
Nai,3,Movie is great however the t heather had no a/c
tyrone r,5,Great movie for the family.
Ute,5,"Absolutely loved it. Amazing cast. Halle Bailey couldn't be beat in this role and had great chemistry with her co-star. Some parts of the storyline changed slightly but for the better. The newly added songs are great and complement the existing favorites perfectly. 
At over 2 hours in length it may be a little too long for the littlest kids but it never felt too long. 
We watched ithe movie a 2nd time, after seeing it on IMAX, this time in 3D. Probably preferred the visual appeal of 3D."
Dezza S,5,Very moving and beautifully done.  Loved the new and old songs
antonio,4,Very much like the cartoon. Kinda to long
Wendy,5,Movie was great ! The theater bathrooms were nasty and no paper towels. Most of the drink machines were out.

La Quinta,5,"Halle was absolutely amazing, Melissa McCarthy was dramatic perfection and Javier Bardeim embodied King Triton  like none other! Wonderful movie!"
Rosa,3,The beginning was boring for me. And after she found out that the witch had the necklace with her voice the movie went by so fast and finished.
Veronica T,5,Halle was the PERFECT choice for the role! BEAUTIFUL VOICE!!
mark,2,Subpar acting.  There are too many changes from the original movie.  too long and drawn out.  made an 80 minute classic movie drawn out to 130 mins.  now worth the money to see in theater.  wait for Disney plus.
Elisa,1,"The colors were washed out, it felt like I was looking through foggy goggles, the characters seemed forced. The movie volume was not loud enough. I could hear the person next to me chewing. It was an awful experience."
ALANNA W,4,"Great acting, singing. Funny and awesome animation"
Charlotte,5,Very good. Lots of action. Liked the story line. Beautiful colors.
Asha S,5,Phenomenal movie! I always side eye Disney when it comes to the live actions but they really surprised me with this. Prince Eric and Ursula performance really blew me away!! Not a fan of Scuttle. Just didn’t do it for me. Other than that one character the movie was great from beginning to end! Definitely go see. Also it’s a little lengthy in my opinion. Just a heads up for the kiddos that may get restless.
Ev.n.mella,5,Classic with an amazing twist! Great fathers day movie to watch for fathers and their daughters. 10/10
Shanika,5,"It was absolutely amazing! 10/10! From the cast to the scenes, to the set and design. Everything was great! Must see!"

Els,2,I didnt expect so much to be different from the original.
Larendra M,5,It was beautiful. Not only did we love it but our daughter enjoyed it as well. Wish we could've given it 10 stars. Definitely will be going to see it again with the other kids.
Jazz,4,"Halle Bailey, Melissa McCarthey and Daveed  Diggs understood the assignment."
Rosy,5,"It was 98% to the original movie, the cast was peeeeeeeeeeeeerfect from Ariel to Sebastian, the 2 % I didnt give them is because I would of loooove to see Sebastian running on the kitchen, the Seagull was a boy, also some songs that were Joy part of the movie and some other small details like Ariel brushing her hair while eating dinner and Ursula saying my poor little poops instead of my babies ."
Meron,5,Loved it! So did my girls! Anything set outside of a Denmark is a deviation from the original story so Im okay with the new faces! Will watch again.
Fulton,5,"Awesome movie.  We saw it in 3-D which made it even better.  It followed the original story very well, and the songs were great.  We will watch it again."
Ron,5,"This Movie is SO GOOD! It is everything that I'd hoped for. Halle Bailey is a SUPERSTAR. Between her MAGNIFICENT Voice & Acting Chops, she is a Force to be Reckoned With for decades to come. It doesn't hurt she is SUPER CUTE and one of the most Beautiful women in Film today!!!

Oh, by the way, Melissa McCarthy was Eye Poppingly Wonderful!! She showed range I never thought she had!! This movie is going to get her a lot more work when casting directors see how AMAZING she is in this movie. Obviously, same goes for Halle Bailey. What a performance!!

If it has a knock, and I'm NOT saying it does, it could have been 20 minutes shorter.

I REALLY loved this Movie, and I am in my 40's."
Tanisha,5,Loved it!  There were multiple messages in  this movie ! Love them all!
Quinton,5,This movie is great. Halle Bailey is phenomenal and the other actors are absolutely fantastic. This movie is definitely a must see.

Virginia Edwards,5,Phenomenal movie! Me and my daughter loved it
Arron,3,"Little mermaid was and still is one of my favorite movies. It was good for the culture to have a black mermaid, however they could have stayed true to the movie. The white girl gets saved and gets to live happily ever after but the black one is the hero. when will we get saved and stop trying to save everybody. the movie could have gone without the extra scenes and how did they drop the scene with Sébastien and the cook fighting. that was epic. why?"

Cindy,5,"Wonderful live action remake! Halle Berry has a powerful voice. Enjoyed Daveed Diggs as Sebastian, Akwafina as Scuttle. Lin Manuel Miranda added several great songs which added a nice update. I do think Melissa McCarthy was alittle scary for really small kids. She made a wicked splash as Ursula. Go & enjoy"

Kia,5,The movie was good. Actually better than the cartoon that came out during my childhood. Its a must see.

Most of it is gorgeous. Highly recommend."

Princess Tianna,5,"Absolutely loved it. It had many nods to the original, but still made it relevant for today. In the end, love conquers hate."
Jared M,5,"It was a beautiful reimagining of The Little Mermaid. Halle Bailey is luminous and has a stunning voice. She perfectly embodies Ariel. Melissa McCarthy was a delight as Ursula. Javier Bardem made a great King Triton. Jonah is so handsome and talented. The whole cast was wonderful. The film is a visual and auditory treat. The orchestrations were well done. The three new songs were unnecessary, but they werent bad. Okay, Scuttlebutt was kinda bad.  Overall, though, the movie hit all the right spots for this huge longtime fan of TLM. I did fight to hold back my sobs towards the end. I am deeply moved.  Thank you Rob Marshall, Alan Menken, Howard Ashman, and Lin-Manuel Miranda for this gift."
Phyllis B,5,This movie is fantastic.
Gregory C,3,It runs a bit by long. Lots of younger viewers needed a beak or some two. Visually it is pretty remarkable.
Sundai,5,"Loved it! Stayed true to the original, and Halle has such a beautiful voice 😍"
Terrie,4,"Mellisa McCarthy was amazing as Ursula.  Awesome graphics for the water scenes.  Missed the part they eliminated for Sbastien almost being cooked, they should have found a way to include it. Really enjoyed the movie but they were trying so hard to be New and PC that they left some of the fun and quotable lines from the original story."

Lynn noel,5,One of the best movies I've seen in a while
Abigail,2,"The cgi was horrible and the auto tune for the voices was too fake. They strayed from the actual story plot too much and a lot of things didnt make sense. Its worth going to see just to say youve seen it, but youll unfortunately leave underwhelmed.  2 stars"
Monique Dizon,1,The movie overall was cute but missed a lot of core elements from the original animated movie. I was literally falling asleep in the middle of the movie due to the large pauses.
Louann J H,5,Colors wee beautiful  dining was fantastic  and the villan was GREAT

Olivia,4,I knew what was going to happen so I wish something would’ve been added but overall 8/10 singing was great. “Eric” could’ve been better. Almost a replica of the original
Lashaie,5,Absolutely amazing!!!!
Mia B.,5,The diversity of the cast and the special effects were great!
Anissa,5,I loved this version. The cinematography was superior and Halle Bailey did an exceptional job as the Little Mermaid. Visually beautiful masterpiece.
Niesha M,5,"This movie was such a great rendition of the original, obviously things were different because it was live action but I think the cast did an amazing job. I don’t have any issues with the few changes they made to movie to keep up with the times. The vocals were top notch and the acting from the lead roles were right on point. I would definitely see it again and if you haven’t seen don’t allow negative review dissuade from forming your opinion on it. Unfortunately the times we’re living in is causing people give low reviews simply because of the lead actress race(simply just sad world)."
Hannah,4,"We loved the music and the Kiss the Girl scene, Im also glad they stuck to the original story line"
Frenchyy,5,The singing was awesome and the cast was great
Jessie B,4,"a visually beautiful film. one song went on too long in my opinion and one sequence was too short. If the song would have been cut short for the film, that time given to the sequence at the end, and one more thing I don't want to say but it wouldn't add time just change a scene it would have been as close. to a perfect live action you could get. It's my favorite of the live action remakes."
Chris P,4,a new spin on the animated classic
Kei,5,"Phenomenal movie. Loved the new songs. Loved the end scene with Ariel and Dad. I saw the original when I was 9 in 1989 and I'm so thankful to be able to take my 9 year old to see a movie I loved so much. My daughter  enjoyed it as well and keeps saying ""Skuttlebutt""."
JC.Borrero,5,Was soooooo amazing! It completely exceeded my expectations!
Marcus,5,"Wonderful movie. I love that they stayed close to the original animated movie but, also added to it. Halle was an incredible Ariel. Melissa McCartney crushed it as Ursula."
Victoria J,5,Music and animation were fabulous!
Connie,5,We all over the movie!!  The time flew by!!!
mark H,4,Cinematography was amazing
Judah,1,"stop making these, please. either make it all CG or don't, or at least give us something new. would have been less wack if all the songs were new or if they just dropped the musical aspect all together. didn't feel like it was for the kids and it didn't feel like it was for fans of the original either, so who is this for besides Disney? pretty much felt like Disney giving itself a pat on the back for a job well done 40 years ago and cashing in on that a second time with a fraction of the effort. I'd never spend money on this and I regret doing so, only went because my girlfriend is susceptible to their marketing tactics. both thumbs down."
Eileen R,5,it was different than the original. it was delightful. Halle was lovely and has a beautiful singing voice. She added charm to the character. I especially like the ending.  Not just a wedding but the couple left to do something for the world together.
Heather P,5,"other than the whole thing about changing Ariel's race for no reason, the movie was fantastic. not sure why people are hating on it so much"
Denzel,5,"This was absolutely incredible! Love that the main characters are more fleshed out! The chemistry btw Ariel and Eric, so good! And I’m gonna say it bc I’m not afraid to, This Version is Better than the Original 🤷🏾‍♂️ good jobs Disney you outdid yourself!!"
Allison,5,OMG! Yes the BEST LITTLE MERMAID EVER!
Indira,5,"Exceptional film! I loved everything about this one including the additional 40 mins of storyline. Halle Bailey as Ariel was captivating and those big, beautiful doe eyes were perfect for his film. I must also admit I loved the fact that one of her sisters had my name. The diversity in case was outstanding!! Plan to see it again next weekend!"
Elizabeth W,5,We love the way Disney brought life to The Little Mermaid. The singing was heartfelt. I felt like she was talking to all the little girls /women in the audience.
Cesear,5,"movie was unbelievably perfect. couldn't have been any better. Disney actually made a perfect film. Don't follow hater critics. this movie beats the animated 1,000,000x 

a must see!!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥"
Lorrie,5,Fantastic job on the actors playing the various roles. LOVED Melissa McCarthy as Ursula! Can't think of anyone better to fulfill that role. Xavier Bardem as King Triton was spot on as well. Halle Berry was perfect for Ariel. What a beautiful voice she has!  Plenty of humor and a few tears as well.
Shenyca,5,"The movie was soooo good..had us all on the edge of our seats... even though you know what's going to happen,  it still left your holding your breath waiting to see the next scene..."

Del,5,"I loved it! The movie was so refreshing!. I took my Good-Daughter, and we had an amazing time."

albert b,4,entertaining and visually stunning. a little long but we enjoyed it.
Gene,5,Very good. Worth the watch
Michelle S,5,"I went into this (one of my childhood absolute favorites) with, I would say, average expectations based on Disney live action remakes lately and determined not to listen to critics having an attitude based on skin color. Yes, being a mixed girl it of course is cool to see someone like me as Ariel but would Halle be convincing as Ariel? Would Disney muck up the songs I loved so much? Would Prince Eric be cast well? Would the movie keep its heart? Me and my kids and best friend went to see it and bottom line? Yes, the songs and sequences were awesome and yes it very much kept its heart. In fact there were a few times tears came to my eyes. Heck I didn’t even mind Awkafina as Scuttle and Melissa McCarthy did pretty well as Ursula. But Halle? Boy oh boy did she shine and capture this inner little girls heart as Ariel!! Not just her glow but her voice and she captured a very sweet, curious and naive Ariel. I also enjoyed for the most part the new songs added and the songs and sequences for the songs I already know like Under the Sea. And I like the realism of Sebastian, Scuttle and Flounder even though I was a bit worried that might be weird. Finally, I would encourage whoever is reading this to not listen to whatever criticism you might have read about “wokeness” or whatever in casting,. Halle was absolutely well cast. And I am so happy I saw this! And you better believe I will buy it when it comes out 3"
branden2040,5,They did an amazing job! They made this story feel new but still feels like the original movie. The movie is truly beautiful.
Tania,5,This was the best remake and live adaptation Ive ever seen!! Loved every nostalgic moment of it!!
Charmaine S hines,5,We Loved everything !!!

ZoeB,5,"It was amazing! Beautiful, great songs, and we loved the new Ariel."
Google,3,My kids didn't  cater to hit cause it wasn't  animated but all the adults loved it.
Jaime,5,perfect casting! great movie and I loved every moment of it.  I will go see it again at a late showing so there are less small kids there.
Oilna,5,I love it. The singing was awesome
Bri,5,This movie exceeded my expectations in every way. Ariels singing was incredible. The storyline was great. I could feel the emotion. Amazing job. Well done!
sanja,3,"It was a pretty good movie. The CGI and animation could have been a bit better: like Aquaman.
The story followed along with the original movie well, too, which was nice.
The concept of changing the ethnicity of the characters,  I feel, was something to do, but didn't absolutely have to be done.
 It was just to appease people who can't seem to be pleased with leaving things as they are. ""Inclusivity"" is not required to be a great movie, although certain people are making it out that way. 
Regardless, was nice."
Tymicia,5,I loved watching this movie in 3D I love the pretty colors the way the water looks I will definitely be coming to watch it again
Nathan,4,Very good. I like it.
Kg,4,One of the best live action remakes.
Raghu  S,4,"Watched TheLittleMermaid on May 25th in AMC Theatres and Halle Bailey playing Ariel was the best casting ever. She became an instant star with this film. This live-action remake retains the heart and soul of the story we know and love, and its elevates even further with the storyline giving that Romeo-Juliet tale mixed with little bit of Disney's Hercules especially when it comes to the whole sibling rivalry. I am not really that much of a Melissa McCarthy fan, but her portrayal of Ursula it felt like she channeled the late Pat Carroll all the way. The scenes with Ursula and Ariel felt like Hades-Hercules at the underworld with the whole backdrop of Ursula lair. Then the chemistry with Halle Bailey and Jonah-Hauer King is perfect, natural and the high point of this film. When it came to VFX it felt wonky at times with the underwater sequences, but the song titles like ""Under the Sea..."", ""Kiss the Girl..."" etc., made you forget about those things and focus on the melodies because they were soothing to hear. Also, Sebastian the Crab OMG he is a scene stealer in every scene and Daveed Diggs honors the late Samuel Wright perfectly with the Caribbean accent and his scenes with Ariel are wonderful to watch and serves as a second father to Ariel. Definitely this is another great live action Disney film and Halle Bailey commands the story beautifully with her acting and her singing. She definitely has a bright future ahead. Definitely 9 out of 10 for me."
Angela,4,"I loved the little mermaid, they changed it a little, but was still awesome."
Alma,5,My grand kids love the movie as much as their dad did

Marlon  M,4,"A REVIEW OF THE LITTLE MERMAID  

We all know the story of Little Mermaid. This version follows the original animated film almost beat for beat with minor changes for the  live actions. 

Going to the cinema and seeing all the little black girls dress up as Mermaids was adorable. Even some of their mothers were dressed up too. The theater was packed. My wife had tears of joy as Ariel sang her first song. 

Halle Bailey is a star. Every second she was on screen was magic. Melissa Mccarthy ate every sceen she was in as Ursula. While this is not a perfect movie it is very enjoyable and easy to watch. The CGI on Sebastian, Flounder, and Scuttle are great. Sebastian played by Daveed Diggs has the funniest one-liners throughout the film. 

I hope everybody that was mad that a mythical imaginary creature, ie a Mermaid is Black, is punching air and crying over how much money this film is making. The representation in this film doesn't just stop with Halle Bailey, it goes throughout the entire cast. The film is a bit long and could have shaved 15 minutes off here and there. Plus there was a couple of unnecessary stipulations in Ursula's curse-spell that differ from the animated film for no logical reason but that's not making or breaking the film.

If you have little kids especially little girls, I highly recommend this film. Or if you're just feeling nostalgic and want to recapture your childhood go see this movie.

Grade:"
Courtney G,5,"I went to see Little Mermaid yesterday with my adult daughter. If you have not planned to go, stop what you are doing, look at available times in your movie theatre and get your butt there!!  It is fantastic!!

Dianne S,5,"From the moment the original came out in 1989 my daughter was hooked at 2 years old! We both, along with her daughters, watched this movie. We all agree that it's the best animation to real life adaption we have EVER seen! Actor selection for roles were spot on! This is definitely a movie we will all purchase and rewatch for years to come!
A. MUST. SEE."
Google,5,I love the movie the second time around
Odalys Macias,1,"I didn't like it. Songs were different,  ariel should of had red hair, there is a part of the movie she isn't supose to have a voice and they show her singing  I honestly didn't like it I expected something real pretty like the actual little mermaid."
Sunflower,5,"The Best movie since COVID, on tv or in theaters!!! The story behind it. The beautiful underworld, spectacular!! The voices of each character beautifully, wisely chosen, the singing took my breath away!!!!! This movie had the children in the movie laughing, giggling, clapping and cheering in the end.

Izzy Paramo,2,Not what I was Expecting.
Presley,3,It was cute and I liked Prince Erics song. But I didnt like the ending. I dont understand why every Disney movie needs to change the roles of who is being saved. I loved it the original way. The movie wasnt bad but it wasnt great. The love action Beauty and the Beast and Cinderella set the bar really high for love actions.

Amador,5,Wow surprised all my expectations of a Disney remake
Marissa,5,"Made me cry throughout the whole movie! I saw one of my most beloved childhood movies put to life and with a lead that looks like me. I feel for me and other girls like me Hallie made us part of the world we are always excluded from. The music was excellent, the settings majestically, and overall I had a wonderful time"
Henry Cavill,5,"My family and I enjoyed the movie. Beautiful music, visually, great, and enjoy the storyline. Nice popcorn movie."

Lydia,5,I loved it it was so beautiful the ocean scenes were beautiful Disney always makes movies over the top

Musey101,5,Loved the numbers and the scenery was gorgeous. Well done choice of musicality. Gripping.
Vicman,4,"My daughter's enjoyed the whole movie. Definitely brought nostalgia and memories from the original cartoon version. I personally felt it was a tad too long but overall enjoyed it as well. Also missing one of my favorite parts, Sebastin vs the Chef in the kitchen and boat scenes."

Liz,5,"The movie was amazing!! Ive been a little mermaid fan since a child and for old-time sake went to see the movie on my birthday. Since it is a live-action remake I expected certain elements to change, but honestly, it didnt disappoint. If you are willing to give a live-action Disney movie a chance let at least be The Little Mermaid."
David A,5,Not bad for a live action.
Latasia,5,I absolutely loved it!! The kids enjoyed every moment especially the extra scenes and songs! Disney did not disappoint us! And I so loved how the movie stick to the main script majority of the time.

Beverly B,4,Lovely movie and awesome scenery on a huge screen!
Katrina,5,"I loved everything about the movie!!
No dislikes"
Destiny,4,The movie was great despite the reviews. The only thing that was bad was the acting of king triton. Thru took some things out and added some new from the original but I enjoyed it
Charity  N,5,This was beautifully made and the new songs were amazing to hear as well as the old I was transported back to being a kid all over again except this time the little mermaid looked like me! Loved this!

Joseph T,5,Fun movie!! The best live action remake Disney has done!!

craig m,0,the acting was the worst I've seen from a Disney movie.  everything about it was literally painful to watch compared to the original.

Chanel,5,"Incredible! Beautiful colors, amazing voice and lovely plot. Halley was made for this role!"
Meeka,5,Beautiful take on a classic movie
Father of Three Girls,1,"Not great. Some very cringe moments especially the ones where the sentimentality is spread on way too thick. Eric doing a solo, eek. Ariels father popping his head out of the blue as theyre on their way to their new life together. Double eek. The one star is for Melissa McCarthys stellar turn as Medusa."
Aaron S,4,Overall it was great. Wife and daughter liked it a bit more than I did. Wasn’t a fan of the solo prince Eric song.
sidda,5,literally the best live action movie disney has ever done
latrice,5,"This was the most beautiful and amazing movie I’ve seen… Growing up wasn’t able to watch most of the Disney and animated movies, But how as an adult I’m playing catch and really don’t mind it… I have Nieces and Nephews and would love for them to experience it all… Love love love this movie.

Brittaney,5,Great Movie Loved It ! Childhood Unlocked
Google,5,"I love how this film proves us that anyone can be a mermaid and merman, no matter what color skin that person have. Its all about diversity for every minority groups. But more importantly, I love how they show positive representation for the Black community that never see themselves as merpeople before. Also, I love how they continue the storyline and still made it modern therefore, show us that Ariel did not left her kingdom and family for a man."

Neisha,4,Definitely a good watch. So much cooler in 3D. Probably even better in 3D and IMAX. Definitely a good movie with tones of laughs and super cool effects.

Hunter,5,"The best Disney remake I've seen since Aladdin. Sebastian and Scuttle brought the laughs while Ariel and Eric brought the charm. The visuals may be a bit dodgy, but they're still beautiful."
Bianca S,5,Disney did right by this live version of the The Little Mermaid. Halle Bailey was the perfect Ariel! My 1.5 year old daughter was tuned in up until the very end! I would definitely watch it in theaters again! 10/10 highly recommend

Don't know how they taped so many of the scenes, how actors were talking and their hair was floating around them like they were underwater.  The girl who played Ariel had an amazing voice, all the music was awesome.  There is nothing that I didn't like about it.  It was the usual high quality Disney movie.  Loved it!!"

Jen,5,"We absolutely loved it, even my teenager who wasn't that excited about it! You always worry when you have such a beloved movie with iconic songs but y'all, that Halle can SING!! Her version of Part of Your World was phenomenal and Under the Sea was a BANGER. So much fun and Jonah was a great pic for Prince Eric and didn't hurt that he's a smoke show! 🤣"

Fan,5,"Wonderful picture-music, story, touching, effects-it has it all!"
dyson ☆,4,"Halle Bailey i’m so proud of you… I laughed, I cried, I smiled, I sang.

Dalton Wright,3,"The Little Mermaid was a fun watch. It does the original justice while bringing a new vibe. Halle Bailey was incredible as Ariel. I’d give it a 5 star but it didn’t bring enough originality however, how much originality can you bring to an almost shot for shot remake? Would recommend it to any fan of the original The Little Mermaid or any Disney enthusiasts."
Olivia N,5,"I was 4 in 1989, and I couldnt be happier with how well they adapted it. Halle Baileys a literal living siren, wonderful emotive performance, great chemistry among the actors, well acted, funny, sweet, and utterly beautiful underwater visuals. Loved it."

Avarielle A,5,Absolutely PHENOMENAL
Cass,5,Amazing! The right combination of nostalgia and new storytelling. Will go see again. Its the NEW classic!
Brian syms,5,"A joy. I accept that Disney is doing their best to make changes and it obviously will come with a lot of backlash but Ariel at all being a woman of color is still amazing to me. If you are not one of us fantasy obsessed black kids (now black adults) you could never understand how important this film is. Or how important it will be for the future black fantasy kids, or actors or singers or dancers who one day would like to land coveted and sought after roles."

 Halle Bailey was amazing! Melissa McCarthy was fantastic! Javier Bardem amazing, very well done"

Natalie G,5,"Great story, amazing characters"
David,5,Great movie my lady and I enjoyed.
Daniel,3,Hailey definitely has star power and this will serve as a spring board for her. however the film itself was overly long for kids. the new songs were lackluster and the humor was flat. yet another underwhelming live action remake from disney
amhst,5,Absolutely loved it! Complete nostalgic moment for me to share with my children!
KellyS,5,Loved Hallie Bailey. Beautiful love story
TENISE,5,"The fact that Disney is re-imagining these classical movies with diverse cast aiding the inclusion and the storyline made me fall into my childhood fantasy as a mermaid, but this I could be the mermaid as a woman of color."
Kelly,5,Loved everything about it!
Elizabeth R,5,This movie will exceed every expectation you have for it. It is a MUST SEE. I want to watch this movie a thousand more times. The best Disney princess live action movie by far
Tamika,5,My girls loved the details of the mermaids !!!!
Aiko,5,"I turned 34 with this movie this year—grew up singing the songs in this film, had a Flounder stuffed animal  please believe me when I say that the film was worth every cent for this true blue Little Mermaid fan. If you love the '89 film and Disney in general, you will undoubtedly appreciate this live action rendition of it. I know some folx can't get past Flounder's eyes  but I loved it. 9/10. (I never give 10/10s, perfection is a construct.)"
Nikki,5,amazing re-imagining
Anecia,5,"wether this film makes a billion or not, it is still the best live action movie Disney has ever actually done justice (it deserves to make a billion). Also can we talk about how hot Prince Eric is?"
Brian,5,"As someone who remembered the animated film when I was a child, it was wonderful seeing the creative art direction with this modern live action movie. The actors and actresses were really good. Very impressed with the person playing Ariel who did an excellent job! Overall the film was way better than I thought. I enjoyed it so much. Really loved the film and the message it conveys, especially the ending. Great family film. Appears a lot of thought and care went into making this movie. Visuals were really beautiful. One of the best live action Disney films ever made, along with Aladdin. In fact I give the “Little Mermaid” a solid 10 and a huge thumbs up. It’s that good!"
Briana,5,There was nothing to dislike about this beautiful creation of art! Im so proud of Disney! Great way to step up & show diversity!! I will forever & akwTs be a fan
Adam,5,Great movie for the whole family! Melissa McCarthy was pitch perfect as Ursula!
Joy,5,"I laughed,  cried. and giggled.  All the cast members did an amazing job. Will see it again."
Tonya H,5,I loved this movie. The music and singing. The bright colors and snappy effects. The emotionalism. It was a tear jerker! I came in distracted by the fake negative reviews and came out happy and light as a feather.
Theresa B,5,I loved it! I grew up loving The Little Mermaid and this version was so good. I do think the live actions are better for adults as the 5 year old we had had trouble keeping her attention without the cartoon but I absolutely loved it!
Dana,5,It was an excellent version and Halle Bailey was a wonderful Ariel.  Prince Eric as had more depth than before and Melissa McCarthy was a great Ursula.  The diversity within the very welcomed

purrplerayne,4,Family Friendly movie!
Catherine,5,Stayed true to the original but added some twists. The music was amazing ! Her voice is just beautiful!
Fernando Ruiz,4,The movie provided the dynamics the original has. It was rich in color and dialogue. The added pieces that made the movie run pass its original run time were not necessary but certainly change the tone of the movie. Over all I enjoyed it.
Ronald,5,It’s was my favorite childhood movie
Mitesh,1,"It’s Good, Songs we’re great . Story line was same of original . It was bit predictable .. But all in all my 4 yrs daughter like it since it was first time she watched."
Tonii,4,"Beautiful story with a little suspense, action, romance, and drama. Enjoyable"
Joel,5,Melissa McCarthy is insane as Ursula. Loved watching Poor Unfortunate Souls. As for the Ariel. She's a fictional character and can be any race as its important to her character. Halle Bailey is great as well. Fun ride.
Gail,5,Awesome. Loved it. The look on my grand daughters face as i watched was priceless.
Joni,5,"I liked the movie a lot.  

The only dislike was for the parent who let their 2 kids (approx 2&3) run all over the theater and being loud."
Mary,5,Enchanting! Halle Bailey is Ariel! Jonah Hauer-King shines as Prince Eric! Every character was a joy to watch. If you love the original you are going to love this. If you’re sick of Disney live action remakes and are going to let that cloud your judgment then just don’t watch. I have nothing bad to say about this movie and I can’t wait until it’s out on Disney+!
Amber Hunt,5,I loved the singing and I loved that Halle Bailey played Ariel really well!!
Hannah,5,I love how the whole plot was the same as the original and was not changed. It was really good!

Evelio,5,Awesome as good as original
Alain,5,"It was truly an awesome experience. The film beautifully brought the enchanting underwater world to life with its stunning visuals and vibrant colors. The cast delivered fantastic performances, bringing life into the beloved characters and making them feel relatable. The music was simply enchanting, staying true to the iconic songs while adding a fresh twist. Overall, ""The Little Mermaid"" live-action adaptation was a delightful and captivating cinematic journey that did justice to the classic tale."

Kathi Kreisler,5,I liked the diversity of people in the show.  The vocals were unbelievably beautiful

Karson,5,"I enjoyed the film, took me back to my childhood. Was able to sing songs from the original score and felt like I was watching the animation again. Remake well done."
Rhonie  M,4,disappointed in the accent of the crab. a real Caribbean should have been chosen for the voice. everything else was fine

Jennifer P,4,I actually thought it was fantastic but it was missing the kiss
Jayme,4,"My expectations of Disney have been pretty low over the last few years due to their need to be woke on everything. Since the little mermaid was my absolute favorite movie as a child, I decided this would be worth trying. I was so pleasantly surprised and impressed! The characters stayed true to the story line and the small tweaks to the plot made sense. They did an excellent job with this film!"

Cheryl,4,"I liked that it was a family movie, that there was a little twist to the normal princess type shows, and the adventure was great!"
cherie s,5,LOVED IT! It did the original justice and put a slight modern day twist on it. Halle was perfect and Prince Eric wasnt too hard on the eyes either!
Lynn  J,5,A little scary in places for younger children.
Tarra B,5,I enjoyed it and will watch it again. Excellent job!!
MoniD,4,The movie was good. I liked that it stayed true to the original with just minimal changes. I don’t think that the 3D added anything to the movie
Keissy,5,Best live action Disney movie yet!
Elena,3,It was good but it's not like the cartoons that I grow up with. Good for kids my niece enjoy it and love it.
Kim G,5,"This movie was amazing! The cast is amazing, the music and songs are beautiful, the scenes are gorgeous. It hit all of the nostalgic points of the animated version but it was so easy to feel the emotions with the characters in this version. It was fun, emotional, and captivating!"
Taisha,4,Movie was Great me and my daughter enjoyed it a lot . The prices of the tickets however was a little over priced.

Danielle,5,"This is a Great Movie, a must see in 3D"
nikoletaylor,5,Absolutely amazing! Love every moment of this movie and gave me childhood memories of watching this as a little girl. Love seeing the representation shown in Ariel Im a BIG fan! 10/10 highly recommend
Bridgette,5,This movie was the most beautiful experience I have ever endured. I love that it mostly stayed true to the original with a couple of new AMAZING songs. Everyone giving it negative reviews is simply hating and doesn't know good cinema. Great job to the entire cast. This film was magic on a screen.
Google,5,The movie was amazing. I really enjoyed seeing the characters bring the story to life. This is my daughters new favorite movie.
Jairo,5,A classic retold for our generation.
CJJ,5,What a movie!! A must see.
Dylan,0,"Had to get a refund the constant screaming along with my chair being continuously kicked was a major setback. I get it it’s a family movie, but parents should show their kids what respect looks like I wanted to enjoy the movie hopefully when I see you at 10:30 Monday night it’ll be a better experience and a different experience at that"
Elizabeth,4,I love the mermaid I feel that it completed the story.
Rocky,5,The movie was awesome do much action it felt like I was in the movie

Alice C,5,Beautiful singing - well made film - grandkids and grandparents enjoyed!!
Brandy,5,"I'm not going to lie. I went into this movie with low expectations but was definitely surprised. it was beautifully shot, and Halle was fantastic. The fact that it kept my 3 year old's attention is enough reason to give it 5 stars."
Bobbie Marie,4,"We loved it and thought they did a great job explaining a bit more about the historical context of the island and Eric's background. 
Everyone did a spectacular job in their roles, especially Melissa McCarthy as Ursela. Easily one of my favorite scenes was Unfortunate Souls! 
Some spots felt rushed, but overall we really enjoyed it!"
Darby,0,"I was really disappointed with this movie. As a fan of the original Little Mermaid since I was a child there differences were too many. The added songs were unnecessary, the changing words of some songs was unnecessary and some stuff was left out, like the chefs song and Vanessas song. Also, flounder wasnt in the movie as much as he originally was. Overall I was disappointed. I would not see it again and I will not be purchasing it on dvd."
Patricia,5,The new remake has a more meaningful direction of where Ariel is and where she is going. It also shows why some mermaids do not like humans. Everything that was lacking in the original is present in the remake.  Halle Bailey was PERFECT and AMAZING as Ariel! This is now my only favorite movie
Laura W,5,"I was excited to see this movie and it did not disappoint. The visuals were great, of course the storyline was great and stuck very close to the original. The characters were funny, music was wonderful and it even brought a tear to my eye, just like the original. Wonderfully done!!!"
Ray G,0,Nice victuals but Stick with the original
Chels,5,"if I could leave a 10/10 I would, this movie was amazing !!"
Chelsey Winship,3,"New songs werent a grand, they gave a new feel to the movie but removed that nostalgic feel so it constantly felt back and forth in the movie. They added some new things that were great, jokes were wonderful but some things were removed that really made the original, (Like Ursulas song) and it just kinda made it feel more off and less of a reason for the things Ariel wanted. Halle did amazing with the singing, her acting was good. Melissa was to die for! She killed it as Ursula."
Rosario,5,Halle Bailey is so beautiful and her amazing voice and emoting was perfect. Love love love.
Kristelle,5,Its a must see! I loved everything about it. Halle was the perfect mermaid. Would definitely see it again!
Zeidi,3,It was okay but not to watch again…it was decent but I stay with the original one

tally,5,AMAZING! perfectly like the original
Peggy,2,It was long and boring
Erin M,5,Fantastic adaptation! I thought it was so well done. The new songs are wonderful and not overdone. I think the actress playing Ariel did a fantastic job playing the naivety of Ariel and her voice was solid!
Nikki,5,Exceeded my expectations.
Dianne,5,Acting was great. Singing was fabulous.
Eric,4,"I went in with negative thoughts and left the cinema with joy & amazed at the film. Its a great family movie, definitely recommend."
Andre,5,"I didnt get to watch it through fandango due to computer glitch but I have to get my review in. HALLE BAILEY NAILED THIS & INCLUDING CAST & PRODUCTION! As I looked around I, it was clear all ages, sex & races thoroughly enjoyed this make on The Little Mermaid. A must see! I will see it AGAIN & maybe AGAIN!"
Rager,5,Superb! Best Ariel Ever!!!!!
Ayanna,5,Absolutely AMAZING!!!!!!!
Rachael,4,"Beautifully done! The rhythmic music. The vivid colors. The message. All well received from our family that includes two sons, ages 12 and 15, the latter of whom was embarrassed to go. It was satisfying to see that he was not the only teen male there and to watch him smile and move to the music. The main male character doesnt have the best singing voice. The only suggestion is to consider kids ages, as the little ones under five seem to need several breaks. The movie is long and there are tons of previews We look forward to seeing in again once it is available on Disney plus. Enjoy!"
Kimberly,5,"This reimagining is so good! I loved every minute. Sebastians shaky accent and the new Scuttle song aside, this is the best remake yet!"
Myles S,5,A slight remix from the original and it was great to see the representation
mc,3,"Perfectly enjoyable. You can easily nitpick this movie to death and of course its not the original, but it is serviceable and inoffensive. Its fine and is enjoyable for what it is."
Sonia,5,So many unexpected moments in this movie.  The diversity of the entire cast made this film relatable to all.  Enjoyed everything about this remake.
Jairo G,3,Its a bit too long for kids
Jana,5,"Nothing to dislike about the movie.  It was fantastic from beginning to end.  Although, Ursula may be a little scary for children."
Kevin,5,Just awesome!  Even some of the dads were brought to tears.
Jack,4,"I loved this movie and wasn't expecting to. Halle's singing was amazing and it may be Melissa McCarthy's best acting ever and her performance of Poor Unfortunate Souls was delicious. Daveed Diggs, Akwafina, and Javier Bardem were all terrific."
Britney,5,"Phenomenal movie from start to finish ! Must See! 5 stars! 10/10! The sound track, the story, the casting, the colors. Everything. Cant wait to watch it again"
Telvia,5,I loved it!!! Excellent Job Disney!
Taneisha,5,My daughter enjoyed it from the beginning to the end.  She sang along with the songs.  It's the first movie she stayed awake for the whole thing.

J,5,Exceeded my expectations. Well done.
Hannah P,5,The story and songs  are fantastic.

Barbara T,5,I loved it!! Can’t wait to see it again!!
Cecilia,5,Wonderful story line as only Disney can.nn
Chrissy  C,5,"The Little Mermaid is fabulous. My favorite characters were Javier Bardem and Melissa McCarthy. Halle’s voice is absolutely incredible. Her and Eric are really good together. All the songs were amazing. Especially the new Lin Manuel one.

Fantastic film!"

Mrs. Smith,5,soooo cute! loved it
Chris,5,"Beautiful visuals! Halle Bailey was a star and is so captivating throughout. Really enjoyed the updated Under the Sea! My only critique is that the movie truly is too dark in some scenes. I could hardly make out details in certain sequences. But despite this, the movie is a 10/10."
Loretta,4,"It liked that it was the same as the original, just live actors.  The music was very good and I loved the under ocean scenes"
Teresa P,5,It was a great movie.  I liked it better than the other live action remakes of Disney animated movies.
Jeannette A,5,The whole family loved it!
trina,5,DEFINITELY RECOMMEND!!!!
Angela,5,Absolutely loved it! Was skeptical only because it's my favorite Disney movie since I was a kid and some of the other live action movies aren't great but this exceeded my expectation in every way. Even my teenage son who I practically begged to go (so I didn't have to go alone )said he really enjoyed it so that's saying something
Tabitha,5,I've waited my entire life for this live action. I was amazing

Joi R,5,"The animations, the music and the actors were all phenomenal"
Mr. Armstrong,5,Graphics are amazing!! Great movie 😊
B.E.,4,"Delightful,captivating and splendid,though it could have cut a little time off it’s over 2+ hour runtime,The Little Mermaid(2023) is one of,if not the best of Disney’s live-action retellings.From the performances(Especially from Halle Bailey (Ariel) ,Melissa McCarthy (Ursula),Daveed Diggs (Sebastian),Jacob Tremblay (Flounder),Awkwafina (Skuttle),Jonah Hauer-King (Prince Eric),Javier Bardem(King Triton) among many) to the musical sequences(sans for one particular rap that was added in😒)to the musical score(from both the returning/legendary Alan Menken joined by the great Lin-Manuel Miranda) to the wonderful visuals to even a certain little cameo😉,you will be forever grateful to have been part of this world,even if it will not fully change your opinion of the 1989 original,same for me.Get ready for a wonderful/amazing journey under the sea!🧜‍♀️🐠🦀🔱"
Jonathan,5,"A wonderful love letter to the original that fleshes out the world of the Little Mermaid beautifully. Melissa McCarthy was wonderful as Ursula and brought a fun energy to the character. My only gripe is she didnt laugh enough! But when she did it was perfect. Halley Bailey was perfection as Ariel, her voice I enchanting her performance was just outstanding. This is a must see for new and old Little Mermaid fans alike."
Elexus,5,Beautiful movie. I’ll be back to see it again!
Armani G,5,"I really liked the representation that Halle Bailey portrayed. And all the other actors and actresses. Love the cinematography of the whole movie, it is as really colourful and vibrant!!! The plot made sense and the ending was fitting. It connected really well towards the original one. Jonah as prince Eric blew me away. Simone Ashley as Indira was just drop dead gorgeous, along with all the daughters of Triton. Sebastian, Flounder and Scuttle were comical to say the least (I had a good laugh) and to sum it up, The Little Mermaid is not some woke movie that haters love to say, it’s honourable representation, beautiful music, talented acting and good quality visuals that will have you amazed. Halle Bailey has truly become one of my fav actresses of all time and I think she’s onto the hall of fame and many accolades such as a Grammy, Oscar and Academy. Also I noticed Jodi Benson who voiced Ariel in the animated version and it was a breath of fresh air to see her. Only one thing annoyed me well not annoyed but was sad to me is the lack of scenes of the sisters, really would’ve been nice to see more of them and more of Atlantica. Highly recommend this movie be watched by anyone an any age and you’ll be moved and happy once it over. It’s a classic reimagined in the BEST way!!! 3"
Ashley,5,I really loved this movie. I love how it was true to the original.
Shameka O,5,Beautifully written. Perfect adaptation of the original.
Lorelei R,4,"Such a beautiful Disney movie, saw in 3D and it was the absolute best"

Omar D,4,Good movie for kids.
Anaria,5,Loved every moment of it.

BT,5,This was a great movie and I love seeing the diversity in the movie and in the movie theater. It shows that children are just loving humans.

Joey,4,"Pretty good movie, watched it with my gf. If you love disney you will love this movie."

Vanessa,5,"It was a beautiful movie. The colors, depictions and characters were all better than I could have imagined. I definitely recommend seeing it in 3D."
Ashelee,4,Not much changed from the cartoon. But I loved this and my 4 year olds loved it as well

patricia,5,"Very inclusive, like todays world"
Shirley,4,"I was surprised at how much I did like it.  The acting was great, the cast worked but it just wasnt the same."
Tammy R,4,It followed very closely to the original movie but it was definitely modernized a bit with current personalities. It was a bit “ dark” in some scenes and may be a little frightening to very young children. But as an adult that grew up loving Disney Princesses….it’s a hit!
Jessica,5,Better than the original!!!
Lisa  O,4,Loved it! I didn't think that I would but I absolutely loved it!
Virginia,5,Loved 😍 the little mermaid.  They all did a wonderful job.
floatsam&jetsam,5,"Honestly it was probably more fun to watch than the original. The music was amazing, the little animated characters were very funny and fun to watch, the story was easy to follow and two hours did not feel like enough time because it made you want even more. I recommend it to everyone even those who are skeptical, I promise you will come out loving it"
Amanda,4,I loved the movie. The water scenes were a little dark. The little changes did not take away from the story at all. And Melissa McCarthy did excellent as Ursula!
Shelia,5,"Very well done, the characters very diverse which showed the true meaning of love with a balance of a touch of evil."
Annissa,5,I really enjoyed the animation coming to life and the storyline. It is a must see for all ages...teaches parents to listen more to their children rather than imposing their views on them.
Lulu,5,The whole movie was wonderful
Niomi B.,5,"Loved the movie. A nostalgic, romantic musical. Halle’s high note bust the movie theatre speakers. The entire cast did a great job. Disney always has hidden messages. Overall a great experience, especially in IMAX. My inner child is happy!"
FS,2,"The drama of the movie was not engaging, if your child is 6 yrs or younger not a good movie. Wait until you can see it at home."
Stephanie,3,Melissa McCarthy was an excellent Ursula.
Shay,5,Instantly transported me to my childhood. Loved everything!! (except Flounder was the wrong shade of yellow!)
HENRY B,5,"Normally I avoid these “children’s” movies for obvious reasons however, I truly wanted to support this film with such a Fantastic Cast! Boy I’m Glad I did - it’s a Remarkable & Very Entertaining Movie with Great Musical Numbers by the Phenomenon, Halle Bailey! Melissa McCarthy plays the Sea Witch to Perfection!👍🏽🙌🏾👏🏽"
Veronica,5,I thought they stayed pretty true to the original. A few changes and added songs. Each character played a great part. I thought Ariel and Sebastian were great. Great movie

Elizabeth L,5,"absolutely LOVED this movie...
visually STUNNING..."
Tiffany,5,"I would give it 10 stars if I could. A wonderful remake of the Disney Classic. I sang along and recited lines like I was 5 again. I love how they made it multicultural unlike the orginal cartoon version. My daughter loved every moment as well though Ursula scared her a bit as she did I at the age of 5. She wanted to sit watch it all over again (we did not),  so I guess it didnt scare her too much."
joseph cook,4,This was a good movie with laughs and vivid visuals. Halle voice is so beautiful. The cast was good too. B+

Google,5,I loved the movie. The characters they selected and everything. I would definitely recommend people to go see it.
Aaron L,4,"The Little Mermaid was breathtaking and magnificent. Halle Bailey was magnificent as Ariel. I mean, her voice gave off a lot of emotion from me. And Ursula, the Sea Witch gave a great performance, especially during her “Poor Unfortunate Souls” number. And Prince Eric, the heartthrob was just perfect as a young prince who was an adventurer by trade. Overall, The Little Mermaid was amazing, an incredible remake and reimagining of a beloved Disney classic."

Travis S,5,Great storyline and outstanding acting..

SEAN L,4,The 4DX experience was awesome and some of the movie felt fresh.
Qiana,5,What a beautiful romantic love story with some comedy 😍 that's the movie 🍿🎥 that I love but it's more towards older children/Adults not for the little kiddo's #BlackMermaid u rock gurl👍🏾
Bre,5,Halle was amazing! The casting was perfect! The bird was hilarious! Outstanding production!
Carigon,0,So different then the original I understand changing a little but that was far from it. Very disappointing. The actors was every well picked to fit the characters but changed so many details.
LaWanna  G,5,"Movie was awesome, it's a must see! I liked the idea, that the storyline was practically the same as the animated version, along with a few extras. I'm extremely pleased with the fact that Disney incorporated a very diverse group of people for the making of this film. It was very well put together, and Hailey Bailey did an amazing job in playing her role as Ariel."
Sheena B,5,"Loved the movie. Sebastian was a little mild in the beginning, but I gee to like him. Halle nailed Ariel. Melissa also nailed Ursula. This is the first Disney live action movie I actually enjoyed. You should definitely check it out."
laquay,5,Awesome graphics this was really good
Ayana,5,EXCELLENT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Zachary M,4,"The movie works really well when it takes its notes from the animated film (and Andersen fairy-tale) that inspired it instead of the Buzzfeed comment section. There's not a weak link among the cast, least of all the effervescent Halle Bailey."
Tonya L,5,Great movie. A must see.
Eugene,5,"Great story, terrific cast, perfect timing. And music..."
Loved It!,5,"Dont Listen To These Fools When They Say It Wasn’t Good… I Actually Liked It , But What Mostly Mattered Is Seeing My Daughter Enjoy The Whole Movie With Excitement,!!!! She Didnt Care That The Characters Didn’t Look Like The Originals, She Still Understood Who Was Who. I Give It A Solid 10"
Tamel H,5,Nostalgic at its finest
Donna W,5,We loved it!!!  I totally got chills watching my favorite Disney movie turned into live action.  BRAVO!

Dave,5,"3D was very enjoyable.  Frankly, this was maybe the 2nd time we have been to the theatre since the pandemic.
Very enjoyable experience.  A feel good movie made it even better."
Moni,5,"Absolutely incredible music, new songs, stunning colors and breathtaking visuals! Loved it! One of my favorite live-actions so far. Could have done without the one rap song though.."
Sandra H,5,"After having to get over the fact that Halle Berry was not in it and it was Halle Bailey, I really enjoyed it. Melissa McCarthy was awesome. Great love story and I cried."
Nancy B,3,Loved the colors... a bit too scary for a 4-year-old though. I forgot about Ursula although she did a fabulous job.
Nijalyn,5,The movie was absolutely amazing! Its so beautiful that my daughter was able to see a mermaid that looked like her!
Tarshell Cherie,5,Oh the Little 🧜🏾‍♀️ #Mermaid was everything. Hailee is the absolute best Ariel I've seen and her voice is so captivating.  #welldonedisney

Kat,5,This movie was amazing! I loved it! Disney...5 stars!❤️
Nathan,5,My friend and I loved it.
Megan,3,"WellI read a ton of reviews before going to see itIm not so sure what all the negative criticism is. I mean is it the original, gosh no! However I followed the whole movie as if I was watching the cartoon. Theres a few new scenes and some left out, but for the most part it sticks pretty closely to the original. I thought Sebastian missed the mark. He couldve been so funny, but the lines were delivered so boringly. Ariel was perfectly fine. Beautiful voice. Ursula was great. I dont know. Would I see it again? No. But glad I saw it, and saw it in the theater"
Lydia,4,I missed my flamingos.
JW,5,Great movie and Halle Bailey was fantastic! So nice to see a Disney movie with a leading actress who is representing women of color. Well done!
Karen D,5,"The movie was very good. It followed the original version. Great job, everyone!"
rick,5,Halle Bailey is phenomenal as Ariel.  Her voice is incredible.  Great movie!
Abigail,5,We absolutely loved it!
Stephanie M,3,"Hallie has an amazing voice. Cute movie, great special effects but not a fan of the new songs added. Where where was Chef Louis??!!!!! No Le Poisson?!!!! WHAT! Ruined it for me. Shouldn’t have cut one of the most beloved scene from The Little Mermaid. 👎🏼👎🏼"
Norma,4,Beautiful in 3D with the ocean scenes
Gemma Lou Reyes,5,Super Happy to watch Little Mermaid!.. I really love Disney Movies!
Mimi,4,A little boring toward the middle but then it picks up again
Darby Jaynes,5,"Im always skeptical of these remakes. Especially such a beloved movie. But if you go into this with an open mind I think its one that can be enjoyed by old and new fans alike. I felt it stayed true to the story, and the characters were great. For those who are giving this movie poor reviews, I feel like theyre probably the same ones that were upset as soon as they saw the movie poster."
Nikki S,5,The movie was very good my grown self cried several times a must see Halle did amazing
Junell,5,"Amazing! Kept both kids engrossed for 2+ hours. Actors were extremely talented, costumes were spot on, and the singing was magical."
Carol,5,I thought it was very well done. especially terrific in 3D.
Tiffany,5,Loved the movie! It was great to hear the classics!
Wendy Romero,4,Didnt really like the new song added and I wish they would have included the part on how Ariel is the star of the concerts
Henry L,5,"Excellent remake, I did not know what to expect but it was better than the original ."
William,5,It was fantastic my family loved it
Kimberly,5,It was better than the og! Some things were taken out but the things that were added were even better! But will say it was 90% true to the og
Maryah,5,It was absolutely amazing!!! I love Halle
ANGELA W,5,"Just Amazing!! Growing up with the Little Mermaid this movie was a wonderful nod to the original while giving it a modern spin that every little princess can relate to and see herself as one of King Tritons daughters :) Halle is stunning and Sebastian and Scuttle will make you laugh out loud! You may even shed a tear by the end. Just simply wonderful Disney Magic, can’t wait to see it again :)"
Terrence L,3,"I went in the theater with low expectations, and I came away from the movie pleasantly surprised.  I think Halle Bailey did a good job playing Ariel.  And she sang the songs very well.  God bless and may he put her on the right path."
Renee D,4,Thoroughly enjoyed the movie
Iliyah Berry,5,I absolutely enjoyed this movie!! It was even better in 3D. Will definitely go see it again.
Aycocks8287 L,5,Very cute! Great casting. Great music. It is lengthy!! 2 1/2 hours and 30 minute preview is a long time for kids. The previews did contain a little language .. overall loved it. Ursula was a bit scary and may be too much  for some younger viewers. We talked about it a lot beforehand and throughout.  I love this adaptation
ZACHARY H,5,awesome. Halle Bailey is awesome so is Melissa McCarthy
amy,4,"The family loved it! If you’re a fan of the original, this one won’t disappoint but will perhaps surprise. :)"

Christine,5,"Great movie, love the computer animation."
Rushawna,5,Loved it. It was amazing Halle Bailey is an amazing Ariel and the cast I loved as well. Love the ending too.
Marilyn,5,The movie was SPECTACULAR
Valerie,5,"I took my 13 year old grandaughter because she asked to go.  We both had seen the movie numerous, numerous times when she was little.  To the point where we both knew all the words.  I did not expect to like this movie since I was so entrenched with the one when she was little.  We both really enjoyed it!  They made just enough changes in this movie to make it interesting yet kept it close enough to the original to feel comfortable with it.  The movie was awesome.  I like that they fleshed our Prince Eric's character.  I felt myself feeling getting involved with the story more than I did previously.  It was great!"
Claire,4,Thought it was really fun! Did not like the Scuttle Butt song. Otherwise - a great re-imagining of this classic that both my Husband and I saw in college. It was fun to take both our 16 and 19 yr. olds with us for the journey.
Kim,5,This was the first movie I ever saw in theaters when I was 7 years old. I have been so excited to see this since I heard it was going to be made! The beginning and end gave me cold chills. I dont think they could have found a more PERFECT Eric!! I didnt like that they changed some names-like of her sisters and they left out a few scenes that I LOVED like the chef making crab but those are literally my only complaints. The girl that played Ariels voice is absolutely perfect! Melissa McCarthy even plays a good villain!
Kat R,5,Halle did what needed to be done 🥹👏🏽👏🏽 Amazing cast . Super funny while so warming
Jade,4,"The movie was fantastic. Some of the comic relief was lost with the phrasing changes, but it was still great. Halle Bailey is the perfect Little Mermaid! I can't give it 5 stars because they cut my favorite scene!"
T. Shaheed,5,The BEST live-action Disney remake TO DATE! It took me back to my childhood and then some. Everybody absolutely killed their performances but Halle Bailey truly embodies and is our Princess Ariel. 🥹🧜🏽‍♀️♥️ Melissa McCarthy ATE as Ursula! An absolute MUST SEE! My inner child was jumping for joy! Cried multiple times… will watch again and again and again!
Vanessa,5,I had low expectations for a live adaptation but this one was FANTASTIC.
Latoia,5,Beautiful movie💐💐💐

Melissa Suggs,5,I think I enjoyed  it more than my granddaughter...She's  a fan of the original....Definitely  a great movie  ...Hailie's voice is powerful...Brought a tear to my eye several  times throughout the film
Geekygirl Revolution,5,"They couldn't have picked a better person to be Arielle.  Halle truly embodied Arielle's soul!  The movie was breathtaking!  I loved every minute!
The music was also amazing!"
K. Davis-Allen,5,The kiss the girl scene.
SA1104,2,The visual effects were very impressive watching the movie in Real 3D but overall the movie is not something I would want to watch again on a television. My daughter said the same thing after we left the theater.
Desiree,4,"Although it may not have what I grew up watching, I really enjoyed it. What made me love it even more was the joy and pride it brought my girls watching it. I already had to find the doll for my youngest ( at Target if anyone wants to know)"
kristen,5,the singing was absolutely amazing! we loved Sebastian so much! Hilarious!

Gwendolyn Carter,5,This movie was amazing  Halle Bailey did her thing in this movie
Melissa C,4,It was so cute! I loved it and so did my Granddaughter
CLS,5,The movie was great. Loved the underwater scenes and activity. Adults and teens should enjoy this probably more than younger children.
LA,5,Hailey was indeed a princess. I was happy to see that there were deviations from the original make. Most likable was Ariel's family--seen in every race/color. This is one of Disney's best live-action remakes I've ever seen.

Much better character building, better representation of the geographic locale, great diverse casting choices, fabulous new songs, beautiful graphics, and fantastic story. The only thing I didnt love was casting of Ursula not that it was terrible but I think they could have gone a better direction with her. Highly recommend this movie!!"
Google,4,"The Little Mermaid was the first Disney movie I saw when I was a kid, and I hated it. This film is visually stunning and has more heart than the original. I found the storyline more compelling, the conflict more enthralling, and the characters more engaging. That said, this felt like Disney 2020. Very shiny, but would have fallen flat if it werent for the Javier Bardem and Melissa McCarthy delivering performances that were the opposite of Disneys soulless machine."
Ashley H,5,Loved it! Stuck to the script and delivered!
Stepdadrew,4,"I enjoyed it, but more importantly the children did too."

Ellen,5,I thought it was excellent!. Well done Disney!

Towanna,5,I loved the movie. Especially the closing scene
Eric,5,Great movie with our daughter!
Rina,5,Such an absolute joy to watch! A must see film!
Mike C,3,"Not too much was different from the original animated movie. They added a few new songs, adapted the older ones only a minuscule of ways. Visually stunning underwater settings. It seems they changed from a black sea region to Caribbean?"
Google,0,"I recently watched the new Little Mermaid movie, and unfortunately, I was extremely disappointed. The characters were not relatable at all, and the movie lacked any original content that was different from the original movie. 

Firstly, the characters in the movie were unrelatable and lacked depth. The lead character, Ariel, was portrayed as an overly emotional and naive character who seemed to be constantly chasing after Prince Eric. Her character lacked any real growth or development, and it felt like she was simply going through the motions of the original movie without any real substance. 

Secondly, the movie lacked any original content that set it apart from the original movie. The storyline was virtually the same as the original, with no real twists or turns that made it unique or interesting. It felt like the filmmakers were simply trying to cash in on the success of the original movie without putting any real effort into creating something new and exciting.

Overall, I was extremely disappointed with the new Little Mermaid movie. The characters were not relatable, and the movie lacked any original content that would have made it stand out from the original. If you are a fan of the original movie, I would not recommend wasting your time watching this lackluster remake."
Tiffany,4,That it was the same basis from the original story but with human  emotions to draw in more connectivity. Only down side is that Sebastian was not the correct animal and that the musical scene under the sea was not Performed in the same manner.
Mia,5,the BEST live action disney princess movie. This was so cute i cried so many times. I cant wait watch it again
Mari,5,Such a great remake! Haile did amazing in her debut movie
Janice,4,This movie was very good! It brought joy to the kids and adults in my family and we all thoroughly enjoyed it together.
Anonymous,4,"It was better than I thought, and I don't care much for original Disney Little Mermaid movie."
betty,5,good movie!! I enjoy it. 👌
Lisa,5,Very nice update to the classic.
kathy,5,I loved the diversity in the movie. Made every little girl believe they can be a mermaid
Alyssa,1,The movie was average songs to slow
Emily,5,Excellent! Two thumbs up!!
Panther,5,The movie is amazing! It’s a must see💙 Everyone played their part. 10/10 would recommend
William  W,5,love the movie and the music
Jenr,5,Loved they kept the storyline with such beautiful scenes in and out the water. The cast was phenomenal
Melissa,5,This movie was wonderful. The whole cast is beautiful and handsome. I love seeing such unity and love.
Aisley R,5,"The Little Mermaid  was a MASTERPIECE and we LOVED it so much! In my opinion, this is, by far, Disney's best live adaptation to date. We can't wait to see it again. I was so excited to see Halle Bailey as Ariel and she surpassed allll of my expectations. She was absolutely perfect. The whole cast was. They truly found the best way to honor the original film while adding plot and film aspects that enhance the film rather than cluttering it or taking away from the essence of the original. My ONLY complaint was that I didn't like the Scuttlebutt song and I didn't feel like it fit into the rest of the film. But it wasn't a big enough deal to tarnish my opinion of the film overall."
Matt B,5,"Halle Bailey is the perfect Ariel. Loved this movie when I was a kid, loved it now. A+"
Kanie K,5,"The movie was pretty good from the images to the songs to the plotline, it had plenty of moral lessons people could take to heart. Sometimes parents just need to listen, don't be selfish, and discriminate against the humans and mermaids! ( talking about the mother). I like the songs it was so fun to sing especially the rap segment. Sabastian was so hilarious with the seagull. 

Halle plaid her character well, she was so cute and talented. She may not look like the original but you have to understand what Disney was going for. The sisters are all from seven seas, in the cartoon they lived on some type of island, and Sebastian being a Jamaican crab was a hint of what kind of island they lived on. So why not go to the Caribbean or something?  So it made sense why they would make Ariel be from the Island. Another thing some black people have ginger hair and blond hair, learn your facts. Lastly, I was hoping Ariel's sisters would have another line, like them searching for her and finding her depressed after finding out about the prince. All in all, it was a good movie, they all did well"
Jasmina,5,Watched it twice already!!
onjenae w,5,This adaptation revamped the story so beautifully every one was phenomenal ! GO HALLE
T,5,I was never a big fan of the cartoon movie growing up much but this live action version was phenomenal! The way they were able to bring this to life was so amazing and I want to see it again. Bravo! Halle Bailey and Melissa McCartney did the thing!
Lauren,5,It was absolutely amazing!!! Even better than expected!
Desi,5,She did an amazing job 🙌🏿🙌🏿🙌🏿
ASYA,5,"Halle was stunning as Ariel she really made it her own. The whole cast was really great! I honestly couldn’t keep my eyes off of her. I cried. There were a few things like the wedding and the dress choices that were missed for me, however my daughter and her friends loved it. I love the diversity of the sea kingdom it was beautiful a true representation of the world. I really can’t wait to see the behind the scenes because this movie is stunning. Bravo 🎉 Disney."
Danielle,5,It was so much better than I expected!!! I’m ABSOLUTELY going to see it again!
Andrea,5,"Loved it! Love the new writing, new songs, new jokes."
Maroco,5,A must see…great movie for the family !!!
Emmanuel J,4,Way better than the Lion King Remake. The underwater effects could've been borrowed from James Cameron
Jose I,5,Disney did a great job in bringing The Little Mermaid to life. Great cast and beautiful colors and scenery. The only thing I could have lived without is the Prince's solo song.
NATHALIE,5,amazing amazing amazing!!!!!!
Marie-France,5,Absolutely beautiful and fun!! Halle truly was the best pick for the role of Ariel.
Matthew Edwards,4,"The music was beautiful, and the visuals were very nice, if little dark. Halle Baily is lovely as Ariel and Melissa Mcarthy does amazing as Ursula."
Sindy,0,Wish this film would have kept the script original. Very rough to sit through. Come on Disney! Do better! Very disappointing.
Carol,5,The best live action Disney movie depiction I have ever seen!!
Chris Nick and Mama,5,I liked when Scuttle said Bow Chicka Wow Wow and when Ariel was looking at the crystal mermaid. The sound track is still a gem and new songs too! Captivating and wonderful.
Azariah Madej,5,"Ive always loved the little mermaid and was worried about the changes but the movie was wonderful! Halle Baileys voice was amazing, I love how they made it more realistic and gave more to the story!"
Ashanti M,5,Amazing. Halle did her thing!
DONNA S,5,Great funny movie for everyone
Nicole S,5,"I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of this remake. Acting was great, singing was on point. The humor from Sebastian was spot on. Although it was a bit jarring to see Flounder & Sebastian more “realistic” vs the catoon version, it was still great! Halle Bailey acted very well & Melissa McCarthy did just as well too! Great casting!"
Shanasty,4,"A genuinely good family family. I thiblnk there were some boring moments to my son but dafinitely some enjoyable moments too! Some things I wish they hadn't changed and some changes I thought made the movie better. I did not care for the actor who played King Triton, no offense to him, he is probably an excellent actor, just not someone I enjoyed playing the character. Halle Bailey was an excellent choice for Ariel. She played the role exceedingly well. Aqua as Skuttle was....an interesting choice. There were ups and downs but I would say she did alright to entertain. Made my son laugh. Sebastian's voice could have used more emotion within his dialogue when it was needed....you can't see much emotion with a real crab...but he could have showed it more in his voice somehow. Wasn't a fan with Ariel steering the ship at the end instead of Eric. All the the musical portions of the movie were amazing!!!! I would have liked to see more sea animals for Under the Sea but aside from that it was great!! The Little Mermaid, animated version, has been my all time favorite since I was a little girl so this is just my critique coming out due to it being a favorite with all the changes. If you are a true fan of the previous movie, I suggest seeing it. I had my doubts due to people's comments and predictions before but after seeing it, let's just say the pros outweigh the cons for this live action movie remake."
Zach M,5,"Halle Bailey is a growing young actress who is perfect for the roll, which is only the start of her career."
Angelica,3,It was a cute movie but didnt really like how they changed some essential parts towards the end in my opinion. Will watch again though when it comes to Disney+
Rachel,5,My favorite Disney live action movie so far! Halle Bailey made the perfect Ariel.
Patricia,4,I loved the movie cause my 6 yr old granddaughter had a grin from ear to ear the whole time.
Ashley,5,"It was fantastic. I loved the additions they made to the original. At the same time, they did the OG proud!!! Everyone should go see this."
Rich P,5,"At least as good as, or better than, the original animated version in all respects. Only significant shortcoming was the casting of Javier Bardem as Triton."
Facebook U,3,Got week at the end. Could have found a better actor for king Trident. Several changes from the original classic.
Little Mermaid Fail,1,Bad acting and the movie flow seemed forced
Clara,5,"Loved the new version, songs, voices, actors were all incredible!"
Delaine,5,"The movie was flawless, we absolutely loved it"
James,4,Very lovely film had new elements with a nod to the classic of course. Very amazing would watch again
liz,5,"This Disney re-make is delightful.  I loved the way people of all races were portrayed.  Ariel couldn't have been better.  It is a little scary for little kids, but older kids will love it.  The cast was incredible and we thoroughly enjoyed it."
the hottest mermaid alive(besides ariel),5,I LOVED IT! It was such a beautiful movie like omgggggg
Shalonda,5,Enjoyed the singing and the ending made me cry
kellie,5,Movie was AMAZING I CANT WAIT TO SEE IT AGAIN!
Antoinette,5,Amazing!!! My childhood is complete!!
Stefanie,5,The kids and I loved it! We saw it in 3D! I love that they kept a lot of the original songs!
Bradford,5,I the differences they made to the story in this updated version of the movie separate from the exciting diversity! Very enjoyable!
The Little Mermaid (2023),5,"kids loved it. The people on  theater yelled, and clapped when it was over. kids were quiet and watching the whole movie!"
Chrissy,3,It was a little rushed
Alisha C.,5,I loved everything about this movie! So sad people are basing their reviews off the color of her skin! Welcome to ameriKKKa
Maleah J,4,"there were parts that were amazing, the colors, the animation on point. there were parts that were a little clumsy, the interaction of actors and live action. overall, good job."
Mirelsa C,5,I love the whole movie. It was beautiful! They chose the right girl to play Ariel. I cant wait to watch it again.
ChanV,5,"I considered myself a hardcore little mermaid and Ursula fan. Going in I was kinda nervous that they might ruin the classic like some of previous remakes, instead i was blown away. From the singing, new add-on songs/scenes/characters’ background to the parts/details that they cut of from the original, making this the best live action adaptation yet. Every decision to include or exclude certain elements from the original was carefully thought-out, it doesn’t take away the beauty of the original story and it doesn’t overbear/bore like if it was taken frame by frame from the original. Halle is a solid singer/actor “period”. Her performance smacked a lot of rotten eggs on haters’ head. People keep picking/mocking on the part where she sing the word “FREE”, completely blinded by that add-on style of singing/dialogue, they seemed to not understand why it would make sense to keep that cut of the song and missed the other of wonderful things she implemented throughout the song. Melissa’s Ursula was chef-kiss. Jonah was perfect as a prince should. The whole cast was wonderful. I think people do not give this Sebastian enough credit, sure the animated/realistic crab could be a little better, but Daveed’s performance is definitely up there for me. Lastly, if you are going in just to look for something to hate about this film, you gonna hate it, regardless of the other million things they did right, so be open-mind and Hope you enjoy it as much as i did!"
ElissaE,5,It was better then I thought it would be. We loved the movie.
hycrew,4,"Very colorful, stunning visuals. Despite similar story, it wasnt a shot by shot remake. Melissa McArthys acting as Ursula was really good. 
Sebastian was super cute.All the voices were really similar  to the ones from the animated Little Mermaid."
Donetra,5,I enjoyed the whole movie! Seeing it in 3d was the absolute best
Sasha g,5,Amazing live action. Updated but still true to the original story.
Pamela,5,"The Movie was Great! Hailey done a great job! All of the Characters were great. I like the plot, Disney done a great job. Definitely a must see and a movie you want  to have in your favorites collection."
Pearl,5,"If you loved the original animated movie, you will love, love, love this version.  Little Mermaid was the first movie I took my daughter to see. she was only 2. Little Mermaid has always been her favorite movie...now X2."
Nirline,5,"I love everything about it, my children enjoy it. The actors/actresses were awesome. I like her dated with the prince. This version of The Little Mermaid takes all the awesome moments, dialogue, and songs from the original and adds a modern flavor to it. Even the new songs were great, with the Scuttle song in the style of Lin-Manuel Miranda being a nice, entertaining surprise. The pacing was perfect and it knew exactly how much time to spend on each part of the story, not overextending at all. It understands comedic timing so well, and the casting choices for Ursula and Sebastian were genius. This version of Sebastian was top tier and Melissa McCarthy brings her all. Hayle Bailey was awesome as always."
Hans C,0,Such a disappointment.
prettynikki,5,Loved this movie. Didn't think I would say this but it's better than the original.
jambrownin,3,It was whitewashed and they didn’t have chemistry.   The little mermaid and Úrsula were great!
Eddy,5,"This was such a great production! So far the best Disney live action, and the actors were on point! Halle Bailey is a queen, she is so perfect for Ariel. I will be rewatching this movie"
Gerardo,0,"It felt like a bunch of people in one movie trying to remake the little mermaid.  My daughters favorite princess and one of my favorite movies, just could not connect to this movie."
Eyanna,5,"Loved everything about the movie! I laughed, cried, recited words, sung the songs and danced along to the new tunes. Fantastic job!"
My R.,5,This is how you remake a movie! You leave it like the original
unknown,3,"It was half and half for me, Ariel has a great singing voice, and Eric was good, but there were some people acting that was a bit disappointing, and the new songs were okay but they just didn't fit with the vibe that the original soundtrack, and they took out the best scenes that the original animation film had which was disappointing as well. For me personally at the beginning, it was a bit boring but towards the end, it was interesting especially when Ariel finds out about Ursula."
Jameelah,5,"I loved it so much, my daughter and her best friend also enjoyed it."
Monica H,5,Loved it.  Halle Bailey was great.
Brianna,4,"Clever substitutions from my childhood version,  a must see!"
Samantha,4,"I love it. There were a couple of things I felt they could have done differently, but as a whole, I loved it."
Jessica,4,Amazing! Halle is a superstar. Flounder and Sebastian could have been done better appearance and animation wise.
Ruby,4,"Good movie. The moral of the story is, two culture can come together as one. God is the creator of all.  Love conquers everything and everyone. Prosper together and let God do the judging. Be blessed."
Christine,4,"Very well done!
Reimagined beautifully!
Wonder filled!
Not a fan Eric,s first song"
Leslie,2,"The story line was changed, the characters changed and the songs that made the movie a hit and fun to sing along with back then were also changed. And these changes were not for the better. The characters were not fun or engaging.
The acting was weak, the backgrounds and settings not attractive."
Kenya,5,Amazing remake of this classic! Halle fid amazingggg and Melissa McCarthy is also GOLD on the screen!
evangela  m,3,I enjoyed it but the acting was very blah. Only person who seemed to give it their all was Melissa McCarthy. I loved the new songs and the take on the originals.
Hope,5,My daughters and I absolutely loved the diversity throughout the movie! Hailey Bailey did an amazing job!!!!
Sharon,5,The movie was so vivid with all the colors in the ocean. Halle Bailey was a wonderful Ariel she did an awesome job.  I would give this movie 100 %
Nikki F,5,"I loved the movie! it stayed true to the original story and I liked the added character development for Eric. Halle Bailey was phenomenal, her voice is magical. Ursula's  character was well played by Melissa McCarthy and Sebastian and Scuttle were great comic reliefs. I thought there should have been some flashback scenes with Ariel and King Triton to establish  their relationship more....their chemistry was flat. Overall, it was a great live action remake!"
Brenda,5,"I loved the beautiful sea animals, colors, songs, and theme."
Kayb,5,"This was a great family movie! Brought back memories plus new ones. Tip, don't bring children under 4 years old, it's not animated so it will not keep them entertained. Crying babies and toddlers is annoying."
La Toya,5,"I love the story, action, and the graphics of the movie."
Jemond B,5,The performances of the entire cast were amazing! Obviously the songs in the Little Mermaid were Caribbean so it was great to see the representation in the movie as well
Ms Pandalove,5,It was an excellent movie!  Top notch  I would recommend all ages to see it. Perfect vocals and photography. I would see it again.
Keoni D,5,It was absolutely one of the best live action movies Disney as made to date! I cried so many happy tears and I know Ill watch again and again just like the original animated version! 10/10 its a must see! I would give it more than 5 stars if I could!
La Mar,5,"The movie was well done, fun for young children and families alike. One we'll see again."
Shari,5,"The movie was captivating with the music , songs and colorful scenery from start to finish. Halle did an excellent job as Arielle and Melissa as Ursula. The comedy was on point as Sebastian and other characters. The children and adults in our audience applauded and LOVED it!"
Jaeden,5,Halle Bailey did such an amazing job as Ariel! I dont think anyone else could have brought the character to real life the way she did. The rest of the cast also did a great job and the music was incredible!
Daniel,4,"Overall, I enjoyed the movie.  My girls have seen the original many times and also enjoyed the movie.   They didn't sing my favorite song. I'd be lying if I said I didn't laugh or have any emotional connection to parts of it.  if my girls wanted to see it again, I would go with them."
Thomas B,5,"The cast was terrific! Great live adaptation -- the ""Under the Sea"" choreography was beautiful!"
Briauna,5,I loved the movie. It was good. Has its own twist but still gave me nostalgia of the original.
Michael,5,"The movie was great. From the visuals, to the music, to the acting abilities of the whole cast. I had a smile on my face during the whole movie. I tried to look get rid of that smile on my face while watching the movie, but it was stuck there the whole time. I want to see it again 😅"
JM,5,Halle and Jonah were great. They had amazing chemistry. Sebastian and scuttle were funny. Didnt love the VFX but the movie was really cute. So many goosebumps during part of your world!!
Marie-Claire G,5,I absolutely loved every minute of it .
Nadya,5,Such a great movie!! A new take on a classic with elements of the original film sprinkled throughout.
Beatrice K.,5,The singing was great. My husband who was reluctant to got is still talking about it this morning.  Another Disney classic that I can’t wait to watch with the grandkids.
Julie,5,It was an awesome movie. Magical
Tonya,5,"It was a WONDERFUL movie. I Thoroughly enjoyed every second. The actors, theatrics, sounds, singing and animations were incredible! I strongly recommend!"
Danielle,5,Amazing !! it was done perfectly ! and the smile on every child face who sees the representation is heartwarming !
Kristi,5,The movie was awesome. The theater...not so great. You can order food from your theater seat and they'll bring it to you. Servers were bringing food to people all through the movie. It was very disruptive.
Jasmine,5,BeautifulBest Live Action by far !!!! Go watch in 3D
Mary E K,3,"The movie is over 2 hours, far too long for any smaller children to stay interested.   The original animated LIttle Mermaid was only 83 mins.   This movie had many cute scenes, but it had some scenes that smaller children would find horrifying such as the shark scene.  It just wasn't as fun as the original animated movie.   We missed seeing the scene with the chef and Sebastian, and no one can live up to the Ursula voiced by the late Pat Carroll."
Not thrilled,4,Movie was good. Well done. However the theater sold our seats not twice but three times. People found seat elsewhere but the back row all had multiple people with the same tickets. The theater owner has no idea how it happened
Alicia,4,"Despite what a lot of people said about it, I thought it was a really good movie with a great cast! The only thing I can really complain about is the Caribbean accents. I love Daveed Diggs, but the Jamaican accent just wasnt giving honestly (coming from someone who is Jamaican btw). I love the additional songs and as much as everyone else seems to hate to admit it, Lin Manuel Miranda lyrics are always baller."
Melissa,5,The movie was awesome! It's sad how even in a kids movie people really lead with their racist thoughts. Change the race of the mermaid and all is forgiven.
Marsha,4,I love the lesson to the story.
Cynthia P,5,"Loved the characters, the singing and especially Hallie Baileyportrayal of Ariel, absolutely amazing!"
Nina D,5,My Daughter loved it
Ashlyn,5,"AMAZING!! The music, visuals and acting absolutely incredible."
Tammy G,5,Excellent movie!!! One of my favorite Disney live action movies!!!!
Mikisha,5,I love the new take on this original classic. The diversity of merpeople from different seas is wonderful to see. I think I enjoy as much as my 7 year old daughter.
Sherrell,3,I liked it. It was cute. The Little Mermaid was never my favorite Disney movie but I would actually watch this again
Kurt,5,The look and feel of the movie were perfect for the type of film that it was.  Good casting.
Andrea,5,"The movie captivated my attention from start to finished! I love the storyline and all of the amazing details in the movie, too! The actors were phenomenal as well!"
Google,4,They made the right changes to the movie which made Ariel become a princess I can get behind and respect my daughter growth and development
CEmery,5,Overall great movie! Halle was amazing! Her singing and acting were on point for her first major role. Disney could have done a little better on the CGI of being underwater. And I liked one of the new songs with Scuttle and Sebastian. Go see the movie for yourself!
Uzuri H,5,They did a great job with the movie.  They honored the original while making it all their own.
Kai,4,Movie was amazing especially since we saw it in 4D. It made me feel like I was right in the movie with them. Two thumbs up
Erika,3,"This is a very well know movie my favorite Disney at that I actually waited a long time to see this come to life and wasnt to please.movie but Im going to say what I liked first Eric was given a song, Ursula was awesome. I think Melissa did her part. The little wrapping song that Scotto and Sebastian had. I like how they put the scene for the marriage at the castle instead of the boat.
Now what I didnt like I definitely didnt like her singing I didnt like the extra part of part of this world I didnt like how they made that statue king Tritons acting sucked really bad I didnt like the fact that the sisters names why would they do that I didnt like that they took out the musical in the beginning on why Ariel was missing.
I didnt mind some of the changes, but I definitely would have liked for some of the stuff to stay the same. This is a classic and I dont think that big changes for classics are good. This wasnt a whole different little mermaid movie. This was supposed to be created as a life movie for the classic cartoon movie."
Lisa,5,Loved the movie - simply beautiful!
Kris,3,No chemistry between the mermaid and the prince. Songs were just ok. Great visuals.
China H,5,The movie was literally amazing!! I am going to watch it until I get tired of it. I highly recommend!!
Ms. Angela,5,The entire movie and cast were phenomenal and I'm definitely watching it again. They did an amazing job!!! Halle Bailey was superb and the perfect actress for this role!!!!! I watched it in RPM didn't disappoint at all!
Melissa,5,Great movie my granddaughter love it. Halle Bailey was great.
Kristin,5,"The movie was beautiful! The vibrant colors, the diversity shown, the story was sweet and innocent, and the singing was awesome! My daughter loved it. We cant wait until it comes to Disney plus to watch it again."
Dawn,3,"The movie is too long, especially for the little ones. The colorful scenes were amazing. Cool special effects."
Aretha,5,We loved the movie. The songs was great. The actors awesome.
Brenda,5,Very entertaining and loved the music and scenery. Great movie for the whole family.
Cyn,4,Loved the animation. Very loud for children though.
Victoria,5,"OMG! I love! Love! LOVE this movie! Ariel is literally my favorite disney princess, and to see Halle Bailey portray her was a bonus! So beautiful! Whole cast/ movie OUTSTANDING! 1000/10 recommend!"
Suzanne F F,1,"In no way is this movie suited for little children., there was some lovely parts of the movie but the original  enchantment  of the first film  is nit there. Melissa Mccarthy is pretty fab as Ursula is fabulous ... but the movie is way long..."
ktee,2,Not sure how it got PG rating was very violent for younger kids
Tanna,5,Loved all the animations! Great 3 D movie! Lots of people of color!
Toni,5,"Acting, singing, special effects were phenomenal. The remake was inclusive of all races which depicts todays world. Halle Bailey played the perfect Aerial. Not because of her race but because her voice is amazing and she was the right PERSON for the role."
Monica,5,"Excellent, I loved it. Reminded me of my childhood, but better."
prince,5,I just loved so much …. Beautiful film thanks Disney 😍
Regina Turner,5,"The movie was awesome and Halle did such an amazing job, loved her in this movie."
Isaiahs Mimi,5,The movie was beautifully done. The 3D effects were awesome and added so much more to the movie. Halle Bailey played Ariel so gracefully and sang so beautifully in the movie. The remake couldnt have been any better. All the kids reactions in the theater proved that it was a total success. Inclusion is a beautiful and powerful thing and Im so glad to have witnessed so many children and adults alike enjoy a classic turned into a modern day classic all over again.
Vasefanua,5,Amazing movie and cast
Vita,4,Cool to see it in live action.  Good new songs.  Scuttle was the funniest. Kids will enjoy.
jasmine,5,Loved it 10/10. Will see it again while it’s still in theaters.
Monica,5,"I loved the movie, the whole cast did great"
Matthew M,3,"Unfortunately, the new songs and added story elements took away from the film. The lead actress had a beautiful singing voice, but this one didn't have the emotional impact of the original. I'm sure I'm in the minority when I say the underwater scenes were wonderfully done, but the scenes on land were laborious to sit through."
Fantasia,5,Hailey Bailey sings like a bird. This was a sweet story.. My children loved it.
Bo,5,very surprised. it was similar to the animated version but Halle really did a wonderful job. she is meant to be a princess
Liz,5,I love the storyline the ocean scenery and cast was breathtaking the music was angelic
Jasmine Manzo,4,"Beautiful film, so much nostalgia from the classic film."
Clara  R,5,I was leery of watching this version but they did a great job!
Briceson,5,A tale as old as time. I love the fact there were nods from both the cartoon Disney version and from the Hans Christian Andersen fairy tale. The original music brought me back to my childhood while the new scores kept me falling in love for more. I recommend this 12/10. I’m coming back tomorrow to see it again.
Adam,3,okay movie. they could have done better with the music and the visuals. under the sea could have been done so much better besides the music everything else was on point .
T,5,Wish flouder & sebastian wouldve been a little cuter/less real.
Google,1,so different than original. poor story telling. not a fan of new songs. overall just underwhelming while being very overwhelming
Hanna,4,My daughter loved it! 🤍
Fabiola,5,"I love the movie , such a beautiful story ."
Francis D,4,The ending was a little over the top.
Ben513,5,halle bailey as ariel is the most magical casting since judy garland as dorothy
Brown Sugar,5,Beautiful with some unique songs .
Marcella,5,We love every thing abt it. Waiting for past 2
Google,4,Loved everything about the movie
Erica,4,"Of course, nothing is perfect, but I feel like they captured the idea of the original Little Mermaid. Halle Bailey was amazing as her version of Ariel! Her voice, her portrayal of innocence. Beautiful! Overall, a film that pleased my inner child and I can’t watch it again AND share with my future children."
Google,5,It was a great remake for a real version of the little mermaid. It spoke clearly to every young little girl to not give up on hope and to encourage family and individual values can be important together versus separate.
Diana,1,It was so boring Im so disappointed
Google,5,I liked it it was like the cartoon
Roy Barron,4,"Halle Baileys voice was like a real life siren incantation, absolutely amazing!"
Vic Bee,5,"Great movie, great cast, great visuals, just an all-around great movie. My daughter can't wait to watch it again!"
Paola,5,I loved it Halle Bailey was such an amazing Ariel and the whole cast was amazing Melissa as Ursula was also amazing and Jonah as prince Eric I cant say a bad word about it absolutely brilliant
Joan M,5,"Little Mermaid was a visual treat, lovely songs written by Manuel Lynn Miranda,always active, emotional, and filled with interesting  inclusiveness.   Color or ethnic background of the characters was irrelevant to the storyline and plot which was refreshing to see..   We  saw it in I max.  It mus be pretty in 3D also."
Adrienne,5,"Followed the story line. Halles voice is incredible. Featured a cameo of the OG little mermaid, Jodi Benson"
Tiffany,5,"Halle Bailey was amazing! The graphics, the singing, everything was so good!"
G,2,Movie is not original
Abraham,3,The cast was good and the musical scenes were great but does not compare to the original (obviously). Would recommend!
Arnesha,5,Amazing! New added songs but it was so true to the original! I plan to go see it again!
lupita,5,I honestly loved it 💜
Andre C,5,I enjoyed the special effects and the story. Disney Disney. Did a great job keeping up with the original cartoon storyline in this movie.Great job with the song choices and the cast.
ladydoddington,5,"I absolutely loved it! The best live action retelling Disney has made to date! The original was my favorite movie growing up and I was so nervous to see this new one because of the let downs the live action remakes have been. Well I am happy to say that I was very pleasantly surprised and impressed! If you’re on the fence, don’t be, go and see it!"
Bre C,5,"Magical. Took me back to childhood, It was great."
Liz,4,"Ursula stole the show! Melissa Mcarthy was hands down the best choice IMO. Did I miss a few scenes from the original little mermaid. Of course! Would chef and Sebastians scene added to the film? probably yes! It would have made a fun silly scene. Overall enjoyed the live action LM. Prince Eriks solo was a bit cringy as my son put it. Could have done without but he was a great Prince. The wedding was very anticlimactic, it started and ended so quickly. All in all must watch. Chloe was a great fit and incredibly talented. Her voice was especially touching."
angela smith,5,The Little Mermaid was beautiful - I loved it all over again!
Madison,5,The movie was amazing! Halle made a great debut as the Little Mermaid.

Jasmine,5,The entire production was magic! Everything came to life so well to depict such a beautiful story. Truly an experience!
Joseph,5,"This was beautifully done, by far one of the best live action Disney retelling ever done. Changes made were necessary, and the acting was outstanding. 3D was not used to distract from the story, it really enhanced it. It was funny, emotional, and campy. The visuals were stunning the music was PHENOMENAL, and the story was fully fleshed out. Will be definitely seeing this again."
Guest,5,"Despite that we have an image of what Ariel looks like the movie brought everything out to the best in my opinion, and in 3D even better. Loved it!  It was an amazing Under The Sea lol!"
Sandra,5,"Loved the special effects, loved the costumes of the characters, but I feel like the directors could have had a better ending showing prince Eric and Princess Ariel getting married."
Bizmarkee,2,Was pretty coo. Love me some fins.
Ariana,5,"I read All the complaints about this movie before going so i can see what people were talking about.. yall if anyone says they hate this movie, theyre either lying or havent seen it. So many surprises, laughs and cries the movie has given me.. well done!

kir,5,Exceeded my expectations. Might have to go back and watch again!
Stephanie  C,2,"So much of the Essence of the real Little Mermaid was lost. Im disappointed. The movie could have been better and had the potential to wow but it didn’t. However, Melissa did a great job with Ursula. My 8 year old got bored and my husband fell asleep."
Eden,5,amazing movie it's the best live action Disney movie to date Halle Bailey cooked!!
Ivonne,4,"I like the idea that the little mermaid is black and I also like the cinematography picture and vibrant colors of the scenes. 

I didnt like how the mother of the prince is close minded as far as the prince liking a girl like Ariel as well as the fact that The princes mom doesnt seem like his mom because it takes away from reality but everything else was great."
Dayanys,5,"la mejor película que eh visto. la Amé, me recordó mi niñez. Los actores estuvieron fantasticos. Que puedo decir, lo mejor. llore desde principio a fin. Para esta película le doy no 5 sino 100000000000000000 🌟 estrellas
the best movie i've ever seen.  I loved it, it reminded me of my childhood.  The actors were fantastic.  What can I say, the best.  I cried from start to finish.  For this movie I give not 5 but 100000000000000000 🌟 stars"
Thoroughly satisfied GenX,5,"It takes skill to go from animation to live action. it takes the great abiility of the writers to take a film created in another decade snd make it up to date and culturally appropriate with our society now. And it takes artistic creativity to bring to life characters that that we fell in love with from years past. I think the animators, the writers, the actors, and the musicians dis an amazing job!! How to do make mermaids real? I'd say given all the knowledge, skills, and abilities we possess now, Disney did an absolutely wonderful job with how they portrayed Ariel and Eric and Ursala, and all the characters that gave their all for this film. If you don't like the story, or the graphics, or the casting, do it yourself 😊"
Hayleigh Henderson,5,The graphics and Halle’s singing were truly breathtaking! Very humorous as well. I loved it.
Cortney  W,5,Such a wonderful movie! I’m so happy for Halle Bailey. Follow me on twitter I have art for you! @cfellathegreat
Jasmine,5,Everything was amazing!!!
April,5,"I've been waiting for this for so long. The Little Mermaid was the first movie I remember seeing in the theater as a child, so this was so special to me! Halle was phenomenal, Awkwafina as Scuttle was an excellent choice. Lin-Manuel Miranda's new songs fit right in with the rest of the originals. And Melissa's Ursula.... I have no words to describe how completely perfect she was for this part. 

As a lifelong Little Mermaid fan, I absolutely love this movie. Anyone upset about it is just trying to start unnecessary drama. 

I also loved the Jodi cameo. 🤌🏻"
Roy,5,I loved Halle and the way she portrayed this roll!
theelifeofkc,5,100/10 highly recommended 🥳
Chris2146,5,"It was brought to life in a new exiting way. This is one of my new favorite movies from Disney. I love the fact that Disney at times goes against what ""some people might not like"". We are all different, and it should celebrated, Disney definitely got this right. I will likely see this movie again and buy it too when available. Both of my kids LOVED IT TOO."
MonaMala,5,Halle was absolutely beautiful! I wanted to was hear her sing whenever she wasn't. I watched the new Little Mermaid in 3D and was so glad I did. Extremely well done visuals.
Adrian,3,I will give it a 8/10 pretty good
Miah,4,They didn’t put the chef scene so 4 stars.
Alexis,5,"An absolute delight of a live action! Halle shines in her role as Ariel, as do the rest of the cast. It was vibrant, fun, and heartwarming. Disney’s best live action thus far."
Ana J,5,"Loved the music, the characters, and the underwater scenes."
Julian,5,This movie was absolutely everything. Iconic. And I was tearing up. 10/10
Benta L,5,I loved Halle Bailey’s voice!  It is so incredible!
Souls Mom,5,Loved the representation and the swag
Ray M,4,"I loved it from beginning to end. A reminder of what Disney movies should be like, true fairytales, far off lands, beautiful songs. Every member was perfectly cast. Adds just enough to the original to make it it’s own. Truly can’t find much wrong with it."
Nekia,5,Love everything about it!!!
Patty,4,The run time was too long for little children

Pato P,3,Graphics were a disappointment. But very true to the classical storyline.
kevin,4,If you have young daughters or nieces this is a great film to take them to go see. Fun time for the kids!

Trisha I,5,Halle Bailey did an excellent job as Ariel both in her acting and singing.  I love the new music arrangements and liberties taken. I love the new cultural experience I had with this movie. My only negative remark would be that I felt like Disney missed something in the ending.

Brittney Jones,5,Literally so beautiful and nostalgic!! 5/5! Well done!!
PEGGY S,5,"I really liked the movie, better than the animated ones. For me best Little Mermaid movie. As for the theater it would be nice if parents repected other individuals when they take their children to the movies (don't let them run loose and monitor their talking) it was bothersome. If parents aren't taking charge then the theater should do something about it."
Deega,0,I had to weave and didnt get a refund
Emily,5,Loved every minute! So did my daughters!
Tiffany  j,5,I loved everything about this movie. The fact that it was all races and ethnicities was amazing

Haille Bailey gave a heartfelt performance as Ariel. I loved Aquafina as Scuttle was one of my favorites in this.Nothing negative to say. My first time to but tickets in advance. Easy once I got the app to work."

Anquanette Jackson,5,"Love that it was a live movie, and it had its own twist to it."

Elaina,4,This movie was wonderful. It shows how a parent love is so strong that we know deep down we have to let go and allow them to live their own lives.
Javi,5,even better than i thought!!
Micah Z.,5,"Disney did it once again. I believe this is the best live action adaptation they’ve had in quite a long time. The movie definitely lived up to the hype prior to its release. Halle portrayed Ariel perfectly, she was made for that role and rightfully deserved it. I was pleasantly surprised by Ursula and Prince Eric, they did a wonderful job as well. Please take your families to see this and ignore the noise from all of the ignorant critics who downplayed the movie from the beginning."

Tameshia,5,Loved every second the graphics were so beautiful!!!
Jaimi,5,I laughed and oddly almost cried.. it was beautiful...
Carlos Carballo,1,"Terrible!!! I left early I believe it was at the part where they began “Kiss the Girl”. No more live action movies of Disney animated classics, Disney! Please! This movie was such torture. I wasn’t mad that I spent money to leave early I was at a point where I would pay additional money to leave early."
Michele,5,Haley Bailey was superb in this Disney.  I love that she was allowed to use her natural hair and not a wig to transform her to look like the animated character

The chemistry between Jonah and Halle brought me to tears. The movie is so colorful, so magical, and definitely a must-see. I felt like I was in the ocean too!

Google,5,Loved every bit of it. Finally a little black girl get a chance to shine
Ashley H,5,"It was absolutely fantastic! The original Little Mermaid came out when I was 7 years old and it was a fantastic film back then. I was not certain that they could do this remake to be good or better than the original and it absolutely was. The imagery they through in here with so many different cultures and nationalities couldn't have told a better message of ""love is love"". My 13 year old and 10 year old loved it - and it was even better that we saw it 4D in the theatre with the moving seats."
AL,3,"liked the cast, but didn't like the CGI very fake."
Henry C,5,Great movie. The added elements have more depth to characters and the entire cast was great. A movie you will be happy watching and smiling throughout the entire film.

TAKIMA,5,It followed the cartoon very close but it was very good.
Yvette,5,"The movie stayed true to the classic while adding new elements that only enhanced the story we know and love. Halle was PHENOMENAL. The animation was great. If you love the original, youll absolutely love this!"
Michelle,5,Amazing!! Everything was phenomenal!!
Matthew,4,"The movie was great! Stuck to the original story, while also making it its own. Made a background story for Eric, which was awesome. The only reason that it wasn’t a 5 star is because the underwater CGI on the mermaids looked weird. Made Ariel look off as she was swimming, but once she was out of the water she was beautiful! Would definitely watch again!"
Julian H,5,"I absolutely love the movie and the ending it was amazing the music and rapping was excellent love the characters and creativity, The crab and the pelican is funny!"

Samiyyah K,4,I really liked it! it's one of the better live action remake. I wanted more Ursula but that's what I say about the animated one.

Corey,4,Good music and cast.
Ashley,4,"My niece was amazed and she’s tough to please, still talking about it😊"
Spencer W.,4,"The music, vocal work of Halle Bailey and additional story behind Prince Eric made me enjoy this movie in a way I did not care for as much as the original. It wasn’t perfect, but it worked great in the ways that mattered."
storm_trauma,5,"Excellent movie, very well done. Maybe a little long for younger kids."
TYENNA  N,5,I love it everything was great about the movie
Ivory,5,Sooo beautiful! I LOVE the new touches to the movie. Second time going to see it and it was just as beautiful as the first time! I may go again !

Luis,5,Great movie! Watch it!!
Andrew H,4,It was a fun movie. I liked how they explained certain things to make the live action version flow. Great cinematography.
Michael C,5,Great update of a childhood classic
Dixie,5,The Perfect choice for Ariel definitely want to have this movie in my collection
Vincent,5,"Incredible cast! Halle Bailey is a Superstar.. I feel this is the only Disney live action movie where the additions to the story actually work to better and enhance the film. The chemistry between Ariel and Eric is magical. Just sit back and enjoy the ride, you’ll have a good time"
Lakesha,5,Great story line!! I
Raelynn,5,"Beautifully made, it had all of the elements that I love from the original and more!"
Katherine,4,"Some of the acting could have been better, but with that being said it was enjoyable. Very nostalgic knowing that I was 5 yrs old when the original came out, and now I’m here with my kids. I think Halle did great with the singing!"
Lakiesha Underdue,4,It was great but it would be better if when the rain or the storm come in you can throw a little water and that was a dumb way to tell him her name but ok it WAS STILL A GREAT MOVIE
michael g,4,it is 90% the same story which is fine I think they could have done a bit better but I enjoyed it
Ebone,5,I love love loved every single moment! I laughed I cried. Bravo Disney! To the haters: keep that negative BS to yourself!!!
Courtney B,4,Omggg the acting and singing was amazing
Cassandra C,5,"INCREDIBLE movie!! Halle was PERFECT as Ariel. She was literally made for The Little Mermaid. The whole thing was so visually appealing, music was amazing, Lin-Manuel Miranda always does a superb job with the music/scripting.. The storyline didn’t stray at all from the original. I cried 3 times. Such a full circle moment for me, as The Little Mermaid was the first movie I ever saw as a child when it first came out in the 80s. As a Blk woman at 38, seeing a Blk Ariel— especially one who delivers made me emotional. Run to go see this! You won’t regret it! Exceptional work by Disney."
Crystal,5,I really liked my experience with my husband it was my birthday and yall are where I decided to spend part of it.
Donna,4,I love the fact that this movie was so real. I love the fact that this movie was so real. I love the fact that Melissa McCarthy played a bad character. I love that it was so many different races for so many different characters.. I love that it was so many different races for so many different characters.
Andrea W,4,"This was a really great rendition! I wish that my daughter would have had access to this type of representation as a child, but I was super happy to see it with her now as an adult"
Kai,5,"Although they changed some things about it, overall it didnt worsen the story at all. The songs were amazing! I loved it! I hope they make another one! Please go see it!"
Arynn,5,I loved it so much they killed it
Michelle,5,Beautiful presentation! On point with the animated version with a little well done extras.
Angela M,5,Love the representation!!!! Needed so much in society!
Eboni-Jordan,5,AMAZING!!! 3D really brought it to life for me!
Vivian F,5,It was a beautifully told story and the visuals were awesome!
Sydney,4,"Not afraid to lean on the original, but has very fresh and clearer takes on the motives of the characters. Visual effects are STUNNING and most of the actors/voice work is spot on! Halle is BRILLIANT as Ariel."
Jackie,5,Loved it!! Id say the only negative for me was Erics song. Snooze fest. But the rest of the movie was great and everything was so colorful and beautiful
Angelina,5,"There was literally only one small thing I didnt like. And that was after Ariel saved him from dying, he sang a song. They couldve left that part out. Other than that, I absolutely loved it."
sar,5,"beautiful, love the concept"
Slim Jim,5,"Stayed true to the original. Brought my 5 year old daughter, she liked it. A+"

Son of Ursula,5,"The movie was phenomenal! The direction of the film was beautiful, and the slightly updated musical arrangements were nostalgic as well as modern. Amazing film! Melissa McCarthy is a star. Pity to the poor unfortunate soul who misses this in theatres!"
Jeffrey J,5,I love the movie because its interracial its about time Disney got it right and all the music was perfect time for unity and peace

Caitlin,5,Gorgeous cinematography.  Fabulous acting.  Beautiful story from start to finish!!
Adam W,5,"Wonderful movie!  Halle Bailey was terrific as Ariel.
A must see!"
Gricelda J,3,"I thought it was ok. I was hoping my 5 yr old would enjoy it, but unfortunately she did not. She wanted to go home in the middle of it. We both agreed that it started out very slow, then got more interesting more towards the end of the movie."
Karla,5,"Loved this movie! Stayed true to the animated story overall. The music was great, new songs were great, costumes were wonderful and actresses and actors did a great job!"
LHC,5,music was amazing! #SCUTTLEBUTT
Curtiss,4,"It was incredibly faithful to the Disney classic. The CG effects were a bit iffy in places. Of the new songs, I liked 2 out of 3. There were some tweaks to song lyrics that I heard about and didn't notice. Changes made to the characters were appreciated. The run-time made sense, in theory, but it for sure ran long. It's not replacing the original animated feature, but as far as the live-action adaptations go, it's one of the better ones as of late."
mistiweathers U,5,The singing was cute!
Richard,4,Great retelling of a well known story the only negative for me was some o f the singing was not the best. Actor and singers are not always interchangeable.
Darcey,5,Most of the original parts were in it plus additional songs!
Adina,4,Different races than  the original made it seem less authentic but it was an AMAZING movie . Gave me chills and reminded me of my childhood. The humor was great .

Megan Mermaid,5,Omg  great movie love it.
Cristi,5,Great music! Loved the new scenes!
Paris,4,"The Little Mermaid was very good. I liked the whole movie, even the new songs were good!"
Tabatha,4,The first movie my parents took me to as a kid was the original. Now its not the first Ive taken my kid to but I did take her and I absolutely loved it! Brought back my childhood and the love of family is so important.
T Love,5,I love the animation and the acting the most. You can tell a lot of work went into making this movie. My kids and I loved it!
Anonymous,5,Absolutely amazing!! Halle Bailey is the next generational talent the world needed.. It sucks many audiences won’t give this a chance because they won’t be able to get past her skin color—their lost. This movie is an instant classic!
Sarah F,5,"Beautiful voice, lovely scenes and loved the modernization of Ariel and the story."

Aisha H,4,It was a refreshing take on a Disney classic. Very nice to see the film industry pushing towards more diversity and this movie was obviously sending a clear message of people coming together for a more inclusive world.
Sonja H,5,Absolutely Great movie
Nicole,4,"In order to enjoy this movie, you have to remove the cartoon out your head. That movie was made in 1989. It is 2023. 

Allow what the creators did to captivate you instead of doing a side by side comparison of every detail. This movie was great. I will be seeing it again."
Kym,5,10/10 definitely would recommend!!
Dani P,4,It’s magical yet a little long. Halle is a superstar
Rosie C,5,"Im usually terrified of live action renditions of classic 
animated movies. But I absolutely loved this one!"

elaine,5,Greatest movie ever it was my first experience with 3-D and I absolutely loved it
Kimberly,5,Hailey did an Awesome performance!! This role was written just for her and she deserves every accolade!!
Nikki,5,I loved it and all the diversity!!!
Amy S,4,"The movie was great from what I could hear if it. If it wasn’t for the rude, inconsiderate family sitting behind us talking and cursing the whole time it would have been a great experience."
WAI Y,3,It was a little too long IMO.  There could have been at least 15-20 minutes shaved off.  Melissa McCarthy is fantastic as Ursula as she took the role and ran with it.  Hallie Bailey is a star and she shines brightly.  Akwafina is good in small doses but way too much here and please no more singing from her.    Bring your kids and have a good time.
maritza,5,We love every moment of the movie!
Deneen O,5,Very well done!!! Highly recommend!
M. Rae,5,"I love the new live of the Little Mermaid. it's so much compared to the original animated movie, but different and new. the cast who played the characters, they're fantastic. Absolutely fantastic compared to the live Beauty and the Beast."

Steff,5,Halle Bailey was amazing as Ariel! The movie was the best live action by far.
Ari,5,Loved it! Every actor knocked it out of the park!! Will see it again soon!
Manuel Arzola,5,Good live rendition (always a fan of the mermaid)
Sue,4,"Yes, cgi and lighting were tough in some spots and especially in the last act but the efforts were there. Halle Bailey is a delight whether you agree with her physical attributes or not. She embodies Ariel’s spirit and her voice is gorgeous. Not to mention best mermaid tail and movement in any show or movie. Film is not perfect, few characters are one dimensional and contributed very little but it’s not as disastrous as some people hoped it would be. Go in with an open mind and heart, it’s a fun homage to the animated version."
CAROL L,5,"This is a fantastic movie to watch. The singing was marvelous, and each character was great.  It displayed action, sadness, and happiness. You may tear up a time or two, but you can breathe a sigh of relief in the end."
Teciya,5,"Bes
t movie everyone yeah quality was on point"
Susan,5,I liked everything about this movie. I recommend seeing it in digital 3D.

Justin,5,"I understand that reboots of these films usually arent the greatest, but this absolutely exceeded my expectations in every way. The added material was a nice touch of depth to the story and Halle embodies Ariel so beautifully. Disney has gotten this one right (finally)! Bravo!"
Jeffrey,5,The movie was really great
Arielle,5,Amazing from beginning to end
Vicki  J,5,"The graphics were beautiful, music awesome, and the diversity was spectacular. Sea witch could be a little scary for younger ones. I saw a few dads put little girls in their lap during several scenes."
Marc,4,Disney did an amazing job!  Must see
Adelina,5,I absolutely loved this movie. It was such a beautiful thing to be able to see this with my daughters. Had my attention from beginning to end and will most likely see it again!
Shawna,5,I loved the movie. It was a wonderful remake. Hailee and the rest of the actors did a great job. Lil Mermaid is my all time favorite Disney Princess!
Wayne M,4,"Easily one of the Best Disney Live action remakes. Casting was great, music was awesome, story was well done.   My only critique is that the visuals underwater were a little off somehow. If you are going to bring sea creatures to life, go the little extra."
Kawanda,5,Very good movie kid friendly
Alton G,4,GREAT feel of nostalgia for sure. Halle Bailey really shines in this movie!
Ruqayyah,4,"I really enjoyed it! I just missed the one song/ scene that was omitted. But other than that, it was done really well and I'm so glad I went to see it!"

Giselle,5,"Halle is the PERFECT Ariel, every time she said I started tearing up. She has a beautiful voice. Her acting is great, she really brought Ariel’s character to life. Jonah was also an amazing Prince Eric, their chemistry was great! Overall, the movie was very good and cute. I want to go watch it again!"

Lori S,5,"Excellent movie, loved it"
E S,5,"Went with an open mind, not assuming that it will be scene to scene like the animated film. It was comedic, moving and whimsical. Definitely going to watch again. The music is great. It is a very good film on its own without comparing it to the classic. Separate entities."
Rhia N,5,A must see! Had me in tears.. it’s everything we need to experience
Julie,5,I loved that the original songs were sung along with plot. I also really loved the additional parts that added to the story. I really amazingly well done movie that highly respected the animation.
Kathy S,5,"The special effects were beyond amazing the story was very similar to the original but toward the end this new one brought me to tearsone scene showed that no matter how different we look from each other, love and mutual respect joins us all together. This movie gives us hope that we can overcome any obstacle together. Sometimes fantasy can indeed reflect reality. Bravo, Disney!"
LadyWarlx,4,"My family went to see the little mermaid today with Halle Bailey. My daughter really enjoyed the movie. She has only seen the cartoon version that was previous released. It was nice to see a realistic movie with such diversity.

Personally, the only thing I did not like in the movie was flounder, wasnt really not yellow."
Cassandra,5,beautiful movie for all ages.
Maja,5,Super cute interpretation of a fairy tale. The actors were perfect for the roles they played. I really enjoyed it.

From the visuals to the acting to the vocals in the songs, I will definitely being seeing it about 2 more times. Halle KILLED it as Ariel and I will not stop singing part of your world.

Hakari,5,It was amazing from the graphics down to the vocals they did they Thang.
Ross V,2,"It was fine. Totally competent film making. But ultimately pointless and, worse than that, significantly inferior to the original animated film. Its fascinating to me that Disney, arguably the greatest animation house in history, keeps making these live action remakes which remove all of the magic/ fun/ comedy of the original — as if Disney somehow doesnt understand the power of animation. For example, Under The Sea — animated, its fun and funny and delightful, all the other underwater creatures swimming around and playing instruments live action — its a stage wait, totally boring, who cares?

Also, why change the story? The additional songs and beats just made it longer. Thats it. No depth was added. 

And if you are going to write new songs, why Lin Manuel? Love him or hate him, his songs ALWAYS sound the same, and they NEVER sound like The Little Mermaid. The new scuttle song felt flown in from another movie. 

Melissa McCarthy is a fantastic and hilarious actress, but unfortunately in this movie she was directed to act like a New Yorker stereotype staple-gunned to a squid. 

Javier Bardem was fine, though strangely reserved. 

I liked Sebastian. He somehow still worked even in live action. But it was definitely weird that there was some unspoken rule that Sebastian, Flounder and Scuttle could all speak, but no other animals could. 

I missed the songs they took out. The Daughters of Triton and Les Poissons. Especially bc the replacements were Ill-fitting snooze fests. 

The addition of the Eric was adopted backstory added nothing. Feels like a screenwriter trying to justify his role after being hired to write a beloved movie that already exists. (Speaking of which, it took them a long time to finally give credit to the original writer-directors in the end credits.)

The original animated Little Mermaid is a truly great film with a fantastic and efficient script. Ultimately, deciding  to improve upon it without the benefit of being animated itself proved to be a bad idea. 

Having said all of that, my 12 year old daughter loved it. My 18 year old and 21 year old daughters did not. But Ill let them write their own reviews, should they want to."
T,0,Bad acting. Bad singing. Just bad.
Jamila,5,Halle Bailey embodied Ariel from scene one! I loved this film!
Chrissy,4,They cut the crab in the kitchen scene with the chef .. that would have been funny ..
Adriana,4,Loved how it stayed true to the original

Facebook U,5,Perfect movie!! Absolutely BEAUTIFUL!!
Shannon,5,"it was really really good. 
the only thing I wasn't crazy about was the beginning of the movie in 3d was extremely blury
 
it did change though throughout"
Regenia K,5,Loved the 3D choice. Movie was very entertaining
Fuzzy's Mom,5,It was as good and action packed as any Marvel movie.  I couldn't leave my seat and cried at the end.  Very powerful messages and strong acting by all.   Perfectly casted.

Grace,5,Blown away. Best live action Disney movie ever!
Will,5,Amazing singer and beautiful artist. Well-made cgi in my opinion. Great plot. Forgot about some of the songs from the original Disney animation and was pleasantly reminded. They really brought it to life. I cried when she wanted to be part of that world on the rock with the water splashing. Great moment in the movie and will recommend it to anyone who isn’t afraid to express their emotions. Great acting and great music all around. I honestly don’t know why I didn’t give it a full 5 stars. Maybe because it still wasn’t better than a couple movies I’ve seen in the past year. I’ve seen a ton.
Mark,4,an amazing movie felt a little long but it was still amazing but the problem was the theater itself was super hot but that's not on the movie
Nancy,5,"Loved the singing, cinematography was amazing, loved  everything!!!"
Dan,5,The Little Mermaid is everything we wanted! Our family had a blast and look forward to many watches in the future.
Ruth A,5,The Little Mermaid was simply breathtaking. The visuals were phenomenal and Halle Bailey's voice is quite literally ethereal. The main characters had such an incredible chemistry and they did an overall incredible job bringing this beautiful story to life. I love all of the changes/additions that they added into this live action version of The Little Mermaid. See it in Imax for an even more incredible experience!!
Tyler M,5,"Movie was brilliant. Halle Berry was excellent as Ariel. I'm not going to lie, she deserves to have credit. Black folks deserve to have more major roles"
Kim R,5,Loved Halle and Jonah.  Perfect chemistry!!
Kevin,5,I loved it all. All the actors are phenomenal. The graphics are great. Halle Bailey is a great Ariel.
Marcelle,5,"The storyline was good, and Melissa McCarthys interpretation of the character of Ursula was amazing! My kids loved every second and we might go back!"
Aleta,5,Superduper movie I really enjoyed my granddaughter and I
Janet,3,Movie ok but too long. Also half hour of advertising is to long for a little kids movie as they cant sit that long.
Lee Anne,5,Great!  Great animation mixed with live action!
Abena S,4,It was such a gorgeous film! So much fun and Halle is absolutely perfect as Ariel. Melissa McCarthy is also phenomenal as Ursula. Eric’s song was decent but could’ve gone without it. Enjoyed it overall and highly recommend!
branden,4,Probably the best live adaptation from Disney yet! The whole cast was phenomenal but Halle was the stand out. I’ve never heard her sing before but wow that girl can sing. Melissa was great as Ursula as well. It’s not a perfect movie with only small little nitpicks but overall a must watch
Klon,5,Much better than expected. Good blend of familiar and new! First class!
Shawn M,4,"I wasn't expecting much, hadn't heard great things, but only went because Ariel was my daughter's favorite when she was young and she just finished high school yesterday and this is how she wanted to celebrate with her dad. I really really loved this, though. Bardem and McCarthy helped it have some real heft. The look and feel was beautiful. I think I liked it more than the original animated movie and more than other Disney live-action remakes. See it on its own merits"
Martin,5,"Everything was perfect, I loved the whole movie"
Diane,5,I liked how it closely followed the animated version.  Loved the actors/characters.
Lance  A,0,"The acting was awful! Its unfortunate because this was one of my favorite Disney movies. Horrible graphics depicting water scenes, songs were nowhere near heartfelt or emotional by any means. Poorly done."
Sebastian,4,Good retelling. Would have liked to see a few more changes and the new songs were a little weak in my opinion. But string film!
Google,5,story line stayed the same the movie was good definitely would say it's a must see.
STEPHANIE  D,5,Breath taking and great acting by all! It swept you in until the end!
Michael B,3,"Doesn’t too the original, but one of the better Disney live action remakes.    Halle Bailey and Melissa McCarthy really shine in their roles."
Jorge L,5,Amazing movie! must see in theater. the reprises alone are worth the price of the ticket!
Ann S,3,Too much singing. But I enjoyed the movie.
Lacresha,4,Great movie! Little to long
dka1176,5,Go see it and form your own opinion. I loved it!
Robert,5,"WHAT A MOVIE!!!!! Its pure Disney Magic! Halle was the absolute standout of the whole film, but you have to give Melissas performance of Ursula a round of applause. This was my second viewing, and I cant wait to go back again! Part of your world (all three parts) had me in tears."
D,5,First Disney remake I’ve loved!!!! Scuttlebutt song was soooo cute
Jaleka,5,I loved it. It didn't tell it quite like the original but I love the new spin.

Ruth,5,lived the new songs and the imagery! so much to look at 💕
Derek,4,"Visually stunning, music was originally put together and good. My daughter doesn't like the original but really enjoyed this one."
Lynne,5,It was amazing! Will definitely see it again and tell everyone to go experience it as well!
Amanda,5,"I absolutely loved it. It was everything I wanted it to be after being a little mermaid fanatic my whole life. 
King tritons outfit!!!! Scuttle was so good! Halle was amazing x a million. Missed the les poisons and the purple dress at the end because thats an iconic moment for me her walking out of the sea. but I was amazed by everything and dont forget Ursula so good so so good! Cant wait to see it again!!!"
Danielle,5,My loved the singing and acting!
Crystal,4,I enjoyed the little mermaid. I like that they stayed to the original script of the movie and they had a great diverse bunch of characters. I hated the family sitting in front of me with the kids that kept the lights on the entire time. It took away from the movie they were a distraction.
TB,5,We loved it. It was magical!!!!
Facebook U,5,Amazing reenactment of the original film. All actors and actresses did an AMAZING job! Bravo!
ANM,4,"loved it. perfect in every way, just a little long for my 3.5 year old. She loved all the music and the action."
Fallon B,4,Loved it. So fun. Hailey’s voice was beautiful and her interpretation of Ariel was perfect. Loved Melissa McCarthy’s Ursella
PB,4,Ursula is definitely the star of the show!!!
Paulette,5,Took my 5 year old granddaughter snd we both loved it!
Braxton,5,Gorgeous movie absolutely amazing. Halle Bailey delivers a fantastic performance as Ariel and Melissa McCarthy was a perfect choice for Ursula.
Shannon,5,Great movie!!! We loved it.
Tierra H,5,"Loved it, so nostalgic. Halle as Ariel is splendid and Melissa totally embodies Ursula. Love the diversity of the cast, the updates story line and new songs by LMM will see avian"
Analiese,5,Love this movie! Ariel is my favorite princess since I was little and I was scared they would change too much but jt was really good! All the changes tied into together perfectly! So good!
Lawrence B,4,A great visual spectacle with wonderful performances. Just a tad long.
Maria Gary,4,"The music, colors, and the crab was hilarious"
Jennifer,5,It was soooooooo goood!!!
Monique P,5,"This movie was fantastic. I was worried about the CGI based on some reviews but Disney did a great job (we all know this is fiction so the CGI comments are silly). The lead actress was adorable and all the actors were fun, including Ursula. It really pulled at the heart strings in the end. Go see it!"
Dun Kno,5,Great movie although nuff singing
Adrian Todd,5,"Amazingly beautiful with an awesome cast! The visuals are breathtaking, and the music/vocals are 5 stellar stars 🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟!!!"
Crystal,5,Great movie! I would watch it again.
Tigerfish,2,Drags in parts and dialogue is cringe-worthy
Delores,4,It captured everything like the animated version. Ursala was wicked as ever lol.
jlu,4,"A wondrous delight. Halle is perfection & the sequences of “Part of Your World” & “Kiss the Girl” are, too. Halle & Jonah ooze chemistry. Melissa appropriately hams it up."
Alejandro L,3,"Perfection is detailed always with Disney! Magical as expected. We’ll cast and visually stunning film. My only. Note.. is the music  seemed bless potent in feeling it. But overall , a must see .."
Lisa,5,Visually stunning with minor added explanatory story/character changes that work only to enhance this movie. I love this retelling! The cast diversity is definitely an enhancement!
Dayna L,4,"Casting was perfect for this live action The Little Mermaid. Halle Bailey did a great job as Ariel, reminding us she is after all a teenager with dreams of her own. Couldn't get a better Ursula than Melissa McCarthy! Potentially frightening scenes for very young children with Ursula and her skull treasures, electric eel friends and anger scenes at the end. Prince Eric a young man who any girl would want seems a bit old for Ariel, his added song was ok, great voice. Multi cultural, multi nationality cast. The colors under the sea beyond real."
Terri,4,"The movie was great. My granddaughters loved it. They loved ursela, Ariel and scuttle so much!!"
Jason David Maddox,5,Fantastic! A wonderful treat for the whole family.
Andrea,5,"Love love loved the movie!! I didn't like the moving seats, water sprays and air bursts as much as my 9 year old but we haven't been to this theater in many years. You get extras with a 3D movie now I suppose. Overall the movie was absolutely amazing. And we both cried."
Sarah L,5,The beautiful woman who played Ariel - did so perfectly I cant imagine a better person! Absolute magical watching in the theatre. They made sure to add in all the beautiful most iconic parts of the original and nailed it!!! Exceeded my expectations for the movie!
Marc,5,"Five star not because of the visuals or the vfx, but for the cast, and truly this movie is the definition of camp lolololollllll"
Den,2,"It was basically a musical, but i shouldve expected that when I saw it was produced by Lin Manuel Miranda. There wasnt much dialogue between the characters and in almost every scene they were singing, even the prince. Which is weird because he doesnt sing in the animated version. Most scenes were changed or completely left out, especially the ending. The setting of the movie looked like it was on a Caribbean island. In the end they made it seem like their marriage was going to be the change of the future. When there was actual dialogue between the characters it was enjoyable. Halle sang beautifully but they made her drag out every syllable while she was singing which was kinda annoying. But the cast did a great job acting :)"
Zayne,0,Terrible. Poorly casted. Felt like a bad tribute to the original.
Kirk,5,"The Little Mermaid (2023) is a magical, breathtakingly, gorgeous ride of a summer blockbuster. This faithful reimagining of the original story and 1989 classic boasts a powerhouse performance from Halle Bailey who's stands toe to toe with Jodi Benson's iconic version of the little mermaid. Melissa McCarthy is deliciously evil as the Sea Witch Ursula, with Jonah Hauer-King and Javier Bardem giving some of their best work as Prince Eric and King Triton respectively. Not to mention the ecstatic vocal talents of Daveed Diggs as Sebastian, Awkafina as Scuttle, and Jacob Tremblay as Flounder. Director Rob Marshall along with Screenwriter David Magee has crafted a little mermaid that honors and respects the original film, but breathes a new life and energy into this version of the classic story. Go out and see it on the biggest screen possible. Disney's The Little Mermaid is sure to be another gem from that will be beloved for years."
Alexander M,5,The most beautiful live action movie ever
Natalie,5,What a beautiful story and the actors were fantastic! I’m going to see it again
Shannon P,1,The only good thing in this movie was Melissa McCarthy.
Tiffani,5,Love it. Beautiful movie.
Bird,5,I loved the black princess 👑
Patricia W,5,Halle Bailey was the perfect Ariel— sweet and charming with a voice to die for. Loved the new songs. This felt like a richer experience than the original which I also love. Went into this expecting to not like it and was surprisingly blown away.
Tia lampman,5,It was very good I would see it again
genesis,5,absolutely loved this movie and so did my daughter. Halle did amazing!!!!
Raven,5,Just how I remembered it
Zane K,5,Spectacular. The whole audience applauded after her song. She was amazing.
Gene Jenkins,5,"Can't say enough about how much I liked and was surprised about this movie! There's been so much hype over races and woke issues with Disney lately that I honestly prepared myself for the worst. Yes, multiple races are represented however they blend into the story and don't even get near to being over the top on any level! Each actor plays their part well and remains true to the storyline. Woke-ism aside the movie is a spectacular trip into the world of both Hans Christian Andersen and also draws from Disney's former Little Mermaid movie in many ways. The photography is stunning and the quality is exactly what an audience would come to expect from a Disney production. The only warning I would suggest is that there are some pretty scary scenes surrounding the wonderful Ursula character done to perfection by Melissa McCarthy that the little ones might become frightened by so maybe think about not bringing kids under 5 years old or so. All in all a wonderful couple of hours in another world which left me with a much better feeling about Disney. They do still seem to realize that telling a story is a way of escape and that's in essence what movies should be mostly all about!"
Bread,5,Wonderful adaptation of the original! Fresh and fun. Excited to see it again because Halle is such a lovely little mermaid.
Keegan,5,It was the best Disney remake. It brought my childhood back to life. I was singing and dancing in my seat. Ill be back to see it in 3D.
Emalea,5,"Best remake from Disney yet!!!! All the colors, new songs, more storyline. I was amazed at how well they were able to make my favorite movie even better."
ALICE Belcher,5,"The cinematography, the voice of Halley, the actors—awesome!  It was wonderful watching these little black girls coming out of the theater with their families—singing Aerials song with perfect pitch, wish I could be part of your world!-because they could see themselves projected in a Disney movie, which allows them to relate to the movie so well!  Grown men came out tearing up!  One of them said to me:  Thats one of the best movies I have ever seen.— as we both walked out of the theater.  This is a must see!  Take your kids!  Thank you, Disney!"
RG,5,I would see this movie over and over again. They did such an amazing job at filling in the missing pieces while also keeping it similar to the original. The cast was amazing & I love how realistic it seems.
Vernon,5,"Everything, the animation, new songs a fantastic phenomenal movie."
Brayden,5,Halle glows in this vibrant remake that is pretty faithful to the original.
Mrs Williams,2,The original cartoon was so much better... the singing and the characters were not giving me little mermaid vibes it just wasn't good to me
Ayana,5,"Perfect mesh of Pixar and Planet Earth, verbiage to describe ocean destruction- not over lavish or excessive princess detail, which would be fitting to see in a princess movie, but well done."
kamie g,5,I loved the slight changes and the new songs. The imagery was beautiful.
Heather,0,"Do not see this movie if you loved the original.  Added/deleted scenes, changed original songs, mediocre acting, dull colors, changed storyline, and WAY too long.  

Will not watch it again."
David G,5,It was a visual feast with glorious singing!
Jennifer,3,"As a whole, the movie was good. However, the music was terrible. Unnecessary songs added, lyrics changed to original songs. I'm sad because I love Lin Manuel Miranda. Hamilton still gets played daily in my home. But this soundtrack was not great. Adding Ariel to throw in an ""Under the Sea"" here and there during the song was misplaced. ""Kiss The Girl"" is my all-time favorite Disney song, and this version failed- it sounded like a watered down Kidz Bop version. Didn't give you the buildup that the original song did.

The parts that were understandably supposed to be darker were too dark. It was difficult to see some of those scenes.

Melissa McCarthy was outstanding. Daveed Diggs had us laughing every time Sebastian was onscreen. Awkwafina was just bad. We cringed with all of Scuttle's lines. And I normally like her, but in this movie it was just off.

It's Disney and it's The Little Mermaid so I'll still but a hard copy when it's available for our collection. But we were left semi-underwhelmed."
Kari,5,"A must see, perfection!!"
Elena,5,Surprisingly beautiful movie! The updates were subtle and still somehow kept the overall feeling of the movie. Really enjoyed it and want to see it again before its out of theaters.
Donna,5,"We thought the movie was absolutely great. I loved the 3D effects and the glasses made it perfect. My granddaughters loved it as well, who are 5 & 12. Halle did an amazing job."
Laura,5,Halle IS The little mermaid!!! Her voice was everything in this film. It was wonderful to watch!
Anastasia,5,"Halle was so amazing perfect for this role, love love love!!!"
Kendall,5,"Im a 90s kid and the cartoon was my first true obsession and halle was simply magical - ariels voice and spirit are vital to her character and she was enchanting - every acting and creative choice (esp the ones I questioned from
The trailer) that was made was incredibly executed and not a single new element  took away from the elements of the cartoon that were being recreated! the music was lovely and the characters were so likable"
Chris S,3,"A few bad CGI parts not a fan of the way they did Prince Eric. Also, not a fan of one of the songs"
Heather,5,It was a beautiful movie and really did justice to the original Disney film.
Jasmine,5,The film was very beautiful! Halle’s voice is magnificent and her acting was stellar! I’m glad I watched this film because I really enjoyed it.
Mallory E,5,My niece was dancing in her seat and I couldn’t help but laugh out loud and dance a little myself. We had a great time.
Carol,5,Historical and mythological context was added to this version.  Even facts about how sea creatures adapt to the environment were added. I loved seeing Jody Benson in the movie again.
Jusmejay27,5,Everything from the writing to the Music to the visual effects was amazing ! Best Disney Real life remake thus far !!! Can't wait to see it again in 3D!
cheryl,4,"From the dramatic opening of the ocean, beautiful to watch, actors chosen for this are perfect. The music, the undersea world beautiful, storyline kept me captivated. Had a lovely message of acceptance. This movie was created with love"
Denise C,3,It is very long and not attention grabbing however in todays world it has a happier ending than we get on any news program.
TDM,4,"Great movie! CGI wasn't the greatest, but it wasn't bad either. A great family friendly movie! Take your kids they will love it!"
Jessica,5,Halle Bailey's performance was the highlight of the movement. You feel all the emotions watching this. highly recommend

A beautifully done movie with OSCAR written all over it!! I took my Girl Scout Troop to see the movie and we LOVED it!!!
Christine,5,I loved everything about it!!! It was great!!! I’ve always love The Little Mermaid and it met my standards!!!
Jai,5,True to the Cartoon with minor tweaks that made sense.  I enjoyed the clearness of the ocean. Halle embodied the innocence of the original cartoon Ariel.  She was magical to watch and I can definitely see why she won the part.  Everytime she sang it was truly a Siren Song!  Definitely a must see
Randall D,3,Save your money and watch it on standard screen. 3D was a real let down. Ursula was a bit scary for young kids. But overall was kind of entertainment
First L,5,The casting was wonderful.  The story was great.
Xavier,5,"I was very skeptical at first when it came to watching this film. I must say, I do not regret watching it at all!.... All throughout I felt the magic of Disney. Being a fan of the original classic allowed me to look and appreciate the hard work put into this films and some amazing side character performances that stood out along side the main stars. Though it wasn't perfect, it was still amazing. This movie is easily a 9 out of 10 for me."
Ben,3,the film is beautiful and i MOSTLY had a great time watching it. Bailey and Mcarthy are the stand outs.
Amber,5,Loved this movie so much! Halle makes the perfect Ariel and Melissa McCartney was the best Ursula
Lkelly,5,"The witch and the crab was fantabulous!! The special effects were all beautiful! Loved the King! The chemistry between Ariel and the prince was very touching and I shedded a tear on a couple of scenes. Enjoyed all the castle and island fights people. The diversity of the whole cast was refreshing, even the scenery was great."
Johanna,5,Refreshing film. Loved the diversity. Simply AMAZING!
Nicole,5,I loved this movie. The representation from ALL cultures it was so raw so authentic the entire cast was just amazing
Ali,4,It was a good replica of the original. I liked a couple of the new songs they sang. Some of the singing you could tell was lip sang because it was off.
Jack T,4,"This story recharged Disney and I loved this reboot in live action!  All of the actors and actresses did their job splendidly and what could be better than more music by Lin Manuel?  I have heard critics pan this as a dud, and I say poo on them!  Take your loved ones and enjoy!"
Tiera,5,Loved this movie.  The underwater colors were so beautiful
dalyalah,5,Beautiful movie from start to finish didnt want it to end

Juandi,4,Halle Bailey was born for this role. She was amazing from the acting to the singing. The cgi was great & colorful. Overall very entertaining & well put together film. Made us Disney fans proud.
Johanna,5,"Me encanto, me gusto que mantuvieron la historia original, me gusto el efecto 4D, mis hijos y yo nos divertimos mucho, el efecto de estar nadando y ver esa maravilla de colores en el mar me encanto."
Aukai,5,Started off a little slow but I LOVED it! It was very nostalgic but new at the same time. Definitely recommend 100%

"Grizzy Miranda 
Grizzy M",5,"I absolutely love the movie. I laughed and cried, and of course, singing along."
Cory,5,A beautiful remake of the animated classic of the same name. Halle Bailey is incredible as Ariel and Mellisa McCarthy is terrifying as the sea witch Ursula. Every Disney fan will leave the theatre singing “under the sea!
Alex H,5,Loved it so much. So nostalgic but the re-imagination of a classic was iconic
steph,4,halles voice is amazing! Sebastians accent was AWFUL and king tritons acting was very wooden and underwhelming...overall i considered this movie more like an adaptation of the original ( like the live action Aladdin) than a remake (like B&B).
H,5,"I thought it was fantastic from the beautiful colors and textures of the era-accurate costumes to Halle Baileys stunning voice. The writing was strong and though some changes were made to story, I felt that they actually fixed some plot holes that the og film had. Halles portrayal of Ariel was absolutely astounding and I found the colors and aesthetic of the world building to be just lovely."
Cameron,5,A MUST SEE MOVIE! Halle Bailey was phenomenal and is a superstar in the making! She was perfectly cast as Ariel and the rest of the cast was Amazing as well. I’m buying my second ticket as we speak!

sabria,5,"My girl was phenomenal, PERIODT!!!!"
Kat Kessler,5,Loved everything! Amazing in every aspect!
Anthony Reyes,5,"such a great film , a work of art,  everyone was cast perfectly, especially Halle, she was born for this role, she brought her magic to Ariel, with her godly voice especially, you can just see that she gave her all into her strong yet effortless performance, it looked beautiful, every character had chemistry with each other, especially Jonah who gave a strong & handsome performance, Melissa was also great with her strong & fierce portrayal, the movie was funny, mostly because of our three animal friends who were brought to life by amazing talent, its romantic & a feast for the eyes, the music was obviously great with the barely noticeable but appreciated updates, the new music was great as well, just an iconic gorgeous film"
Shyra,5,Absolutely loved it. 10/10. Beautiful movie and soooo captivating.
Sheyla,1,"They did flounder dirty!! I didn’t like it I had high hopes for this movie, as it’s my favorite movie growing up…"
c,5,PHENOMENAL!!! Halle Bailey is the PERFECT Ariel!! She shines the entire time and that VOICE!!! Absolutely beautiful!
Chris,5,"I’m not a Disney guy but took my girl to watch this movie. She loved it and it’s kind of a reminder of her childhood. So since she loved it give it 5 stars. The characters were funny, plot was good, no complaints oh and animations were great"
Victoria Summers,5,Literally so amazing!!! I love that we have two little mermaid movies always been an absolute fan. The little mermaid has always been my favorite movie this live action is everything I couldve wanted!! My niece 6 loved!   She said she cried at the end I absolutely cried more than once!! Laughed the entire time. I will definitely be going again!!!
Maricel,4,Awesome ti see Ariel and her story come to life! I enjoyed the new scenes and seeing more of a connection between her & Eric!
esteban,5,everything was perfect. no one could’ve brought ariel to life but halle
Jennifer,5,I loved the movie!! The movie looked 3D just magical I took my 2 year old who has never been to the movies and she loved it!!
Keya,5,"I love the storyline, the optics were beautiful, Ariel is Really pretty BUT my only recommendation is to Not see it in 3D.. I feel that the 3D feature takes away from the movie instead of enhancing it"
Brandy,5,"Phenomenal I laughed I cried , I bawled"
Alex,5,"Stunning visuals, amazing performances, kept beloved parts and additions only enhanced the movie. Will be seeing several more times"

Alex LaStar,5,It was such a great moving to watch. Halle Baileys voice was just so beautiful to listen to and she portrayed Ariel very elegantly . I mean the entire cast was filled with amazing vocals and talent!! I recommend this film to anyone who isnt stuck on comparing the original animation to the live action!!
Anthony B,4,An incredible retelling of the classic story
Shawn,5,THIS WAS ABSOLUTELY THE BEST LIVE ACTIOK DISNEY HAS DONE!!!!!!
Mark  G,5,"10/10. Loved everything about this movie. The diversity of the casting, the graphics, the humor, the precise character portrayal. It is a must see movie!"
Harold J,5,"I just saw the Little Mermaid (2023), and I loved it!!! Rob Marshall and his team understood the assignment when it comes to making a Disney live action remake of a classic. You need to honor the original, but find ways to do things different and maybe fix any plot holes.

Pros:

Halle Bailey knocked out of the park as Ariel. To all of the naysayers that were pissed off that she was cast, SHUT UP!!!! For a role like this, it shouldn’t matter what race Ariel is. She had the look, the voice, and the acting to pull off this role. She sings “Part of Your World” very beautifully, as well as a new song. The fact that Jodi Benson passed the torch to Halle in movie and out of movie is truly high praise.

Javier Bardem was great as King Triton.

Melissa McCarthy won me over as Ursula. I was really worried that she wouldn’t be the right fit for Ursula, but she proved me wrong. The one thing I needed from her was for her to sing “Poor Unfortunate Souls,” and she did it and she sang it the right way. Thank you so much for that, Melissa!!!

Jonah Hauer-King was good as Prince Eric. He gets a better story arc and character motivation. He even gets a new song, “Uncharted Waters.”

Awkwafina was perfect as Scuttle. Every role she touches is gold. Now she just needs to have a role in Star Wars and she can complete the trifecta.

Daveed Diggs was good as Sebastian.

Jacob Tremblay was good as Flounder.

The directing was great. It was shot on location and shot well. The underwater scenes were beautiful.

All of the songs were done justice, and sung the right way. I even liked the new songs. Having Alan Menken back and Lin-Manuel Miranda is a just amazing. Disney is winning when these two are doing the music for their movies.

They fixed some plot holes and story beats to fit this version, and it works.

Cons:

It does feel like a drags a little throughout the movie. 

I wish we got more of Ariel’s sisters, but I get it’s not their story.

Overall, this remake is worth a watch. It will definitely be making the top tier list of the better Disney live action remakes with Beauty and the Beast (2017), Aladdin (2019), Maleficent, Cinderella (2015), and Cruella.

10/10 highly recommend"
Willie Reed,5,IT WAS ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL!!! I can’t wait to see it again and again
jonathan,5,It was amazing ! Cast was awesome love the extras they added in if people didn’t enjoy it they are closed minded and wouldn’t have liked it no matter what because it was a 10/10
Alex L,5,Halle Bailey!!!!! if you for one second had any doubt about her.... you will be proven wrong. she was AMAZING!!!!!! As was Melissa McCarthy and the rest of the cast.
Frank R,3,"kept true to the original Disney movie with a few added songs, some of which were very hard to sit through. The CGI could have been better and a few complaints but overall not bad. not great but not bad either."
Syed Ahmed N,3,This movie felt and looked dull. But the songs (originals) were great. The new songs weren’t necessary. 15 mins too long. Ariel was 10/10.
Austin J,5,One of the best Disney remakes thus far.
Jevante,5,Love love love 12/10
octavio,5,"no seafoam dress :(, and ariel’s sisters only had 30 seconds of screen time , over all very beautiful movie i would still recommend to watch"
Jasmine,5,Amazing!!!! They added more depth to Ariel and Eric’s characters. Halle Bailey was the perfect casting choice!
CHINA,5,Amazing adaptation to live screen! We felt like we were watching a Broadway musical in the best way. The characters were all amazing and they stayed true to all the parts of the original that we know and love  we were singing along to every word and smiling ear to ear.
Monet,5,Love how they stuck to the storyline and Halle was AMAZING!!!
Latoya,4,During the movie at one of the parts when Ariel is singing the sound cut off for a little while then pop back on hey say on Weseloh then the sound got very high at the movie theaters.
Christine,5,"I loved that they stick to the original along with some added extra surprises,"
Wayne,3,"The color appeared washed out leaving a dark visual,  The environmental comment seemed out of place."
mermaidFanboy,5,"I loved this move so much, the changes that they made to the movie made it fit the TODAYS woman. It fun, it was sad, the emotion of this movie was EVERYTHING!"
shani,5,everything this about this movie was amazing
Lyle,5,Absolutely beautiful film. Great music great effects! True in a lot of ways to the original! Great remake
kaialexis,4,such a wonderful movie! the cast were PERFECT picks!
cynthia m,5,LOVED this movie! SO beautiful & well done.
Britt,5,Phenomenal but I could have done without the singing from Eric
alex,5,HALLE BAILEY IS A STAR!!!!
Gaby V,4,"Reading a lot of reviews saying that nothing new is added, but I don’t think that’s true. I love that Prince Eric gets more depth and back story. The Caribbean vibe of the town is wonderful. Ariel’s sisters cleaning up the coral reef after yet another shipwreck. And that shipwreck scene was done so well! The acting and singing is amazing. Even Vanessa’s short time on screen stands out. The Little Mermaid stays true to the original with a few updates that just make sense (Eric and Ariel really are a true match “written in the stars”). Love it. I want to see it again in imax to really appreciate the vibrant scenes (yea it was a little dark in parts, but also the depths of the ocean are pretty dark, especially at night so…). All in all this is a film my daughters and I will definitely watch again and again. They said Sebastian and Scuttle were very funny!"
Deborah,5,Everything Well done enjoyed it very much
Nathaniel  J,5,Beautifully done !!!! Bravo 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾🧜🏾‍♀️🧜🏾‍♀️🧜🏾‍♀️
Kit,5,"Incredible retelling. Its beautiful, stunning, and a musical delight. Halle Bailey is a perfect Ariel, Melissa is Marvelously malicious, and Jonah is swoon worthy. Everyone shines in the best Disney live action remake to date. Everything i loved about the original mixed with cute new things. I cried. Go see this movie!!!"
Brandie,5,"Truly a beautiful and emotionally moving film that gives you such a sense of nostalgia with so much story and depth with this new movie. You can sit and listen to Halle sing all day, Jonah also! They were both beautiful as Ariel & Eric with great chemistry. Ursula, Triton, & even Sebastian were all captivating! The entire cast was perfect! 🩵🧜🏽‍♀️"
Google,5,It was rather fun! makes me wanna make a trip to the Bohamas! Can't wait for Lilo and Stitch next
TheSound2Jam1,4,Very Surprised! Bailey is perfection
Linds,5,Perfect couldnt have asked flr better
Angela R,5,"The movie was FABULOUS!! The music, the actors, the colors... AMAZING!! And I still cried at the end."
Jesse,5,Absolute beautiful film! 10 out of 10
Chocolateifj,4,A lovely representation of many talented people of all shades and shapes blended together. The vocals were perfect! I enjoyed this movie much more than I thought I would. Very nice!
Ariel,5,Amazing. i’m really speechless
Michael M,5,"This is one of the better live-action Disney films, which had the original songs and a couple new ones that didn't suck. You can tell having Lyn co-produce helped the whole ensemble come together magically."
Kell,5,I loved it.  The storyline is a little more in depth from its original and has a great plot and definition to meanings. Seeing it in 3D was awesome!
Amy,5,just incredible!  It honored the original film and filled in gaps.  I really fun experience.  Beautiful art and colors.  True art.  Well done!!
J,5,Brilliant adaptation of a classic
addya,5,It was AMAZING. Halle had me in awe the whole time
scuddlebutt,2,"No, It’s not the best live action Disney movie (Aladdin/Jungle Book), but that isn’t a total bummer. Halle is incredible and her voice alone will send chills down your fins. Supporting characters were wonderful and funny as the movie went by. The movie follows the formula of the original while adding some songs and story twists but to the core it’s the Little Mermaid you know and Love. The visuals and Prince Eric’s solo new song was painful. And it just doesn’t sweep you off your feet with it’s emotional ending, but the family enjoyed it as did the theater, who irrupted in applause."
b,2,"The volume was really low the first half of the movie, had to tell a worker twice if they can put the volume up!"
Miss rae,3,"I loved this movie but even before she lost her voice, ariels lines seemed limited. The magical aspect of the movie felt absent. However, the actress for ursela tryly brought the movie to life, she did an amazing job! most of songs did feel a little awkward but great nonetheless"
Google,5,It was 10/10. Loved every bit of it.
Gina,5,INCREDIBLE ! They did such an amazing job . Each character was cast so perfectly . My kids and i loved it so much !

Tamika Hartsfield,5,"My two daughters my daughter in law , my grandson and granddaughter enjoyed Lil Mermaid Halle did an Awesome Job playing the role as Airreal. I give it a thumbs up!!👍🏽❤️"
Paris S.,5,"So good! The story really doesnt stray too far from the original. Theres only one song missing that the original had that is not in this movie and it wasnt a big deal. It was great, would definitely watch again."
Tiffany G,5,Bravo Disney! Halle was amazing!! Loved it!!!
Ashley Lauren Miller,5,"I liked the way they stuck to the original script with some little extra touches here and there and the new songs that werent in the original too! It was an instant classic for us! We will be buying it without a doubt! 
Halle Bailey is Ariel!!!!!!"
Amber,5,The graphics were AMAZING!! This was so so good!!
samantha,5,Halle was a PERFECT Ariel!  Her voice is stunning and her acting fits the role of a Disney princess wonderfully

Azalea,5,Best movie ever I cried so much! Will be re watching

Cassius,5,Great film!!! Halle did such and amazingly beautiful job!! The whole cast matter of fact! Great great production
Ashley T,5,"THE MOVIE WAS AMAZING!! THE GRAPHICS, THE TALENT, HALLE IS A STAR!!!!! THIS MOVIE IS A MUST SEE !!!"
Val,5,BEST MOVIE OF 2023! I love how they developed the story from the original movie and the chemistry between Ariel and Eric was elite! 😍😍😍 The Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea in theaters next year 🤞
Mikalia B,5,"When I was a little girl I was ENAMORED with The Little Mermaid. She was the best singer, and that naturally drew me to her in addition to her adventurous spirit. My room was covered in Ariel from sheets, decals, comforter, poster and of course the Ariel sized pillow. This new adaptation does MORE than pay homage to the first. It is spectacular in every way. Ive never gone out of my way to rate a movie but I had to for this one. I have a few minor passing things but overall I loved it. Halle SHINES as Ariel Im every way. I loved almost all of the the new song adaptations (except one)  and thoroughly enjoyed the sounds of the Caribbean throughout. My childhood self is beaming ear to ear. I definitely choked back my tears at the end. And it brings me a little extra joy to know Ariel now looks like me."
Michael B,5,Absolutely loved this movie. The original was my favorite movie growing up and this brought back many great memories. Halle is amazing and her voice is the BEST.
Vanessa,5,"It’s received a lot of criticism even before it came out, but as someone who loved the original Disney little mermaid, this one also stayed very true to the storyline, very few add ins, but overall great movie!"
Emory,5,Lovely for a second time around
Kerissa B,5,Halle did an amazing job!! I cried 5 minutes in and several times throughout. So beautiful and the visuals were astounding. Melissa McCarthy did great as Ursula too!
Christine M,5,Beautiful movie. Just absolutely beautiful!
Merle M,5,"Excellent movie, did a great job following the original. Singing was amazing."
Seth,5,Beat my expectations by a million percent!
Kennard,5,This movie was amazing!
Google,5,I loved the live-action version of Disney’s The Little Mermaid! I remember watching the movie as a little girl and felt just as captivated by this version as I did back then. The ending made me tear up. Halle’s voice is phenomenal and Melissa McCarthy did her thing! The casting was spot on!
Anissa C,4,It seems Hallee Bailey was born for this role. Very charming film & the visuals were stunning! I thought the cast was good too!
Jonathan F,5,"Such a fun, and true to story, adaption of The Little Mermaid that we all know and love!"
Winter,5,"The little mermaid was amazing from beginning to end a true love story , and a family must see"
JOSEPH D,5,"Halle Bailey and Melissa McCarthy brought it in this gorgeous adaptation. And speaking of gorgeous… Jonah Hauer-King😍. Special nod to Noma Dumezweni, in a small role here, but brings excellence to the screen as always!"
Destiny,5,They did amazing. New music was perfectly written and performed.
Casandra,5,It was such an amazing live action remake and I don’t say that lightly. The cinematography was great and the CGI was fun. Great musical numbers! My son even said he liked it better than the Mario Movie!!!
Andy G,5,"I absolutely LOVED this movie. Halle Bailey was incredible as Ariel. She drew me in every time she was on screen. Melissa McCarthy also surprised me with her performance as Ursula. Overall, it's clear the people making this movie truly understood what makes these classic Disney stories feel magical, and they were able to bring that magic to life (imo) better than any other live action Disney remake has done. Oh, and see it in 3D if you can!"
C G O,4,"Solid movie. It was not as dark as everyone tried to make it out to be. Underwater scenes were well lit and colorful except for Ursulas cave which was dark with fluorescent colors. The new songs felt ver broadway/musical theater compared traditional Disney songs. Best change was adding to the Eric character. He was fleshed out more and, I felt, did a lot of heavy lifting with Halle. Daveed added to the levity. Would watch it again."
Anthony,4,It was a story retold with more in-depth characters development. Definitely bridged gaps in the original and it seemed to have more life.
AngieB,5,Finally! A live action remake done right! I loved it!
Debbie B,5,"Absolutely wonderful, my granddaughters enjoyed it as much as their Nana. Loved it!"
Eric,5,"The Little Mermaid had a lot to live up to considering it’s predecessor is a classic and beloved Disney movie that single handed saved the Disney co. From bankruptcy and started a “renaissance” of Broadway styled musical movies spawning Aladdin and Beauty and the Beast just to name a few. In my opinion, it is safe to say that The Little Mermaid (2023) Does not disappoint, at least on most levels. The visuals are beautiful in many areas particularly “Under The Sea” bringing to life a wide array of colorful sea life to screen, some you may recognize and some maybe not, but they are wonderful to see nonetheless. Halle Bailey is a near perfect Ariel  she captures the innocence and yearning of the character and has a powerhouse voice to boot. She’s incredibly charming in the role and she will have a lustrous career after this for sure. Another standout is Melissa McCarthy as Ursula the sea witch. I was one to discredit McCarthy in the beginning  I thought she would reduce the role to a SNL spoof of Ursula but boy I was wrong. She brought out her inner diva and it’s great to watch. Some things could’ve been left out (a new song called The Scuttlebut comes to mind) and other things should’ve been left in (Chef Louis and the song Les Poisson were totally MIA) but the most part the additions/subtractions didn’t hurt the movie. It wasn’t perfect but it was certainly alot better than other live action adaptations I’ve seen so far. 4/5 stars Go see it if not only for seeing Halle Bailey become a STAR."
Nonny,5,"Just got out of seeing this movie. It was pretty great!! I must say, the trailers and tv spots don't do the visuals any justice. Watched it in IMAX and it was absolutely stunning!! The actors are all great, especially the lead characters. The chemistry between the lead characters (Halle & Jonah) is insane! Off the charts! The story is the same as the original but more expanded upon in a good way. And Halle's voice....THAT VOICE! Overall, pretty solid movie. The time just passes by and you don't feel the runtime. Definitely recommend it, especially for families. Gonna see it again, hopefully not seated with kids behind me again, because the kids  behind me kept laughing, singing along and talking so much. Which I suppose is fun, but a bit distracting lol"
Veronica S,5,True enough to the original with a modern twist
Kristy,5,"It was a fun and refreshing spruce up of the original Little Mermaid story line. All the iconic scenes were present along with newly well appointed ones. Like the rap by Scuttle, Scuttlebutt. I also enjoyed the slight remixes in the original songs, most notably in Under the Sea."
Sabrina,5,Best live action Ive ever seen!! Very true to the original with a few twists! Absolutely love and will rewatch again and again for years to come
Chi,5,"Amazing movie, great graphics, music was so beautiful! Highly recommend"
mehh,4,One of the best live remakes Disney has put out. Sebastian steals the show but the dynamics between Ariel and Eric is great! King triton was definitely the weakest part of the whole film.
Trident of Cali,5,"Halle is absolutely Ariel! I never cried in cinemas but this movie just made me right when she sang Part Of Your World. Everyone did a fantastic job, Melissa Mccarthy omg!!!  Cant wait to rewatch it over and over again!"
Andrea,5,"Wow! It was literally amazing! The whole theater laughed and applauded together. What a time. As much as I loved the first one, this one was so great also! The acting through and through was great - Halle did amazing! My daughter wants to see it again and so do I so we will!"
jose,5,AMAZING HALLE IS ARIEL
Shawn,5,Excellent remake of a classic tale. CGI was unbelievably real and the revised music was perfect for this updated version. I will see it again and maybe even a third time. May be a bit dark (scary) for little ones under 5 but that speaks to the creators and actors. LOVED IT and so did my 37 year old daughter and her daughter.
Jess,5,Great movie loved that it flowed so well with the original movie
YU-CHUN C.,2,Not sure this need a live action movie.
Reese,5,Halle Bailey is phenomenal. Shes a star in the making!
Celia,4,"It was a little too long but the movie was very well done. The acting, scenery & special effects were on point!"
Kpete,5,The Little Mermaid 2023 is so sweet and very endearing just like the first one. The mix of live action and cartoon was done so expertly. I sang along with all the familiar songs as well as the rest of the theater. Just missed the scene with the chef and Sebastian trying to escape the buffet table. Some scenes might be scary for really young ones. They made Ursula pretty dark and ominous.
Kemin R,5,Enjoyed this so much. Halle’s voice is so beautiful!
Gloria,5,It was magical my baby girl loved it
Virginia,5,"Wonderful! Visually great, beautiful performances by the actors.   I would recommend to all"
Stephanie M,5,"Awesome Movie,even cried at the end!!!!!Very Enjoyable movie!!!!"
Christina,5,"I loved it! Its super cute, the visuals are great. The added songs will sing to your soul and give you goosebumps. A must-see for the whole family."
Brianna,5,Loved it! Great adaptation that still closely followed the original movie. Definitely felt like the 2 hours flew by and was left wanting more. I will absolutely go see this again while it’s in theaters!
Ty W,5,"This is easily Disney’s best live action film, Halle Bailey’s siren song puts you under a trance and you feel apart of her world. McCarthy’s Ursula was brilliant, and perfectly camp. I can see myself re-watching this film as many times as I did the original when I was a kid. Definitely recommend this, you don’t want to miss out on this film, Disney still brings the magic it did 34 years ago✨"
Angel C,5,Loved my girl halle she did amazing!!
Jaron,5,"HALLE BAILEY WAS AMAZING! The voice, the songs, the story! i can't wait to watch it again!!!"
Carolyn Brents,5,DISNEY DID NOT DISAPPOINT US!!! IT WAS AMAZING!!
Jahzz,5,"LOVED IT, as well as my five year old! Halle Bailey played an AMAZING Ariel as did Melissa McCarthy with Ursula! The music was everything just like the original and they added a few things that just brought the movie all together! Would definitely watch again in theaters! 💖"
Courtney,5,This was a great family movie and a must see I was thoroughly entertained throughout the entire movie honestly a must see
Shonda  R,5,"This movie was beyond amazing! Absolutely loved seeing a black mermaid and her voice is spectacular, the prince voice was amazing also. Great cast"
Dyane,3,They missed the part where their in the kitchen and Sebastian gets thrown almost in a pot
Diana,5,"Everything about this movie is just fantastic!!! Amazing actors, every single cast did not disappoint."
Amanda,5,We absolutely loved everything about this movie
Isabella,5,"It was beautiful 
The best Disney live action ever 
I loved it and I would watch it again"
AC,4,"Halle shines in this and makes a perfect Ariel. The whole cast does an amazing job especially the actor for Prince Eric. While not without its issues, I think this is Disney's best live action movie."
Kimi C,5,"It was an absolute blast watching this movie! Sure the CGI and some of the lighting could be better but I was laughing and having a ton of fun watching it. Halle Bailey’s voice is utterly breath taking. The changes they made definitely fit the movie better and you can tell the cast had so much fun making it. At the end, kids and adults (including me) in the theater were applauding. Honestly feel like it’s the best live action remake Disney has done so far. Will definitely watch it again"
Alfredo C,5,It was so good. Definitely recommend!
Tori H,5,"Beautiful remake. This movie is the perfect example of diversity, equality, and inclusion. Miss Halle was flawless and Ursula amazing."
Joshua W,5,I liked this movie SO MUCH. Definitely one of the best live action Disney films so far.
Vinny,4,For a remake it was very well done. Great graphics and music and love that they stuck to the original but managed to add parts that didnt take away from the story. Definitely a great updated version. Family fun
R. LaVon,5,I loved everything about The Little Mermaid and was so happy to see the different cultures represented throughout. The vocals and music were amazing as well as animation. I laughed and almost cried on a few parts. It was definitely worth the wait! Now I just need it on DVD for my car )
jasmin,5,HALLE DID AN AMAZING JOB :’) LOVE LOVE LOVE would watch again 100%💝💝
Nathan H,5,"I’m not a big fan of most of the Disney live-action remakes, but this one is GOOOOD!!! It’s maybe even better than the original cartoon one. Well, maybe not that good, but gosh it was good. I can’t imagine it NOT going on to make a billion dollars. It might even make 2 billion! The graphics are more visually stunning than Avatar, and the romance is more gripping and tear-jerking than Titanic. It couldn’t exactly replicate some of the classic scenes from the original cartoon because some things that work for cartoons don’t really work for live-action. But they found the things that do work with live-action and made it work. They did a good job with this one!"
Cory,5,"wow wow wow, saying Halle did that role justice is an understatement! the entire case brought the magic we love from the original movie, with a colorful imaginative twist! 1000/10!🤩"
Juanita,5,We love it! Good job Halle! Brings me back to my childhood.
kelly,5,"OMG…. Where do I start! Graphics, nostalgic, action packed, the MUSIC was amazinggggg!!! I love how it connected to the original, the movie was all around great from the beginning to the end! Well don’t cast."
Cleo C,5,It was a great love action adaptation!! Halle did a great job!
Sharonda,5,"I loved that it followed the original movie. The new scenes went great and was cohesive with the original. Halle did amazing and Ursula played the role to the T! Great movie, I will see again!"
Matthew,5,I saw the movie with my kids in 3D it was beautiful the underwater scenes were amazing !! Melissa McCarthy played Ursula very well . All around a good movie not sure about 2D but 3D was really awesome !!
DonnaMarie W,5,Videography & CGI were outstanding. The musical performances were spectacular. Add'l songs & lyrics fit seamlessly.
Mimi,5,Amazing!!!!! Just BEAUTIFUL ❤️😫
KB,5,Absolutely loved it. My grand babies loved it as well. I will be going back to see it again.
Patrick G,5,I was hesitant to watch this being a man and 42 years old but I cracked a tear at the end. It was very good and heartwarming
Bailee,5,Absolutely wonderful.
Haley M,5,"An all around good time! Stop overthinking it, just go watch and have fun. Listening to Halle Bailey sing is worth the price of admission alone."
Darci,5,This movie was everything I imagined it would be. My 4 year old enjoyed it so much !
Little Mermaid must see,4,Loved every single bit
Linda,5,Loved the theatre! It was awesome!
Brian,4,In typical Disney fashion the story was great and the production was outstanding. There were spots where the movie got a little disjointed.
Virgo,5,loved it! although they change a few things from the original
Pattamales,4,10/10 best Disney remake ever!! Goosebumps
Scarlett C,5,The acting was quite impressive (especially Melissa McCarthy). It was done very well and the nostalgia I felt even made me tear up a few times.
Jovan,2,"I think this would have been an amazing movie if we got to finish it, unfortunately the theater had the volume so loud the kids were literally crying and not just the ones with me. The ocean scenes were stunning, the Ariel was beautiful and seemed to play the part beautifully. I do feel it was a little too grown up for the kids to follow but over all I think it would have been a pretty great movie if not for a bad theater experience but we will watch at home when it’s available for sure."
dee,5,Great Great movie !!!!!!
Jeanellbeautyxo,5,The little mermaid was a beautiful movie. I enjoy every moment. I laughed and I cried. Halle Bailey was amazing😍
Sophia,5,loved loved loved the movie!!
Javontai,5,Absolutely amazing movie! It was a bit different than the original but done so well!!
Sarah,5,I loved it. The Little Mermaid was the first movie I ever saw in the theater when I was little and I was brought right back to being a kid again. They did an amazing job with the casting. A few new surprises but they really did this classic justice
Luis,5,It was really fun! Loved the musical numbers and loveeed Halle Bailey as ariel. She was really great! My only complaint would be that some scenes were a little too dark a few times. But there were a lot of bright and colorful scenes!
Santana,5,Go see it! Worth it! Go Hailey
Aicha,5,everyone needs to see it. Halle played Ariel so well. it’s amazing. transcendent truly
Marshall,4,"The Little Mermaid remake is a magical fairytale with breathtaking underwater sequences and beautiful romance. The film does fall short of the animated original at times, and the live action fish characters take a bit to get used to. However, the songs brought tears to the audience (especially Hallie Bailey’s Part of Your World) and the set design and performance from Bailey transports you to a classic fairytale brought to life. I recommend this film for a family night at the movies."
Jaunide,5,Everyone I hoped it would be. Magical
Xavier  H,4,one of the better live action Disney adaptions in my book (the other being jungle book). felt halle bailey was fantastic as Ariel despite the online trolls who wanted to scream WOKE and review bomb the movie. it kept ALL  the songs from the original movie and added some of its own tbh kinda feels like its own thing. give it a shot y'all
Cindy T,5,Loved the cinematography...great new songs by Lin Manuel
Eileen,4,"It's a kids movie so, you gotta look at it that way lol. Very colorful and whimsical, I thought that animal characters were funny! I was entertained,  its a good family movie."
Thell,5,Great movie!!!  The movie represented everyone!!
Serena W,4,"Just watched The Little Mermaid 🧜‍♀️ It lacked personal and/or emotional connection with Ariel & Eric. There are other scenes that can be better. However, I cried toward the end because a Father’s love is greater than the deepest ocean 🌊 in the world. So that was a plus! The movie is different in other aspects of the storyline, and was very interesting to watch. Overall, the movie  🍿 was great and very good for the family & especially kids! Ariel (Halle) had the most beautiful voice, so influential, mesmerizing, catching, and amazing! She’s adorable, sweet, wonderful, beautiful, and lovable. Regardless, I would still give this movie 🎥 a 9/10 😘😝"
Jess,4,"Beautiful Cgi and fun songs, loved the actors"
Hilary,5,It was pretty amazing! Best live action Disney movie ever!!! Super close to the movie! I loved every minute of it!
Kai,5,Halle Bailey was amazing! Movie 10/10 🔥the definition of a great life action movie
ArielFanSince '89,5,"The movie kept mostly to the original Disney animated film, which made this fan very happy. The updates are minimal except for one plot point, and I won't spoil it but it has to do with the ending. it doesn't stray too far from what viewers know and love."
Creshaunda H,4,"Wonderful modern take on a Disney classic! The acting was fantastic, especially Halle and Melissa. The climax needed a little finessing, but otherwise, a true delight. I'm so glad this generation gets to see such unity on screen."
Marcia W,5,Amazing my girls loved it
Juwan H,5,It was great to see Halle Bailey as Ariel. She did a n amazing job!
Carla,5,Soooo amazing!!! I’m SPEACHLESS! Hallie was so great! Wonderful! Just wonderful!

EMA,5,"Oh my gosh. I loved every second of this movie. Every new song was good, every original song was done justice. Halle and Jonah are phenomenal as Ariel and Eric! Even my mom loved it more than she thought she would. We're definitely gonna go see it again. Best live Action disney remake so far! I'm so happy 😭"
Edward P,4,Most enjoyable Disney remake in a very long time. Perhaps a better watch than the animated original.
Shakira,3,"This movie was cute. Nothing beats the original, but this one definitely sparks some nostalgia."
Jonathon Leedom,5,Best live action Disney movie ever!!!!!!!!!!!!
shreeya s,5,"halle bailey is a star, there is truly no better casting than her. this movie has all the elements you love about the original but rob marshall manages to bring his own delightful twist to it. i’ll definitely be rewatching this soon."
Sarah,5,Amazing!  Halle Bailey is a perfect Ariel. She's truly a Fisney Princess with the voice of an angel.
Denise,3,"Main actress lacked charisma, no romantic chemistry between leads, 
Good choice of Melissa McCarthy as Ursula and Javier Bardem as Triton."
BC,5,"The cast is phenomenal! Loved every minute of the film. Colorful, delightful and engaging. Halle Bailey is perfect for the role of Ariel. Her voice is beautiful.  Melissa McCarthy's  portrayal of Ursula is beyond my expectations. My family absolutely loved the film. Bravo to everyone involved. The amount of effort that went into making this film came through on the screen."
Victor,4,Great remake. Ursula and Ariel are great! still prefer OG Ursula.
Matthew,5,One of the best Disney remakes ever!
Camille,5,It was amazing! Halle is Ariel!!!!!! It was sooo good!
Miracle,5,Absolutely amazing! The whole cast did incredible! I will be seeing this many more times in theaters and getting the dvd!!!
Aryana,3,not as accurate to the original as i was expecting. definitely overhyped not too entertaining
Jon,5,"The original animated film has always been so near and dear to my heart, and I think this adapted remake compliments the original while still made into its own! Sure, some songs were rewritten/removed or some of the underwater sequences looked funny, but I appreciate how they expanded some of the characters and their motives and made more modern story choices. After seeing this film, I couldn't imagine anyone else playing Ariel better than Halle Bailey. She embodied so much of Ariel's personality, with a stellar voice. Might see this again over the weekend!"
Marquise W,3,It's not the greatest live action but it's entertaining enough to at least watch once. It's not a frame by frame adaptation and sometimes the acting could be better but overall I don't feel like I completely wasted my time.
Brittany,5,It was everything and more… So beautiful and I could not stop watching. This is a wonderful movies
Lea,5,they stayed true to the original with some of the dialogue and even added two extra songs! i don’t care what y’all say but this is the best live action remake and Halle Berry OWNED this period point blank
David,5,"Fantastic film! Halle Bailey is incredible as Ariel, the entire cast was perfect. The songs, the score, the added story elements were everything I hoped for. I will be seeing this one over and over again in the theater!"
Hugo R,5,I liked the full movie
Andrew,5,Loved it. My family enjoyed every min.
Sean N,5,"Not only is this the best Disney live action adaptation, it’s the best film Disney has released in years. It honored and heightened the original and left me singing and dancing as I left the theater. This is a perfect film for the summer!"

B. Rivera,5,Don’t let the internet fool you into thinking this movie isn’t good. Everything about this movie for the time is awesome! If you are stuck on the 1989 version of The Little Mermaid. Remind yourself that it was a cartoon and nobody knows what a mermaid looks like. So don’t cheat yourself or your kids by not experiencing this film.
Tarsha,5,A Modern Fantastic movie and beautifully cast!! Well done!
Melanie L,5,I’ve waited so long for this movie and it was even better than I thought it would be. Hallie did her thing! And Melissa McCartney was great too!!
Google,5,"This is a reimagining of a family classic. Halle, Melissa, and the whole cast bring the story to new heights. Melissa brings her humor to the character of Ursula while Halle embodies Ariel with the voice of the Gods."
Dhuwells,5,Great movie! Halle Bailey was AMAZING as Ariel

Bobby,3,king trident with all the power of the oceans couldn't put his daughter that he gave his died for a new dress or a rainbow ? and where was the chef v sebastian fights ? other than that it was cute
Anonymous,5,A well done remake.  Halle Bailey did a marvelous job as Ariel.  We were disappointed that Under the Sea didn't have many animals singing but the rest of it made up for it.
Shante,5,So good!! Omg better than I expected!
Stephen P,5,Faithful to the original. Highly entertaining
kemabema,5,I really enjoyed the live version and cast of the little mermaid.. the scene when Ursula becomes a giant in the water is awesome.. that was one of the scenes I didn’t think they would be able to fulfill. But they did and the movie was awesome!!
Antoinette,5,Amazing movie. Great cast I found myself more engaged than my children.
Norma Jaime,5,Oh my goodness 🤩 I absolutely loved it! Going again and again.
Simone,5,Great movie! Daughter loved the music
Deborah,5,It was absolutely amazing loved everything they did a fabulous job on this movie .
Papenogn,5,"As a long time Little Mermaid fan/obsesser, I loved this movie. After we all got over the appearances of Ariels friends, the songs were almost the same as the old movie with a couple fun new ones. A lot of lines and scenes were also an exact match to the original film which I really enjoyed. Only comment is that Ursula is terrifying near the end, especially if youre taking young ones."
PayPal U,5,So good.  Daveed Diggs as Sebastian was a brilliant choice.  The updated music is 10/10.
Seashells,5,The soundtrack makes you dance in your seat! The visual effects made you feel like you were in a coral reef and the casting was spectacular!
Monica G,5,"This movie was even better than the original!!! I loved it so much! The music, the story, it was superb!"
Liam Nagle,4,"If Disney is going to keep releasing live-action remakes, and they will, then this is how they should do it, with attention to detail in every aspect of the film, improving on elements from the past but keeping what worked. Dion Beebe used the fact that characters were suspended in water to film conversations in a completely new light, but captured the landscapes above with an equally enthralling grandeur. The musical sequences could hardly have been better, and the movie was more romantic than I could have expected."
Miaela T,5,It exceeded my expectations for a live remake! Can't wait to see it again in 3D!
Monique,5,I loved that the main character was black. There was no discrimination and representation of all backgrounds were present in the film.
A P,5,Ready to rewatch already and it’s not even over!
darreshagray L,5,Amazing kiddos loved it
keiona,5,Very good movie. Beautiful singing
Danielle Y. Harris,5,"I have been waiting for this movie to come out and it did not disappoint!  Halle's voice was perfect for role.  I loved the music, beautiful costumes, colorful scenery, and the love story.  I was also very pleased to see the diversity and multiculturalism represented throughout. It was an honor to support this film during opening week. 

Sebastion and Founder were phenomenal in their supporting roles. So cute, I loved them!

Don't hesitate, go see this movie!"
ME,5,Wonderful 👏🏽 Just like the original except for the obvious. Music was also the same. Well done.
faith,5,"Sooo Good! Everybody’s acting was great, the characters were great, the music were great. I loved it and just So proud and happy for Halle! Go see it!"
Lavenli,5,"LOVE LOVE LOVEEEEEE HALLE IN THIS ANS RHE OTHERS! MY INNER CHILD WAS HEALED AT THE END, SO LOVELY"
Kobe,4,"I enjoyed it, the actress who played Ariel did an excellent job as the character and the songs were done beautifully throughout the film"
MarianneOnFandango,5,"So good! I loved it! Halle has an amazing voice, the chemistry between her and Jonah is great, Melissa is spot on as evil Ursula and the cameo is perfect for this movie."
Claudine Loper,5,"I loved the Little Mermaid movie, I'd definitely see it again. I liked that the mermaids were of different colors, it was just an all around good movie."
Michael,5,YES YES YES. JUST YES
Rebecca  P,3,The scary stuff was way over the top.  Ruined it completely.
emily,5,Loved it! Even all the added scenes from the original! Amazing and so funny!!!
Brian,5,Halle Bailey is stunning and perfect as Ariel! Disney had nailed this live action version!! I even danced and was singing in the theater!
Demetra,4,"Overall, it was a good updated version of the movie. The CG was beautiful and vibrant. The casting of the main characters was good and each brought their own flair to the movie. The only criticism is it was slow in the beginning."
Andrew,5,It was a phenomenal movie definitely one of the best live action that Disney has done. They did a great job for telling the story while still putting in modern spin on it.
Michael T,5,Don’t believe the negative reviews. Incredible!!!!
Brandie S,5,A MUST SEE. We loved it! It was amazing to see the scenes of the movie come to life. Halle Bailey was perfect for this role and was excellent as Ariel. Don’t think no about it. Just got!
Jane H,5,love the movie and music
Secret,5,culturally stunning!!
Marilyn R,5,Excellent adaptation on the original! Loved the diverse cast! Good job Disney!
Cathy,5,Halle voice is incredible   I really enjoyed the movie...watched it in 3D
Jussy Z,4,"great movie. you will enjoy it. period. music, Sebastian, Ariel, mhmm."
Sharonda,5,"Exactly, how I remember it from my childhood! Disney never fails with their casting."
Mimi,4,"The movie was excellent. Halle did a fantastic job. I couldn’t be more proud of her. She captured Ariel perfectly. Her voice and her acting, when she lost her voice were excellent. The chemistry with Jonah was spectacular. The new songs felt like they were already in the original, except for the scuttlebutt, but even that wasn’t that bad in the movie. Overall I loved it!"
Tyana I,2,It was great to see an African American woman play Ariel which was my reason for going because representation in this climate is important. I’ve never watched the animated version and I dozed off for most of the film but I’m happy to support the film
Allie,5,One of the best live action remakes.
Tiff,5,Halle’s singing really just goes straight through your heart. This movie was perfectly remade.
Javi,5,This movie was everything I hoped for and more. I’m in love!
Kayla F,5,"Absolutely stunning movie , Halle was amazing in this, her voice , the acting , the music , everything was top tier"
Alejandro L,5,Best Live Action Disney movie ♥️♥️♥️
Jnn,4,"Halle Bailey is beautiful.
Melissa McCarthy is excellent as Ursula.
The actor who played Eric did a good job.
Scuttle and Sebastian were hilarious.
The CGI was horrible but the movie was still entertaining. 
I prefer the 2nd half of the movie rather than the 1st half."
Patricia,4,"This was my second time seeing it, noticed a lot more small details. Loved it so much, Halle was just incredible and loved Daveed as Sebastian"
Parker,5,"I’ve seen this movie twice already and still can’t get enough of it. Yes it is THAT GOOD. Halle is so amazing as Ariel, and there is so much laughter in this film. Along with all our favorite songs."
leticia  r,5,I loved that they kept most of the scenes from the original mermaid and I loved the ending
Jose,5,I hope the people who hate this movie simply because the lead is of color know that you’re going to rot for having such hatred inside of you. You guys are disgusting and the problem with the world. This movie is beautiful and honestly more entertaining than the original.
Darwin B,5,"an absolute must see, halle bailey is a star, this movie is everything"
Captain Becks,5,One of the best reimaginings. Maybe the best. They replicated a lot of shots while still providing fresh material. The character designs were really good and all the undersea scenes were so beautiful.
Diego G,5,The Little Mermaid is entertaining . Halle Bailey is amazing as Ariel!
Victoria A,5,"The undersea world is beautiful. Some of it is dark, yes. Not only is that more realistic, I think it's an artistic way of showing how sad & out of place Ariel feels. She longs to know more about the surface world & explore. The lighting difference up there shows how the curiosity brightens up her heart & her happiness in finding a place she belongs. It's a beautiful & creative way to showcase this. And that just because we may be different, that doesn't make us enemies. Also, the song they added For the First Time is awesome. My son is hard of hearing & mostly nonverbal. I can't wait to watch this with him"
ReviewedByNick,4,"Alright. Here we go. I just saw an advanced screening of #TheLittleMermaid and I really enjoyed it! Halle Bailey IS Ariel! She has a commanding voice, and really channeled the animated Ariel very well!! Part Of Your World is truly something special by her. I thought her performance was magnificent. Daveed Diggs as Sebastian was pure gold! I couldn’t get enough of him! And Melissa McCarthy as Ursula was a great choice! Poor Unfortunate Souls by her was Pitch Perfect! Now there are some new songs in this live action version. And they were fine. I was not a fan of Eric’s song, but it was passable. The look of the sea and the vibrant colors, really popped! I honestly think it’s better than Avatar 2’s visuals. But to each their own. I saw this in 3D and I was annoyed that the screening was in 3D, but I honestly thought it ADDED a nice bit to some of the ocean scenes. Do I think this movie is better than the original? In some ways, yes. In others no. But overall, I know kids will absolutely enjoy this movie, and adults who grew up with the original classic, will get a kick out of it. Also, kudos to Disney and their new #Disney100 opening! I enjoyed that so much! So many little easter eggs in that alone! I give The Little Mermaid: 4 Dinglehoppers Out of 5. #Review #MovieReview The Little Mermaid hits theaters this Friday. Thanks to Disney for the Advanced Screening Passes. 

Side note: I lost a very close friend of mine a few years ago. And she loved The Little Mermaid. I know she would have loved this movie. To my heavenly mermaid, Amy 🫶🏽🧜‍♀️"
Carlos R.,4,"Awesome performances (acting + singing) from Halle Bailey and Melissa McCarthy. They are Ariel and Ursula. Daveed Diggs is fun and great as Sebastian as well as Awkwafina as Scuttle. I enjoyed all but one of the newly added scenes which leads into one of My criticisms. I wasn't feeling the new song for Prince Eric. I think My only other issue is that the CGI looks great at times and then not so much other times. Other than that, go check it out in IMAX or Dolby."
Bibiano,5,"I was a bit hesitant about a live action, but its a bit different from the original. Highly recommend."
Derky2,5,"While I’ve enjoyed some of the live actions remakes, this is the first time I’ve felt like we’ve seen a princess come to life! Halle’s performance is worth the prices of a ticket alone! I enjoyed see all of the numbers adapted to real life and even found myself trying to see along to some of the new songs. Definitely a must watch."
Brady,5,Fantastic film which lived up to my expectations!
Daniel K,3,"The animated version was much better! The romantic leads seemed mismatched, so I did not really care whether they got together or not.
The music was still beautiful, the Kiss the Girl scene was magical.
I would definitely see it in IMAX, the water scenes are definitely enhanced by it."
Robert E. Acuna,4,"Son of a fish, this Disney remake actually slaps like a tsunami. Rob Marshall succeeds where a lot of these Disney remakes fail. It elevates the past mistakes and adds depth to parts that need it. While not flawless, The Little Mermaid is exactly what all of these remakes should strive to be."
Alejandrina,4,CGI was a little off but other than that great experience and execution.
Daniel,3,Good family movie. Pays good tribute to classic but classic is still in a league of it’s own
